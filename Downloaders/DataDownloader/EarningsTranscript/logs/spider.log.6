[Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce your host, Michael York, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Michael York Good morning, and welcome to Amylin Pharmaceuticals' quarterly update conference call. We've uploaded a presentation to accompany this conference call that provides additional background on the quarter. This morning's discussion will contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are outlined in today's press release, the website presentation and in our recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our actual results could differ materially from what is discussed during today's call. A reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found at the end of the website presentation. Let [Audio Gap] of the Amylin management team here today: Daniel Bradbury, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Foletta, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Vince Mihalik, Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing and Chief Commercial Officer.  I will now turn the call over to Dan Bradbury. Dan Bradbury Thanks, Michael, and welcome to our first quarter call for 2011. Before I begin with our prepared remarks, I'd like to say that we are very pleased to announce that BYDUREON has received a positive recommendation from the European Regulatory Authority. We believe the recommendation reflects the beneficial impact of BYDUREON therapy that we have seen throughout the DURATION clinical program. With just one dose per week, BYDUREON has consistently demonstrated in patients with type 2 diabetes, powerful glucose control, the potential for weight loss and a favorable safety and tolerability profile.  Receiving a positive opinion from the European agency is a pivotal step towards marketing authorization for BYDUREON in the European Union. And in conjunction with Eli Lilly and Company and Alkermes, we look forward to keeping you appraised of further developments regarding our European application. With this positive recommendation, we now expect marketing authorization for BYDUREON within 2 to 3 months in Europe. Regarding the first quarter of 2011, our comments this morning will build on the press release issued earlier today. In a few moments, Mark will provide additional details on the quarter's underlying financial results and comment on our outlook for 2011. Vince will then review our commercial activity during the first quarter of 2011.  Over the last quarter, we had numerous developments that I'd like to take a moment to reflect upon. Firstly, and most importantly, we initiated a thorough QT or tQT study to address questions raised by the FDA in the complete response letter that was issued in October 2010 regarding our BYDUREON new drug application. As we have previously discussed, the complete response letter requested a tQT study with exposures of exenatide higher than typical therapeutic levels of BYDUREON. In addition to the request for a tQT study, the letter requested the submission of the results of the DURATION-5 study to evaluate the efficacy and the labeling of the safety and effectiveness of the commercial formulation of BYDUREON. With enrollment in the tQT study proceeding as planned, we continue to expect to complete the study in time to submit our response to the agency in the second half of this year. In addition to initiating the tQT study during the first quarter, we also released top line results from two clinical trials, the DURATION-6 study and the Phase II study investigating a monthly dose suspension formulation of exenatide. With regards to DURATION-6, we were disappointed that the study didn't turn out as we had anticipated. And we are closely reviewing all aspects of the trial in an attempt to better understand the data.  That said, when looked across the entire duration program, the results we've seen with BYDUREON have been superlative, especially considering the fact that it is a therapy that is dosed only once a week.  Moving to exenatide once monthly, we recently reported top line results from a Phase II dose ranging study in which we tested the three doses of exenatide once monthly relative to weekly dose BYDUREON. After 20 weeks of treatment, patients who received just five injections of exenatide once monthly experienced average reductions in A1C ranging from 1.3 to 1.5 percentage points from baseline. This compares to a reduction of 1.5 percentage points seen in the BYDUREON treatment arm. Importantly, both exenatide once monthly and BYDUREON were well tolerated, with more than 90% of patients completing the study.  With these encouraging results in hand, we are proceeding with regulatory interactions that outline the next steps to the exenatide suspension program. As a noble formulation of exenatide that incorporates the same microspheres as BYDUREON, exenatide weekly and monthly suspension do not require reconstitution. Additionally, with monthly dosing, exenatide once monthly requires only 12 injections per year. By leveraging the potency of the exenatide molecule into a monthly dose formulation, we believe that we are developing a product candidate that represents an important component of the exenatide franchise and the next evolution of the GLP-1 market. As a pioneer in the development and commercialization of GLP-1 receptor agonist, we have amassed nearly 6 years of market experience with BYETTA, and one of the key takeaways from this experience has been recognizing the importance of convenience and tolerability with regard to driving uptake and maintaining persistence. At the end of the day, getting patients to initiate and remain on therapy is an important part of managing type 2 diabetes. And we believe that if approved, weekly or monthly dosed exenatide will represent attractive options for patients, payers and healthcare providers. As we work to complete the tQT study and advance the exenatide suspension program, we're also continuing our progress on several important life cycle initiatives for BYDUREON and the exenatide molecule. The development of a pen device for BYDUREON remains on track with an expected launch by the end of 2012 or in early 2013. We are continuing to add centers and enroll patients for our ongoing EXCEL cardiovascular outcomes study, which is investigating the potential for BYDUREON to reduce cardiovascular events relative to the standard of care in patients with type 2 diabetes. Also announced during the quarter was the voluntary suspension of an ongoing Phase II study examining the safety and effectiveness of pramlintide/metreleptin, our investigational combination therapy for the treatment of obesity. The study was suspended following the discovery of an antibody-related finding with metreleptin treatment in two patients who participated in a previously completed clinical study of obesity. At this time, we are working with Takeda to further understand this finding to determine the best path forward. Importantly, clinical studies related to our separate development program investigating the use of metreleptin in patients with rare forms of lipodystrophy remain ongoing. At the end of last year, we submitted the clinical and non-clinical sections of a Biologics License Application or BLA for the use of metreleptin to treat diabetes and/or hypertriglyceridemia in pediatric and adult patients with inherited or acquired lipodystrophy.  We plan to submit the chemistry, manufacturing and control sections and complete the BLA by the end of this year. Being fast track and priority our review designations, metreleptin could be available to lipodystrophy patients in the second half of 2012.  Supporting the clinical efficacy profile of metreleptin, data from a new analysis of an ongoing long-term study of metreleptin in patients with lipodystrophy conducted by investigators from the National Institutes of Health, represented just yesterday by our Senior Vice President and Head of Research and Development, Dr. Christian Weyer. The presentation of the 20th Annual Meeting and Clinical Congress at the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists in San Diego focused on the robust impact metreleptin has on the severe metabolic abnormalities that are associated with lipodystrophy.  Overall, these results reaffirm the potential of metreleptin as an important advance in the treatment of people living with this chronic and often debilitating metabolic disease. To round out my comments regarding our progress thus far this year, I'd like to reinforce the fact that while we continue to drive revenue from our marketed products and advance our key pipeline assets, we will continue to aggressively manage our expenses in line with our expected revenues.  As Mark will highlight momentarily, our strong first quarter financial results reflect the continued emphasis we are placing on controlling our spending and driving efficiencies across our business. I'll now turn things over to Mark to review our financial results released earlier today. Mark Foletta Thanks, Dan, and good morning. Today, we announced our financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2011. As Dan mentioned, and we have discussed in previous calls, we are managing the business with operational discipline and are focused on generating sustainable positive operating cash flow and maintaining a strong cash position.  Our measure of operating cash flow is non-GAAP operating loss, which approximates our cash flow from operations before working capital changes. Non-GAAP operating loss is defined as our GAAP operating loss adjusted for non-cash items including equity compensation, depreciation and amortization and any other unusual items such as restructuring charges.  In the first quarter, non-GAAP operating loss was $3.2 million, an improvement from a loss of $3.8 million in the first quarter of 2010. Total revenues in the first quarter were $152.7 million, a 12% decrease compared to $174.1 million in the first quarter of 2010. Our gross margins remain strong at 92%. Our operating expenses were $106.5 million in the first quarter, consisting of $64.6 million of selling, general and administrative expenses and $41.9 million of research and development expenses. This represents an overall $12 million or 10% reduction from $118.5 million of expenses in the same quarter of last year. This decrease reflects our continued focus on driving efficiencies across our business. For further details regarding our financial results reported today, please refer to the presentation available in the Investor section of our company website.  I'd like to make a few additional comments comparing the first quarter of 2011 sequentially to the fourth quarter of 2010. BYETTA sales were down $8.4 million sequentially or 6.2%, which is comparable to the percentage decline in prescriptions during this period. As expected, following the discontinuation of the vial at the end of last year, SYMLIN sales were down $3.1 million or 11.8% sequentially. Encouragingly, sales of the SymlinPen increased 14%, sequentially. Wholesaler inventories at March 31 were comparable to those at December 31, and we believe are consistent with patient demand. In a moment, Vince will speak in more detail regarding our commercial activities. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $3.2 million for the first quarter compared to non-GAAP operating income of $22.9 million in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter results were positively impacted by the recognition of the $10 million milestone for the launch of BYETTA in Japan and the impact of our decision to forego a corporate bonus, which benefited the fourth quarter of 2010 by $15 million. Excluding the positive impact of these onetime events, our quarter-over-quarter results were comparable and consistent with our approach to manage expenses in line with revenues. While we will continue to drive efficiencies in our business and manage our spending in line with expected revenues, our current operating model anticipates and requires the launch of BYDUREON in the United States to deliver our stated goal of sustainable, positive cash flow growth.  We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with $475 million in cash, short-term investments and restricted cash. I'll point out that that is a $17 million increase from the end of 2010. While this improvement includes the receipt of a $10 million milestone from Lilly for the Japan launch of BYETTA and favorable working capital changes, it also reflects our commitment to continue to tightly manage the use of cash in our business. On April 15, 2011, our $200 million of 2.5% convertible senior notes matured. Adjusted for this debt maturity, our pro forma cash, investments and restricted cash balance at March 31, 2011, was $275 million. To help strengthen our cash balance, we have noticed Eli Lilly of our intent to draw the $165 million line of credit that was made available to us as part of the product supply agreement we entered into October of 2009. If drawn, proceeds from this facility can be used for general corporate purposes and would be due in the second quarter of 2014. As a reminder, we will pay an interest rate of 5.25% plus the 5-day average 3-month LIBOR, which effectively, is an all-in interest rate of approximately 5.5%. And there are no prepayment penalties. I'd now like to provide an update regarding key trends and assumptions for the remainder of 2011. Entering 2011, we guided that the normalized run rate for our quarterly GAAP operating expenses was between $110 million and $115 million and at this level would decline during the year. Our spending was below this range in the first quarter but variability in our quarterly operating expenses is expected. We will continue to drive efficiencies across the organization. Non-GAAP operating results continue to be the key metric we will use to measure our financial performance. We now expect a non-GAAP operating loss at the low end of our previous range of $25 million to $40 million. We expect to earn a $15 million milestone upon the launch of BYDUREON in the European Union.  At the end of the first quarter, the cumulative gross margin threshold for sales of exenatide outside the United States was crossed, and we will begin to record royalties in the second quarter this year. These royalties, based on the gross profits outside the U.S., are tiered, and we continue to expect that the total amount earned in 2011 will be less than $5 million. We remain confident that we will be able to maintain strong combined gross margins for BYETTA and SYMLIN of at least 90%. We also continue to expect net interest expense to be $25 million to $30 million. Non-cash adjustments including depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation are expected to be at the high end of our previous range of $80 million to $90 million in 2011. As I mentioned earlier, we have repaid the $200 million convertible note that is due this month, and noticed Lilly of our intent to draw the $165 million credit facility.  To summarize, our first quarter results are a direct result of our ongoing efforts to closely manage expenses. This discipline will continue to be a top priority throughout the year as we strive to achieve additional efficiencies in our business and preserve cash. As we look to the future, we will opportunistically manage our financial risk with a focus on maximizing shareholder value.  Now I will turn the call over to Vince to review our commercial activities. Vincent Mihalik Thank you, Mark. Before I comment on the performance of our marketed products, I'd like to note that as we work to complete the tQT study with exenatide, we are continuing to enroll patients in centers with the EXCEL cardiovascular outcome study and are actively engaged in market development activities to support the successful launch of BYDUREON. With the power of continuous control in just one weekly dose, we firmly believe that BYDUREON is a product that represents an opportunity to revolutionize the way patients and physicians manage their type 2 diabetes. So let's now move on to discuss the BYETTA performance. BYETTA sales decreased approximately 6.2% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in sales was generally in line with a decline in total prescriptions of 6.6%. Although BYETTA prescriptions declined quarter-over-quarter, we're continuing to observe positive dynamics for the GLP-1 share of the diabetes market during the first quarter.  Since the launch of the second daily dose GLP-1 receptor agonist nearly a year ago, 4-week moving averages indicate that the total weekly prescriptions for GLP-1 receptor agonists have grown by approximately 32%. We believe that the steady GLP-1 class growth observed in the U.S. is a clear sign that the market is willing to adopt new entrants into this important class of therapies, a sign that bodes well for the launch of BYDUREON.  While the GLP-1 class growth has been encouraging, we believe the class has enormous potential to continue its growth. As such, the core focus of our sales and marketing organization is on driving additional adoption of BYETTA by both patients and physicians who have not yet experienced the benefits of GLP-1 therapy.  In support of these efforts, we intend to expand the indication for BYETTA later this year, having submitted a supplementary new drug application for the use of BYETTA with basal insulin in late 2010, we're expecting regulatory action before the end of the year. Based on the data we've seen to date, we are very excited to have the opportunity to make BYETTA available to millions of insulin-using type 2 diabetes patients in the United States. With the potential to provide outstanding post-meal glucose control and help insulin-using patients achieve lower fasting plasma glucose levels and improve hemoglobin A1C relative to patients using insulin alone, we believe that this potential new indication for BYETTA could provide a compelling addition to the choices available to both patients and physicians.  Along with the well-established safety and efficacy profile of BYETTA and a heritage established by more than 5 years of market presence, our managed markets team has achieved broad access with managed care plans. Maintaining strong managed care access is a key strategic advantage, and we continue to maintain greater than 80% tier 2 access.  Additionally, I'd like to congratulate our managed markets team for being selected by the Health Industries Research Center as the team with the best account managers in a small company category for the second year in a row. Our ability to deliver favorable managed care coverage remains a priority and having a top brained team in place will allow us to maintain strong access for patients using our therapies. Simply put, for patients, providers and payers, BYETTA has a proven and sustained A1C control powerful postprandial and fasting blood glucose reductions, potential for improved beta-cell function, a low risk of hypoglycemia, strong patient support programs and broad managed care access. Now let's move on to SYMLIN, the first and only FDA-approved Amylin analog. As a reminder, SYMLIN is our fully-owned compound that addresses unmet needs for patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, who use mealtime insulin. SYMLIN reduces blood glucose fluctuations and improves glucose control, often with weight loss.  The first quarter of 2011 was a transition quarter for SYMLIN after more than 5 years of manufacturing and promoting SYMLIN in a vial and syringe presentation, and 3 years in the SymlinPen. We transitioned to a pen-only presentation in January of this year. The SymlinPen now represents approximately 93% of the prescriptions for SYMLIN.  SYMLIN revenues decreased by approximately 11.8% during the quarter. The decrease was in line with expectations following the end of our manufacturing and promotion of the vial presentation of SYMLIN, which represented approximately 30% of the 2010 SYMLIN revenue. Until the inventory of vials that remains in the distributions channel has been completed, we expect to continue to see some variability in prescription trends.  Let me close my portion of the remarks by saying that we continue to build momentum and enthusiasm and are focused on driving BYETTA and SYMLIN sales.  I'll now turn the call back over to Dan for a few additional thoughts. Dan Bradbury Thanks, Vince. Before the close of our prepared remarks, I'll just add a few more comments. As we entered the second quarter of 2011, I would like to quickly preview our presence at the American Diabetes Association Scientific Meeting that would be held June 24 through June 28 right here in San Diego. Once again, we are planning to have a significant scientific and commercial presence at that meeting. I am pleased to announce that we have had more than 20 abstracts accepted at the meeting, with additional studies submitted as late breakers. A preliminary list of our abstracts and other activities at ADA will be posted to our corporate website when available. Additionally, the webcast of our annual investor reception at the ADA will take place on Sunday, June 26, at 7:30 p.m. Pacific Time. We look forward to seeing many of you in San Diego as we review meeting highlights and take questions. I'm also pleased to note that we will be holding our 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Tuesday, May 24, at 9 a.m. Pacific Time here in San Diego. For those stockholders who aren't able to attend the meeting in person, we invite them to listen to the webcast of the meeting, followed by a corporate overview. We look forward to this opportunity to provide additional updates about Amylin and meet with our stockholders in person. In closing, I'd like to reiterate that I, along with the Amylin leadership team, remain committed to creating value for our shareholders, our employees and most importantly, the millions of diabetes patients we are focused on serving. Additionally, like to thank each and every one of the Amylin employees for their dedication and commitment to this focus.  I'll now ask the operator to open the lines for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joshua Schimmer with Leerink Swann. Joshua Schimmer - Leerink Swann LLC Thanks for taking the questions. First, on the once a month exenatide, do you have any expectations what that regulatory path might look like for what you're going to propose? Dan Bradbury The big advantage that we have with the suspension program, both the weekly and the monthly, is that they will both be line extensions of BYETTA which, of course, having been in the market now for six years, we'll be able to reference that data set. Our expectation is that it would be similar to BYDUREON and that it'd be a 505(b)(1) application. And as such, would leverage all the data sets that we have on both BYETTA and BYDUREON as part of that application. Joshua Schimmer - Leerink Swann LLC Great. Does that mean that a single Phase III study would suffice or do you expect it will require more? Dan Bradbury Well, if that's the case, Josh, that will be consistent with the guidance that the FDA gave us for BYDUREON. As you know, the regulatory parts of BYDUREON hasn't been as straightforward as that. So we are currently planning to have a discussion with the agency before confirming the regulatory path forward. Joshua Schimmer - Leerink Swann LLC Great. And then on BYETTA under the doughnut hole and the co-funding requirement, did you see any impact on this? When do you expect this impact to be greatest, and are you able to now quantify the impact that the doughnut hole will have, at least, in terms of on the cost side and covering half the patients? Dan Bradbury Yes. Okay. That's a great question. I'm going to ask Vince to comment on that, Josh. Vincent Mihalik Yes, Josh, thanks for the question. Actually, we've been expanding the, I'd say, the access we have in Medicare Part D. And as a result, we had a very small exposure initially to the Healthcare Reform Act, and the doughnut hole did have some -- it usually does have some impact in the first quarter of every year. We do usually see a bump back up. This particular quarter, the diabetes market was relatively flat. We didn't see much of an expansion in the overall market. We're continuing to assess our risk, however, under the Healthcare Reform Act. It has had some minor implications for us to date, and we've included those in our financials. But overall, our exposure is not that broad. Joshua Schimmer - Leerink Swann LLC Okay. Thanks very much. Operator Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group. Omar Rifat This is Omar filling in for Mark. Just wanted to start out by asking very quickly BYDUREON's ex-U.S. launch price, can we get a sense of that? Dan Bradbury Well, until we get actually approval in Europe, I don't expect that we'll be providing any guidance with regards to the European launch price. I should say also, that is the responsibility of Eli Lilly and Company since they're responsible for all commercialization of exenatide products outside the United States. Omar Rifat Sure. And then a quick follow up, is it reasonable to expect detailed DURATION-6 data at ADA? Dan Bradbury No, I don't think it is. The reason I say that is that we are still undertaking an investigation of the DURATION-6 study, and I doubt that that will completed and certainly not available in time for submission, even as a late breaker to the ADA. Omar Rifat Great. And then just a final quick one, possibly for Mark, going towards the end of the year, I noticed consensus expectations are that the expenses may roughly stay flat. Just wanted to get a sense of how the SG&A spend, especially, might ramp-up as we head closer to a possible resubmission of BYDUREON and the possible launch next year? Dan Bradbury Yes, sure. Mark? Mark Foletta Yes, thanks, Omar, for the question. I think it's fair to say, we've been working on our operating model intensely over the last several years as you know. And we guided that we entered the quarter with operating expenses of -- entered the year with operating expenses of $110 million to $115 million. We actually came in below that range in the first quarter at about $106.5 million. We expect some variability there moving forward. But the operating model is in place to launch BYDUREON. And I think that's the important answer to your question. We don't anticipate significant changes other than customary launch-related expenses to launch BYDUREON. Omar Rifat Great. Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG Thanks for taking my question. So, Omar has stolen my questions but, I guess, one of my key questions is, have you got any sense now from talking with Lilly regarding why DURATION-6 might have come out the way it did? Any other nuances that you've noticed when you've taken a closer look at the data? Dan Bradbury I'm afraid you're going to have talk to Omar regarding his questions. But to answer your question directly, no. At this point, really, we can't provide any guidance. We're really at the -- still very much at the beginning of the investigation into the outcome of DURATION-6. I mean, that having been said, we do expect that we will complete that this year, and that the results we'll be able to report at the scientific meeting in the future. Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG Great. And then I guess my next question is regarding the EU market. Can you help us think a little bit through how you see that market shaping up for the GLP class? Dan Bradbury Yes, certainly, Robyn. I'm going to ask Vince to answer that question for you. Vincent Mihalik Thanks, Robyn. Robyn, obviously, we're seeing very good growth and adoption in Europe relative to the GLP-1 class. And, in fact, the market has gone up about 83% since the launch of both GLP-1 receptors agonists in the European marketplace. And so I think the overall adoption of the GLP-1 class and especially the response to the second GLP-1 receptor agonist, certainly bodes well, I think, for BYDUREON with its continuous control with once-week dosing. Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG And I guess lastly, the overall growth of the market, as far as the GLP class in the United States, and I know as of the last 2 or 3 quarters ago -- 3 months ago, that the GLP class sort of stalled and grown and then stalled. Any update on the overall growth of the GLP market as far as percentage of Asians with diabetes patients on GLPs? Vincent Mihalik In fact, Robyn, we are seeing about a 30% growth in volumes since about a year ago, and about 25% share growth in the diabetes class since about a year ago. And when you talk to physicians, particularly endocrinologists, most of them, 3 out of 4, say they are going to increase their use of GLP-1s in the future. So I think it bodes well for the continued growth of the GLP-1 class. And keep in mind that greater than 70% of all the scripts are coming from PCP. So, all in all, I think we're going to continue to see this class grow over time. Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG Okay, well, thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya, Piper Jaffray. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies Thanks. Just a couple of questions. First, on the DURATION-6, Dan, maybe you could just talk to what type of analysis you're doing with the trial? What questions you're trying to get answered? And then I just had a follow up on the European approval. Dan Bradbury Yes, sure. For DURATION-6, I think it's really looking at the overall conduct of the study. This study was conducted in 19 different countries. There was multiple sites in many of those countries. And -- sorry, about 120 sites, apparently, overall. And so, it's really looking at the conduct of those sites and making sure that it's been completed. The study was completed appropriately. I think also looking and making sure that there are no issues with regards to drug supply in terms of how the drug was supplied and the storage of drug, et cetera, during the conduct of the study. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies Is there any early evidence that there might have been a geographic bias or issues in certain... Dan Bradbury Well, I think just to say that we were surprised with the outcome of the study. It wasn't what we expected, clearly, from a BYDUREON standpoint. Having completed 5 other studies and each of those studies having got greater A1C reductions than we saw in DURATION-6, I think it's reasonable for us to investigate the conduct of the study. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies Okay. And just on the European, the CHMP review or recommendations for approval, what is their view of the drug's effect on QT? How does that differ from the U.S.? And I don't know if there was any additional data that was submitted to the EMEA, which maybe wasn't submitted to the FDA? Dan Bradbury There was no additional data submitted to the EMEA that was not submitted to the FDA. That would not be a good thing to do. And just to say that as far as we're aware, at this point, the prescribing information does not include any additional comment on QT. We have to wait for the final label. We haven't received that yet, of course, because what we've received so far is the CPMP recommendation for approval and not the final approval in Europe, which we'd expect to receive within 2 to 3 months. Operator Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citi. Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc Thanks for taking my question. So I just had 2 or 3 questions, the first one actually is metreleptin. The data continues to look very, very good. As we all know, these markets are not very big, and you guys did not conduct any sort of prospective studies. Most of the data that's been presented and been published, as you mentioned, is from the NIH. Can you give us a little bit of a sense how much buy in do you have from FDA at this point to file and ultimately get approved, and how do you think about this opportunity? And then I had a follow up. Dan Bradbury Sure. Well, Yaron, thanks for the question. And you're actually right. I mean, the data continues to look very, very positive with regards to the benefits of metreleptin in patients with these rare forms of lipodystrophy that we're treating. In terms of buy in from the FDA, we have orphan drug designation. We've got that prior to the submission of the first part of the BLA that went in at the end of last year. That was the clinical and non-clinical sections. And obviously, before we submitted that, we reviewed with the agency the data that we had. And we were informed that, that would be adequate for review. So in terms of -- I think, we have about as much as buy in as could be expected from the agency prior to completion of the review. Our intention is to complete the application later this year by submitting the chemistry, manufacturing and controls section of the BLA by the end of this year. And we do expect that we will submit at that point for priority review. And if that's granted, then there's the potential for us to gain approval by the second half of 2012. The way we think of it is, at this time, we're still, I think, finalizing our commercialization plans. You're absolutely right. It's not a very significant number of people. When you look globally, it's probably less than 3,000 people here in the United States, somewhere in the region of around 1,000 to 1,200 patients is probably what we're looking at. We're actually, at this point, undertaking some epidemiology work to get a good idea or a better idea, I should say, of the exact opportunity. But I think it's fair to say that this is very much an ultra orphan product. And as such, we'd be looking to commercialize it in a similar manner to drugs of that nature that have been commercialized in the past. Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc That's really useful. And then just for ADA, are there any plans to present any QTC data on BYDUREON? Dan Bradbury So the specifics of our ADA abstracts, we haven't released yet. But I think you could be assured that we will have our usual investor meeting at the ADA and expect that there will be a full review of appropriate data at that meeting. Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc Okay, great. Thanks, Dan. Operator Our next question comes from Catherine Arnold with Credit Suisse. Catherine Arnold - Crédit Suisse AG Thanks. I wanted to ask you about cash flow, and I also wanted to ask you about monthly BYDUREON. So maybe I'll throw the cash flow questions and we can come back to the monthly BYDUREON. So on cash flow, I was wondering if you could talk about the possibility for refinancing your converts, and how you're thinking about that with 2014, obviously, being a big year for that obligation. And I'm also wondering on cash flow presenting opportunities to improve working capital so that you can help your cash flow position in the next 3 to 5 years. Dan Bradbury Thanks, Catherine. I'll ask Mark to take that. Mark Foletta Yes. Thanks, Catherine, I appreciate the question. As we said in the prepared remarks, we did pay off the $200 million convertible debenture last Friday. We thought that, that was the most appropriate thing in the interest of shareholder value to do that at this time. Obviously, we have a number of milestones coming forward to be able to opportunistically address the debt, the 2014 debt, including the potential drawing of the Lilly loan. We've worked very hard, as you know, on our operating model over the last couple of years to manage expenses in line with revenues. And as we said in the prepared remarks, the opportunity for significant cash flow growth comes with the launch of BYDUREON. Certainly encouraged now that we have the first step in motion to get the product, to make the product available to patients in Europe. And that will certainly begin to provide us some financial rewards and the leverage that we will need to drive margins for that product moving forward. We've made significant investments and as you know in a plant, including a pen line. So we're set up very well to take advantage of the launch of BYDUREON globally. And as I said, we've got some time before the maturities that you've referred to, and we'll certainly look to opportunistically finance those in the future with the interest of maximizing shareholder value. In terms of your question on working capital, I want to make sure I'm clear on the question. Could you repeat it? Catherine Arnold - Crédit Suisse AG Yes. I just wondered if there's an opportunity to change some of your metrics on working capital, whether it's accounts receivable or inventory, where you might have a chance to start to bring some of those numbers down to maximize your cash flow? Mark Foletta Yes, well, that's been a focus. Our receivables turn very, very quickly. I mean in this industry, you get paid very fast on your receivables. So that's not really an issue for us. In terms of inventory, we do have some inventory on the balance sheet, in terms of API for both of our products. Much of that is tied to BYDUREON because we've built some inventory in advance. So I think you would look to see those metrics approved as we go forward again, tied to the launch of BYDUREON. Catherine Arnold - Crédit Suisse AG Great. And I wanted to ask you about the monthly BYDUREON. Could you talk about PK? There is some variability, obviously, in a once weekly BYDUREON versus BYETTA. And I am just wondering how we should be thinking about what PK variability exists with that product. And also not from a regulatory perspective and requirements, but would you see yourselves for competitive reasons doing a duration-like program on a monthly? Dan Bradbury Yes, I think in terms of PK, we will be presenting data on the program at a future scientific meeting. But I would remind you that the formulation that we're using is the same formulation that was used in BYDUREON. And that formulation was actually initially designed to be a monthly product. So we don't expect to see very substantial increases in variability from a PK standpoint. There will be some because you reduced your dosing frequency. But we don't expect, in fact, we have not seen very significant increases in PK variability. In terms of your second part of your question regarding doing a DURATION-like program, I think once we get guidance from regulatory authorities with regards to what the appropriate program would be for approval, we'll then make further decisions with regards to whether or not any additional studies would be warranted for the monthly program. Catherine Arnold - Crédit Suisse AG Thanks very much. Operator Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMC. Matthew Lowe - JP Morgan Chase & Co This is actually Matt Lowe in for Cory today. Many of my questions have been answered. But if I could just kind of revisit the European market for BYDUREON. Just wondering if you're expecting any kind of significant differences in that market versus what we might see in the U.S., and if you could also just speak to the commercial impacts of DURATION-6? Thanks. Dan Bradbury Thanks to your question. I'm going to ask Vince to answer both those questions regarding Europe and also the impact of DURATION-6. So, Vince? Vincent Mihalik Yes. Thanks, Dan. On the European market, obviously, as I was commenting earlier, we are seeing really good growth in adoption for GLP-1s in the European market. Of course, it varies by country and also varies by the reimbursement system. But for the most part, we are seeing major expansion, literally, more than doubling of the GLP-1 market in each of those countries. So with the launch of a second GLP-1 receptor agonist more, I would say, voices in the market, we're beginning to see greater expansion in the diabetes market of the GLP-1 class across all of Europe. So I think that bodes well for BYDUREON's presence in the European market. As it relates to the DURATION-6 and again, Dan made this comment that when you look across all of the DURATION series, and we look at A1C reductions across a wide range of patients with multiple different therapy backgrounds, we were really surprised at the results. If I take that forward, however, keep in mind that this is a very small difference statistically, so to speak, in hemoglobin A1C but not a very big difference clinically. And most physicians do weigh a number of variables in choosing what medication they're going to provide for patients. They look at efficacy. They look at safety. They look at tolerability. They look at convenience. They look at adherence, and they look at access. And all those things play together before they decide what particular medication they're going to give a patient. And if I again look at DURATION-6, BYDUREON demonstrated outstanding tolerability and, again, continuous control, glucose control, with a once weekly dose. So I think when physicians look across the entire range of DURATION-6 studies, when they look at the advantage of continuous control with once weekly dosing, the great tolerability potential for weight loss, its comparison to other most frequently prescribed anti-diabetes medications, I think it bodes very well for BYDUREON's competitiveness. Matthew Lowe - JP Morgan Chase & Co Yes, okay. That's great. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch Thank you. So relative to the sales of BYETTA, the collaborative profit sharing seemed a little bit higher than expected. I appreciate your efforts at lowering SG&A, but is there anything to a potential offset of your efforts by increased selling expense by Lilly and you have to true that up in that line item? Mark Foletta Steve, the collaborative profit sharing is 50% of the gross margin of BYETTA. I don't think it's out of line from any other quarter. So I'm not sure if I'm clear on your question. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch But if you're selling expense differs materially from Lilly's, isn't there a true-up in that line item? Mark Foletta No, we true that up right through the SG&A line item, so any true-up there... Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch That's in your SG&A. That true-up is in your SG&A? Mark Foletta Yes. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch So your gross margins on BYETTA are greater than they are in SYMLIN? Mark Foletta Yes. We're over 90% on BYETTA and so you should think of a collaborative profit-sharing line as pretty pure as 50% of the U.S. gross margin. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch And then I have a question on the once monthly for Vince. In your market research, do you see that the potential driver for this product being attracting those patients that are already GLP-1 patients? Or do you see that the once monthly could meaningfully pull in patients that are using other anti-diabetic therapies? Vincent Mihalik Thanks, Steve, for the question. And yes, I think you could say yes to both parts of that question. I think you're going to see patients who have started on GLP-1s. We have already good compliance and good adherence; want to move to a once monthly given their experiences and the ease and convenience of once-month dosing. And I think as well physicians may look at patients who are out of control, who have difficulty with adherence moving to once a month dosing because of its convenience and adherence. So I think you could say yes to both sides of that equation. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch Okay, thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Tom Russo with Baird. Thomas Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated Just putting some of the same topics, for DURATION-6, is part of the analysis and do you have any sense yet of when patients reached steady-state versus the six-month measurement of A1C? And did you continue any patients out beyond six-months in that study? Dan Bradbury No. In terms of DURATION-6, we actually don't have any analysis at this time that I can comment on. But also, there was no extension to this study. So we don't have any information for patients who went beyond that six months period. Thomas Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated Okay. And then on the once monthly, can you give any additional color on which dose had the 1.5% reduction in A1C and also can you say anything about weight loss versus BYDUREON in that study? Dan Bradbury Just to say that, well, we haven't the given any specifics with regards to the dosing information. That will be presented at a future scientific meeting. We're also, at this point, completing our work to make the final dose selection and that has not been made at this time. With regards to weight loss, I would just say that weight loss was consistent with that seen in previous studies with BYDUREON. Thomas Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated Okay. And last question, I think, maybe for Mark, the economics to Amylin from BYDUREON in Europe, I think you might have said in the past where the royalties start and can you also give any color, and can you confirm kind of where the royalties start and then whether the first step up in the tier is above or below the current run rate for BYETTA in Europe? Mark Foletta Yes, Tom. Thanks for the question. Yes, we did guide that this year, we expect to get -- we crossed the threshold actually right as we exited the quarter and we'll expect to begin to earn royalties relative to BYETTA in the O.U.S. market. With the BYDUREON launch, obviously, we'd expect revenue growth. But I think it's important to remind you the discussion we've had in the past about the gross margin transition for BYDUREON. This royalty is pegged to gross margin, and it is tiered. And we are currently -- as we move in the second half of the year, be in a kind of low- to mid-single digit percentage of gross margins or of royalty on gross margin. And we would expect a few years, Tom, to be able to drive the leverage within the margin line to be able to drive to the next tier. So I think, as you think of your models, obviously, it's very early in terms of thinking of a revenue line for O.U.S. But we would guide you to be conservative in terms of thinking of our margins over the next few years as we drive the leverage at the gross margin line with our plant in Ohio. Thomas Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated Okay. Thanks, Mark. Operator Our last question comes from John Sonnier with William Blair. John Sonnier - William Blair & Company L.L.C. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one on once monthly. I'm wondering, Dan, I guess, if the super therapeutic concentrations of exenatide that you've used in the tQT study exceed the concentrations of exenatide injected once monthly or if it's possibly you're going to have to push the dose or do a separate tQT trial for once monthly? Dan Bradbury Thanks, John. Nice to hear your voice. Just to say that we expect that the tQT study that's being conducted now would be adequate with regards to providing any assurances with regards to any effect on exenatide on QT prolongation or not. This case, as we don't believe will be the case for exenatide once monthly. The plasma concentrations that we expect to see with monthly are subject to the dose that we would select for that product. But even in the case of patients who would have some forms of renal impairment, we would expect that the data that we would generate from the ongoing tQT study would be adequate for us to be able to model what would be expected for those patients from that study. So our expectation is that the tQT study that's ongoing would be adequate for any submission for a monthly program. John Sonnier - William Blair & Company L.L.C. That's helpful. Thanks so much. Operator That does conclude the Q&A. Dan Bradbury Thanks very much, everybody. Again, thanks for your interest and for your questions today. We have a huge opportunity as a company to continue to advance our mission of discovering and developing and commercializing medicines to improve the lives of patients. Additionally, our leadership team and the many dedicated employees of Amylin remain focused both on building the business today and laying the necessary foundation for our success tomorrow.

Dan Bradbury Yes. Okay. That's a great question. I'm going to ask Vince to comment on that, Josh. Vincent Mihalik Yes, Josh, thanks for the question. Actually, we've been expanding the, I'd say, the access we have in Medicare Part D. And as a result, we had a very small exposure initially to the Healthcare Reform Act, and the doughnut hole did have some -- it usually does have some impact in the first quarter of every year. We do usually see a bump back up. This particular quarter, the diabetes market was relatively flat. We didn't see much of an expansion in the overall market. We're continuing to assess our risk, however, under the Healthcare Reform Act. It has had some minor implications for us to date, and we've included those in our financials. But overall, our exposure is not that broad. Joshua Schimmer - Leerink Swann LLC Okay. Thanks very much. Operator Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group. Omar Rifat This is Omar filling in for Mark. Just wanted to start out by asking very quickly BYDUREON's ex-U.S. launch price, can we get a sense of that? Dan Bradbury Well, until we get actually approval in Europe, I don't expect that we'll be providing any guidance with regards to the European launch price. I should say also, that is the responsibility of Eli Lilly and Company since they're responsible for all commercialization of exenatide products outside the United States. Omar Rifat Sure. And then a quick follow up, is it reasonable to expect detailed DURATION-6 data at ADA? Dan Bradbury No, I don't think it is. The reason I say that is that we are still undertaking an investigation of the DURATION-6 study, and I doubt that that will completed and certainly not available in time for submission, even as a late breaker to the ADA. Omar Rifat Great. And then just a final quick one, possibly for Mark, going towards the end of the year, I noticed consensus expectations are that the expenses may roughly stay flat. Just wanted to get a sense of how the SG&A spend, especially, might ramp-up as we head closer to a possible resubmission of BYDUREON and the possible launch next year? Dan Bradbury Yes, sure. Mark? Mark Foletta Yes, thanks, Omar, for the question. I think it's fair to say, we've been working on our operating model intensely over the last several years as you know. And we guided that we entered the quarter with operating expenses of -- entered the year with operating expenses of $110 million to $115 million. We actually came in below that range in the first quarter at about $106.5 million. We expect some variability there moving forward. But the operating model is in place to launch BYDUREON. And I think that's the important answer to your question. We don't anticipate significant changes other than customary launch-related expenses to launch BYDUREON. Omar Rifat Great. Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG Thanks for taking my question. So, Omar has stolen my questions but, I guess, one of my key questions is, have you got any sense now from talking with Lilly regarding why DURATION-6 might have come out the way it did? Any other nuances that you've noticed when you've taken a closer look at the data? Dan Bradbury I'm afraid you're going to have talk to Omar regarding his questions. But to answer your question directly, no. At this point, really, we can't provide any guidance. We're really at the -- still very much at the beginning of the investigation into the outcome of DURATION-6. I mean, that having been said, we do expect that we will complete that this year, and that the results we'll be able to report at the scientific meeting in the future. Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG Great. And then I guess my next question is regarding the EU market. Can you help us think a little bit through how you see that market shaping up for the GLP class? Dan Bradbury Yes, certainly, Robyn. I'm going to ask Vince to answer that question for you. Vincent Mihalik Thanks, Robyn. Robyn, obviously, we're seeing very good growth and adoption in Europe relative to the GLP-1 class. And, in fact, the market has gone up about 83% since the launch of both GLP-1 receptors agonists in the European marketplace. And so I think the overall adoption of the GLP-1 class and especially the response to the second GLP-1 receptor agonist, certainly bodes well, I think, for BYDUREON with its continuous control with once-week dosing. Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG And I guess lastly, the overall growth of the market, as far as the GLP class in the United States, and I know as of the last 2 or 3 quarters ago -- 3 months ago, that the GLP class sort of stalled and grown and then stalled. Any update on the overall growth of the GLP market as far as percentage of Asians with diabetes patients on GLPs? Vincent Mihalik In fact, Robyn, we are seeing about a 30% growth in volumes since about a year ago, and about 25% share growth in the diabetes class since about a year ago. And when you talk to physicians, particularly endocrinologists, most of them, 3 out of 4, say they are going to increase their use of GLP-1s in the future. So I think it bodes well for the continued growth of the GLP-1 class. And keep in mind that greater than 70% of all the scripts are coming from PCP. So, all in all, I think we're going to continue to see this class grow over time. Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG Okay, well, thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya, Piper Jaffray. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies Thanks. Just a couple of questions. First, on the DURATION-6, Dan, maybe you could just talk to what type of analysis you're doing with the trial? What questions you're trying to get answered? And then I just had a follow up on the European approval. Dan Bradbury Yes, sure. For DURATION-6, I think it's really looking at the overall conduct of the study. This study was conducted in 19 different countries. There was multiple sites in many of those countries. And -- sorry, about 120 sites, apparently, overall. And so, it's really looking at the conduct of those sites and making sure that it's been completed. The study was completed appropriately. I think also looking and making sure that there are no issues with regards to drug supply in terms of how the drug was supplied and the storage of drug, et cetera, during the conduct of the study. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies Is there any early evidence that there might have been a geographic bias or issues in certain... Dan Bradbury Well, I think just to say that we were surprised with the outcome of the study. It wasn't what we expected, clearly, from a BYDUREON standpoint. Having completed 5 other studies and each of those studies having got greater A1C reductions than we saw in DURATION-6, I think it's reasonable for us to investigate the conduct of the study. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies Okay. And just on the European, the CHMP review or recommendations for approval, what is their view of the drug's effect on QT? How does that differ from the U.S.? And I don't know if there was any additional data that was submitted to the EMEA, which maybe wasn't submitted to the FDA? Dan Bradbury There was no additional data submitted to the EMEA that was not submitted to the FDA. That would not be a good thing to do. And just to say that as far as we're aware, at this point, the prescribing information does not include any additional comment on QT. We have to wait for the final label. We haven't received that yet, of course, because what we've received so far is the CPMP recommendation for approval and not the final approval in Europe, which we'd expect to receive within 2 to 3 months. Operator Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citi. Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc Thanks for taking my question. So I just had 2 or 3 questions, the first one actually is metreleptin. The data continues to look very, very good. As we all know, these markets are not very big, and you guys did not conduct any sort of prospective studies. Most of the data that's been presented and been published, as you mentioned, is from the NIH. Can you give us a little bit of a sense how much buy in do you have from FDA at this point to file and ultimately get approved, and how do you think about this opportunity? And then I had a follow up. Dan Bradbury Sure. Well, Yaron, thanks for the question. And you're actually right. I mean, the data continues to look very, very positive with regards to the benefits of metreleptin in patients with these rare forms of lipodystrophy that we're treating. In terms of buy in from the FDA, we have orphan drug designation. We've got that prior to the submission of the first part of the BLA that went in at the end of last year. That was the clinical and non-clinical sections. And obviously, before we submitted that, we reviewed with the agency the data that we had. And we were informed that, that would be adequate for review. So in terms of -- I think, we have about as much as buy in as could be expected from the agency prior to completion of the review. Our intention is to complete the application later this year by submitting the chemistry, manufacturing and controls section of the BLA by the end of this year. And we do expect that we will submit at that point for priority review. And if that's granted, then there's the potential for us to gain approval by the second half of 2012. The way we think of it is, at this time, we're still, I think, finalizing our commercialization plans. You're absolutely right. It's not a very significant number of people. When you look globally, it's probably less than 3,000 people here in the United States, somewhere in the region of around 1,000 to 1,200 patients is probably what we're looking at. We're actually, at this point, undertaking some epidemiology work to get a good idea or a better idea, I should say, of the exact opportunity. But I think it's fair to say that this is very much an ultra orphan product. And as such, we'd be looking to commercialize it in a similar manner to drugs of that nature that have been commercialized in the past. Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc That's really useful. And then just for ADA, are there any plans to present any QTC data on BYDUREON? Dan Bradbury So the specifics of our ADA abstracts, we haven't released yet. But I think you could be assured that we will have our usual investor meeting at the ADA and expect that there will be a full review of appropriate data at that meeting. Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc Okay, great. Thanks, Dan. Operator Our next question comes from Catherine Arnold with Credit Suisse. Catherine Arnold - Crédit Suisse AG Thanks. I wanted to ask you about cash flow, and I also wanted to ask you about monthly BYDUREON. So maybe I'll throw the cash flow questions and we can come back to the monthly BYDUREON. So on cash flow, I was wondering if you could talk about the possibility for refinancing your converts, and how you're thinking about that with 2014, obviously, being a big year for that obligation. And I'm also wondering on cash flow presenting opportunities to improve working capital so that you can help your cash flow position in the next 3 to 5 years. Dan Bradbury Thanks, Catherine. I'll ask Mark to take that. Mark Foletta Yes. Thanks, Catherine, I appreciate the question. As we said in the prepared remarks, we did pay off the $200 million convertible debenture last Friday. We thought that, that was the most appropriate thing in the interest of shareholder value to do that at this time. Obviously, we have a number of milestones coming forward to be able to opportunistically address the debt, the 2014 debt, including the potential drawing of the Lilly loan. We've worked very hard, as you know, on our operating model over the last couple of years to manage expenses in line with revenues. And as we said in the prepared remarks, the opportunity for significant cash flow growth comes with the launch of BYDUREON. Certainly encouraged now that we have the first step in motion to get the product, to make the product available to patients in Europe. And that will certainly begin to provide us some financial rewards and the leverage that we will need to drive margins for that product moving forward. We've made significant investments and as you know in a plant, including a pen line. So we're set up very well to take advantage of the launch of BYDUREON globally. And as I said, we've got some time before the maturities that you've referred to, and we'll certainly look to opportunistically finance those in the future with the interest of maximizing shareholder value. In terms of your question on working capital, I want to make sure I'm clear on the question. Could you repeat it? Catherine Arnold - Crédit Suisse AG Yes. I just wondered if there's an opportunity to change some of your metrics on working capital, whether it's accounts receivable or inventory, where you might have a chance to start to bring some of those numbers down to maximize your cash flow? Mark Foletta Yes, well, that's been a focus. Our receivables turn very, very quickly. I mean in this industry, you get paid very fast on your receivables. So that's not really an issue for us. In terms of inventory, we do have some inventory on the balance sheet, in terms of API for both of our products. Much of that is tied to BYDUREON because we've built some inventory in advance. So I think you would look to see those metrics approved as we go forward again, tied to the launch of BYDUREON. Catherine Arnold - Crédit Suisse AG Great. And I wanted to ask you about the monthly BYDUREON. Could you talk about PK? There is some variability, obviously, in a once weekly BYDUREON versus BYETTA. And I am just wondering how we should be thinking about what PK variability exists with that product. And also not from a regulatory perspective and requirements, but would you see yourselves for competitive reasons doing a duration-like program on a monthly? Dan Bradbury Yes, I think in terms of PK, we will be presenting data on the program at a future scientific meeting. But I would remind you that the formulation that we're using is the same formulation that was used in BYDUREON. And that formulation was actually initially designed to be a monthly product. So we don't expect to see very substantial increases in variability from a PK standpoint. There will be some because you reduced your dosing frequency. But we don't expect, in fact, we have not seen very significant increases in PK variability. In terms of your second part of your question regarding doing a DURATION-like program, I think once we get guidance from regulatory authorities with regards to what the appropriate program would be for approval, we'll then make further decisions with regards to whether or not any additional studies would be warranted for the monthly program. Catherine Arnold - Crédit Suisse AG Thanks very much. Operator Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMC. Matthew Lowe - JP Morgan Chase & Co This is actually Matt Lowe in for Cory today. Many of my questions have been answered. But if I could just kind of revisit the European market for BYDUREON. Just wondering if you're expecting any kind of significant differences in that market versus what we might see in the U.S., and if you could also just speak to the commercial impacts of DURATION-6? Thanks. Dan Bradbury Thanks to your question. I'm going to ask Vince to answer both those questions regarding Europe and also the impact of DURATION-6. So, Vince? Vincent Mihalik Yes. Thanks, Dan. On the European market, obviously, as I was commenting earlier, we are seeing really good growth in adoption for GLP-1s in the European market. Of course, it varies by country and also varies by the reimbursement system. But for the most part, we are seeing major expansion, literally, more than doubling of the GLP-1 market in each of those countries. So with the launch of a second GLP-1 receptor agonist more, I would say, voices in the market, we're beginning to see greater expansion in the diabetes market of the GLP-1 class across all of Europe. So I think that bodes well for BYDUREON's presence in the European market. As it relates to the DURATION-6 and again, Dan made this comment that when you look across all of the DURATION series, and we look at A1C reductions across a wide range of patients with multiple different therapy backgrounds, we were really surprised at the results. If I take that forward, however, keep in mind that this is a very small difference statistically, so to speak, in hemoglobin A1C but not a very big difference clinically. And most physicians do weigh a number of variables in choosing what medication they're going to provide for patients. They look at efficacy. They look at safety. They look at tolerability. They look at convenience. They look at adherence, and they look at access. And all those things play together before they decide what particular medication they're going to give a patient. And if I again look at DURATION-6, BYDUREON demonstrated outstanding tolerability and, again, continuous control, glucose control, with a once weekly dose. So I think when physicians look across the entire range of DURATION-6 studies, when they look at the advantage of continuous control with once weekly dosing, the great tolerability potential for weight loss, its comparison to other most frequently prescribed anti-diabetes medications, I think it bodes very well for BYDUREON's competitiveness. Matthew Lowe - JP Morgan Chase & Co Yes, okay. That's great. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch Thank you. So relative to the sales of BYETTA, the collaborative profit sharing seemed a little bit higher than expected. I appreciate your efforts at lowering SG&A, but is there anything to a potential offset of your efforts by increased selling expense by Lilly and you have to true that up in that line item? Mark Foletta Steve, the collaborative profit sharing is 50% of the gross margin of BYETTA. I don't think it's out of line from any other quarter. So I'm not sure if I'm clear on your question. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch But if you're selling expense differs materially from Lilly's, isn't there a true-up in that line item? Mark Foletta No, we true that up right through the SG&A line item, so any true-up there... Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch That's in your SG&A. That true-up is in your SG&A? Mark Foletta Yes. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch So your gross margins on BYETTA are greater than they are in SYMLIN? Mark Foletta Yes. We're over 90% on BYETTA and so you should think of a collaborative profit-sharing line as pretty pure as 50% of the U.S. gross margin. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch And then I have a question on the once monthly for Vince. In your market research, do you see that the potential driver for this product being attracting those patients that are already GLP-1 patients? Or do you see that the once monthly could meaningfully pull in patients that are using other anti-diabetic therapies? Vincent Mihalik Thanks, Steve, for the question. And yes, I think you could say yes to both parts of that question. I think you're going to see patients who have started on GLP-1s. We have already good compliance and good adherence; want to move to a once monthly given their experiences and the ease and convenience of once-month dosing. And I think as well physicians may look at patients who are out of control, who have difficulty with adherence moving to once a month dosing because of its convenience and adherence. So I think you could say yes to both sides of that equation. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch Okay, thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Tom Russo with Baird. Thomas Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated Just putting some of the same topics, for DURATION-6, is part of the analysis and do you have any sense yet of when patients reached steady-state versus the six-month measurement of A1C? And did you continue any patients out beyond six-months in that study? Dan Bradbury No. In terms of DURATION-6, we actually don't have any analysis at this time that I can comment on. But also, there was no extension to this study. So we don't have any information for patients who went beyond that six months period. Thomas Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated Okay. And then on the once monthly, can you give any additional color on which dose had the 1.5% reduction in A1C and also can you say anything about weight loss versus BYDUREON in that study? Dan Bradbury Just to say that, well, we haven't the given any specifics with regards to the dosing information. That will be presented at a future scientific meeting. We're also, at this point, completing our work to make the final dose selection and that has not been made at this time. With regards to weight loss, I would just say that weight loss was consistent with that seen in previous studies with BYDUREON. Thomas Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated Okay. And last question, I think, maybe for Mark, the economics to Amylin from BYDUREON in Europe, I think you might have said in the past where the royalties start and can you also give any color, and can you confirm kind of where the royalties start and then whether the first step up in the tier is above or below the current run rate for BYETTA in Europe? Mark Foletta Yes, Tom. Thanks for the question. Yes, we did guide that this year, we expect to get -- we crossed the threshold actually right as we exited the quarter and we'll expect to begin to earn royalties relative to BYETTA in the O.U.S. market. With the BYDUREON launch, obviously, we'd expect revenue growth. But I think it's important to remind you the discussion we've had in the past about the gross margin transition for BYDUREON. This royalty is pegged to gross margin, and it is tiered. And we are currently -- as we move in the second half of the year, be in a kind of low- to mid-single digit percentage of gross margins or of royalty on gross margin. And we would expect a few years, Tom, to be able to drive the leverage within the margin line to be able to drive to the next tier. So I think, as you think of your models, obviously, it's very early in terms of thinking of a revenue line for O.U.S. But we would guide you to be conservative in terms of thinking of our margins over the next few years as we drive the leverage at the gross margin line with our plant in Ohio. Thomas Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated Okay. Thanks, Mark. Operator Our last question comes from John Sonnier with William Blair. John Sonnier - William Blair & Company L.L.C. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one on once monthly. I'm wondering, Dan, I guess, if the super therapeutic concentrations of exenatide that you've used in the tQT study exceed the concentrations of exenatide injected once monthly or if it's possibly you're going to have to push the dose or do a separate tQT trial for once monthly? Dan Bradbury Thanks, John. Nice to hear your voice. Just to say that we expect that the tQT study that's being conducted now would be adequate with regards to providing any assurances with regards to any effect on exenatide on QT prolongation or not. This case, as we don't believe will be the case for exenatide once monthly. The plasma concentrations that we expect to see with monthly are subject to the dose that we would select for that product. But even in the case of patients who would have some forms of renal impairment, we would expect that the data that we would generate from the ongoing tQT study would be adequate for us to be able to model what would be expected for those patients from that study. So our expectation is that the tQT study that's ongoing would be adequate for any submission for a monthly program. John Sonnier - William Blair & Company L.L.C. That's helpful. Thanks so much. Operator That does conclude the Q&A. Dan Bradbury Thanks very much, everybody. Again, thanks for your interest and for your questions today. We have a huge opportunity as a company to continue to advance our mission of discovering and developing and commercializing medicines to improve the lives of patients. Additionally, our leadership team and the many dedicated employees of Amylin remain focused both on building the business today and laying the necessary foundation for our success tomorrow.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce your host, Michael York, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Michael York [Audio Gap]  Provides additional background on the quarter. This morning's discussion will contain forward-looking statement that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are outlined in today's press release, the website presentation and in our recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our actual results could differ materially from what is discussed during today's call. The reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found at the end of the website presentation.  Let me introduce the other members of the Amylin management team for today. Daniel Bradbury, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Foletta, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Vince Mihalik, Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing and Chief Commercial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Dan Bradbury Dan Bradbury Thanks, Michael. Before I begin with our prepared remarks, I'd like to say that we were very pleased to note that during the quarter, BYDUREON received marketing authorization from the European regulatory authorities. And our partner, Eli Lilly and Company, recently launched the product in the United Kingdom.  The availability of the first weekly-dosed diabetes therapy in Europe marks a milestone for patients, physicians and the healthcare system. With just one dose per week, BYDUREON has consistently demonstrated in patients with type 2 diabetes powerful glucose control, the potential for weight loss and a favorable safety and tolerability profile. The opportunity to monitor the early stages of the launch in the United Kingdom and in other European countries gives us the opportunity to apply the insights we gained for the planned U.S. launch.  Now shifting back to our second quarter results, our comments this morning will build on the press release issued earlier today. In a few moments, Mark will provide additional details on the quarter's underlying financial results and comment on our outlook for 2011. Vince will then review our commercial activity during the second quarter of this year.  Over the last quarter, we continued our focused execution against our business plan, and I will take a moment to highlight our substantial progress. At the end of the quarter, we completed the thorough QT or tQT study for exenatide to address questions raised by the FDA in the complete response letter that was issued in October 2010 regarding our BYDUREON new drug application. The results, which we announced earlier this month, indicated that when using multiple heart rate correction methodologies, the study met the pre-specified primary endpoint demonstrating that exenatide, at and above therapeutic levels, did not prolong the corrective QT interval in healthy individuals. Additionally, the study found no relationship between QTc interval and the plasma exenatide concentrations. With the tQT study now complete, we expect to submit our response to the agency by next week.  We expect the submission of the tQT study data, along with DURATION-5 and the integrated safety update to be classified as a Class 2 resubmission and be granted a 6-month review timeline by the FDA. In addition to being positioned to respond to the FDA regarding the most recent BYDUREON complete response letter, we continued to make excellent progress on several important life cycle initiatives, which represent the next drivers of growth for BYDUREON and the exenatide molecule.  The development of a pen device for BYDUREON remains on track with an expected launch by the end of 2012 or in early 2013. Data from a Phase II study of our once-monthly injectable suspension formulation of exenatide showed the clinical profile comparable to BYDUREON, with substantial improvements in glycemic control. We expect regulatory interactions by the end of the year that will inform the design of the pivotal studies for the exenatide suspension program.  We have also continued to add centers and enroll patients for our ongoing EXCEL cardiovascular outcomes study, which is investigating the potential for BYDUREON to reduce cardiovascular events relative to the standard of care in patients with type 2 diabetes.  We also had a strong presence at this year's American Diabetes Association conference in June, with new data from more than 20 abstracts supporting safety and efficacy profiles of BYETTA, SYMLIN and BYDUREON. Of particular interest was an analysis of a large healthcare claims database showing that when compared to other diabetes therapies, use of BYETTA was associated with a 54% reduction in the likelihood of developing heart failure. This was a truly astounding finding, and I'd like to take a moment to highlight the devastating intersection between type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  At this juncture, it is clear that type 2 diabetes is a major risk factor for developing numerous forms of cardiovascular disease, with a growing repository of clinical and epidemiological studies supporting this fact. It is estimated that more than 3 quarters of U.S. hospitalizations for complications associated with diabetes are a result of cardiovascular disease, and that nearly 2/3 of type 2 diabetes patients will die from cardiovascular disease.  Specifically regarding heart failure, compared to patients without diabetes, type 2 diabetes patients are 2.5x more likely to develop congestive heart failure, with 12% of the overall diabetes population having established heart failure. That's approximately 3 million type 2 diabetes patients suffering from heart failure in the United States alone. These numbers are simply staggering, and I could continue with a litany of sobering statistics, but I think it's clear that with cardiovascular disease being one of the primary drivers of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes, the need for diabetes therapies that help address cardiovascular risk factors is substantial.  We, here at Amylin, believe that GLP-1 receptor agonist class has the potential to help manage cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes patients and deliver robust value to the healthcare system. Indeed, as physicians and patients gain experience with GLP-1 therapy and new data are published in support of the safety and efficacy of the class, the GLP-1 market continues to demonstrate steady growth. Data from the first week in July indicates that total prescriptions are 54% higher than the week prior to the launch of a second entrant in the class in February of 2010. On a 4-week moving average basis, we've seen growth of approximately 35% in the same timeframe. In terms of sales, the class is on a run rate of greater than $1 billion in the United States this year. All of these signs point to the growing recognition of the value delivered by GLP-1 therapies. And we are extremely enthusiastic about having the opportunity to launch BYDUREON into a growing class supported by a building groundswell of clinical and real-world data.  In addition to the exciting progress we're making with our exenatide franchise, we continue to make progress with metreleptin for rare forms of lipodystrophy. At the end of last year, we submitted the clinical and non-clinical sections of a Biologics License Application or BLA for the use of metreleptin to treat diabetes and/or hypertriglyceridemia in pediatric and adult patients with inherited or acquired lipodystrophy. We plan to submit the chemistry, manufacturing and control sections and complete the BLA by the end of this year. Given fast track and priority review designations, metreleptin could be available to lipodystrophy patients in late 2012.  Metreleptin is fully aligned with our focus on endocrine and metabolic disease and enables us to use our existing commercial infrastructure, thereby providing additional leverage to our income statement following the planned launch of BYDUREON. We will provide an update on the U.S. commercial plans, along with the opportunity ex-U.S. in the fourth quarter.  To round out my comments regarding our progress thus far this year, I'd like to reinforce the fact that while we continue to drive revenue from our marketed products and advance our key pipeline assets, we will continue to aggressively manage our expenses in line with our expected revenues. As Mark will highlight momentarily, our strong second quarter and first half financial results reflect the continued emphasis we are placing on controlling our spending and driving efficiencies across our business.  I'll now turn things over to Mark to review our financial results released earlier today. Mark Foletta Thanks, Dan, and good morning. Today, we announced our financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2011. As Dan mentioned, and we have discussed in prior calls, we are managing the business with operational discipline and are focused on generating sustainable, positive operating cash flow and maintaining a strong cash position. Our measure of operating cash flow is non-GAAP operating loss, which approximates our cash flow from operations before working capital changes. Non-GAAP operating loss is defined as our GAAP operating loss, adjusted for non-cash items, including equity compensation, depreciation and amortization, and any other unusual items such as restructuring charges.  In the second quarter, non-GAAP operating loss was $1.7 million, an improvement from a loss of $7.4 million in the second quarter of 2010. Total revenues in the second quarter were $158.1 million, a 3.8% decrease compared to $164.4 million in the second quarter of 2010. Our gross margins remained strong at 92%. Our operating expenses were $110.3 million in the second quarter, consisting of $65.2 million of selling, general and administrative expenses and $45.1 million of research and development expenses. This represents an overall $9.9 million or 8% reduction from $120.2 million in the same quarter of last year. This decrease reflects our continued focus on driving efficiencies across our business. For further details regarding our financial results reported today, please refer to the presentation available in the Investors section at our company website.  I'd like to make a few additional comments comparing the second quarter of 2011 sequentially to the first quarter of 2011. BYETTA sales were up $1 million sequentially or 0.8%, reflecting pricing actions during the quarter, partially offset by a 3.1% decline in prescription volume. SYMLIN sales were up $3 million or 13.2% sequentially. The revenue growth seen with SYMLIN was driven by an increase in 10 prescriptions and pricing actions during the quarter. Vince will discuss BYETTA and SYMLIN prescription trends in more detail later in the call.  Wholesaler inventories at June 30 were comparable to those at March 31, and we believe are consistent with patient demand. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $1.7 million for the second quarter compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of $3.2 million in the first quarter. I'll now quickly review top and bottom line results for the first half of 2011. Total revenues for the first half of the year were $310.8 million, an 8% decrease from $338.5 million in the first half of 2010. Non-GAAP operating loss improved 56% to $5 million for the first half of 2011 from $11.2 million for the same period last year. In late 2008, we established a plan to manage expenses in line with revenues, and we continue to deliver results that reflect operational discipline. In fact, since the beginning of 2010, we have basically been running at operating cash flow breakeven with a cumulative non-GAAP operating loss of approximately $9 million during those 18 months. Our plans for managing expenses have also placed substantial emphasis on cash preservation, and we ended the first half in a strong financial position with $444 million in cash, short-term investments and restricted cash. Excluding financing activities in the second quarter related to the $200 million convertible note maturity and the $165 million drawdown of a loan from Eli Lilly and Company, our cash balance increased by approximately $20 million in the first half of 2011.  As we progress through the second half of the year, our focus remains on managing our business close to cash flow neutral and conserving our cash balance. For full details of our financial results, please refer to the press release we issued earlier today.  I'd now like to provide an update regarding key trends and assumptions for the remainder of 2011. Entering 2011, we guided that the normalized run rate for our quarterly GAAP operating expenses were between $110 million and $115 million and that this level would decline during the year. Our spending was at the low end of this range in the first half of the year, but variability in our quarterly operating expenses is expected. We will continue to drive efficiencies across the organization.  Non-GAAP operating results continue to be the key metric we use to measure our financial performance. We now expect a non-GAAP operating loss of $15 million to $25 million below our previous guidance of the low end of the range of $25 million to $40 million. We earned a $15 million milestone upon the launch of BYDUREON in the European Union earlier this month. This milestone will be reflected in our income statement during the third quarter. At the end of the first quarter, the cumulative gross margin threshold for sales of exenatide outside the United States was crossed, and we began to record royalties in the second quarter. These royalties, based on the gross profits outside the United States, are tiered, and we continue to expect that the total amount earned in 2011 will be less than $5 million. We remain confident that we will be able to maintain strong combined gross margins for BYETTA and SYMLIN of at least 90%.  We also continue to expect net interest expense to be $25 million to $30 million. Consistent with our most recent guidance, we expect non-cash adjustments, including depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, to be approximately $90 million in 2011.  To summarize, our second quarter results are a direct result of our ongoing efforts to achieve additional efficiencies in our business and preserve cash. As we look to the future, we will opportunistically manage our financial risk with a focus on maximizing shareholder value.  Now I will turn the call over to Vince to review our commercial activities. Vincent Mihalik Thank you, Mark. The Amylin sales and marketing organization continues to remain focused on our day-to-day business, driving revenue for our currently marketed products, BYETTA and SYMLIN, and preparing for the launch of BYDUREON in the United States. From a clinical standpoint, we had a strong presence at this year's ADA conference, with new data supporting the safety and efficacy profiles of BYETTA, SYMLIN and BYDUREON. Notably, we presented long-term data from the BYDUREON clinical program, demonstrating that the benefits of BYDUREON therapy are sustained in patients out to 3 years. Results like these add to the growing body of data that supports the value proposition that BYDUREON could deliver to the healthcare system if approved.  Specifically for patients, BYDUREON provides continuous glucose control with a single weekly injection and no dose adjustments or multi-step titration schedules. These attributes, along with an improved GI tolerability profile relative to BYETTA, could help BYDUREON fit conveniently into patients' lives. For providers, BYDUREON carries the safety and efficacy heritage of the exenatide molecule, along with consistent A1C reduction across patient types.  For payers, real-world data from their extensive claims database where their members are taking BYETTA, along with head-to-head comparative efficacy data from the DURATION program, both highlight the potential benefits of exenatide therapy. With BYDUREON now available in the United Kingdom, we're excited to have the opportunity to monitor the early stages of the launch there and in other European countries as it becomes available, and apply those insights we gained to the planned U.S. launch.  Now let's move on to discuss our results in the second quarter, starting with BYETTA. BYETTA sales increased approximately 1% quarter-over-quarter. The increase in sales were generally in line with pricing actions during the quarter, offset by a 3.1% decline in prescription volume. We continue to see physicians start new patients on BYETTA because of our well-established safety profile, our strong effects on postprandial glucoses and our competitive access. We are encouraged by the fact that the GLP-1 class in the United States continues to steadily grow and believe this is a clear sign that the market is willing to adopt new entrants into this important class of therapies, a sign that bodes well for the launch of BYDUREON.  Additionally, the clinical data we're generating is being used by our managed care team to reinforce with payers the value delivered with BYETTA therapy, and we continue to maintain broad managed care coverage with greater than 80% Tier 2 access. This strategic advantage will serve as a platform for our planned launch of BYDUREON.  Simply put, for patients, providers and payers, BYETTA has proven and sustained A1C control, powerful postprandial and fasting blood glucose reductions, potential for improved beta cell function, a low risk of hypoglycemia, strong patient support programs and broad managed care access. Now let's move on to SYMLIN, the first and only FDA-approved Amylin analog. As a reminder, SYMLIN is our wholly-owned compound, that addresses unmet needs for patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, who use mealtime insulin. SYMLIN reduces blood glucose fluctuations for more time in the normal range and improves glucose control, often with weight-loss.  As Mark mentioned earlier, SYMLIN revenues increased by approximately 13.2% during the quarter. The revenue growth seen with SYMLIN was driven by an increase in pen prescriptions and pricing actions during the quarter. As expected, we continue to see some volatility in SYMLIN prescriptions as the remaining SYMLIN vials work their way through the channel following the discontinuation of this presentation.  Our conversion efforts continue, and we are now seeing the pen account for greater than 95% of all prescriptions, with the majority of the remaining vial inventory in individual retailers. The net impact of the transition away from the vial was a decline in total prescriptions of approximately 3%. Let me close my portion of the remarks by saying that we continue to build momentum and enthusiasm for the GLP-1 market while we prepare for the launch of BYDUREON and for a potential launch of BYETTA plus basal, if approved, an important indication that creates additional opportunities for BYETTA in the future.  I'll now turn the call back over to Dan for a few additional thoughts. Dan Bradbury Thanks, Vince. Before the close of our prepared remarks, I'd like to thank the employees of Amylin for their hard work and dedication through the first half of this year. Their efforts and commitment to the organization have enabled us to respond to the FDA ahead of our own expectations while delivering strong financial results. And for that, they deserve to be commended.  In closing, I'd like to reiterate that I, along with the Amylin leadership team, remain committed to creating value for our shareholders, our employees and most importantly, the millions of diabetes patients we're focused on serving.  I will now ask the operator to open the line for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Cory Kasimov of JPMC. Cory Kasimov - JP Morgan Chase & Co First question for you is on the recent launch of BYDUREON in the U.K. Can you comment on the pricing over there, especially as it relates to Victoza and BYETTA? And then I have one follow up after that. Dan Bradbury It's Dan here. Thanks for your question. Actually, I can't comment on it. The responsibility for pricing outside the United States is the responsibility of Lilly. And their strategy that is being employed. Obviously, in the United States, the responsibility for pricing for BYDUREON is the responsibility of Amylin. And at the point that we launch BYDUREON, I will make that available to people. So sorry, I can't comment on Lilly's strategy. Cory Kasimov - JP Morgan Chase & Co Okay. Fair enough. Then recognizing you haven't yet met with the FDA regarding exenatide once monthly, can you offer up any sort of additional thoughts on what the Phase III program might look like for that program? And this -- should we assume something that is roughly comparable to the DURATION program? Dan Bradbury Sure. So obviously, we want to agree with the FDA the specifics of the program going forward. However, I think it's fair to say that our expectation is that the program would be one that would be consistent with the BYDUREON program in that it would be a line extension development program, and we would expect that the reference to that program would be BYETTA as the initial product that was registered with the exenatide molecule. Operator Your next question comes from Ian Somaiya, Piper Jaffray. Matthew Luchini Great. Matthew Luchini, actually, covering for Ian this morning. Just one quick question. I was wondering if you could comment. Obviously, there was much with regards to the thorough QT study, the results that you guys presented earlier in the month. And I was just wondering if you could comment at all on -- if you are expecting, or you have any feeling that you might have to do something similar for the once-monthly exenatide formulation? And if so, would that then mean that you would be thinking of more of a 2-fold development plan, or continue along the line extension path as you were just describing. Dan Bradbury Yes. Thanks, Matthew. Thanks for the question. I guess our expectation would be, and to be clear, that the tQT study that was just completed was conducted with exenatide and helped the individuals at therapeutic and higher-than-therapeutic levels, levels certainly that would be greater than those, which would be expected with exenatide once monthly. So our expectation would be that the tQT study that we just completed would be referenceable for the exenatide once-monthly program going forward. Operator Your next question comes from Catherine Arnold, Credit Suisse. Catherine Arnold - Crédit Suisse AG I wanted to ask you about your launch plan. So assuming a 6-month review for BYDUREON and given what you said about the filing next week, I would assume you'd be solidly in the first quarter of 2012. So I'm wondering, are you thinking about the ability to launch in days or weeks after approval? And when should we start building an uptick in SG&A expenses to account for that? And then, I just wanted to ask you another follow-up, which is on the pen, could you just talk about what are the sort of touch points or levers that will determine whether the pen actually is launched at the end of '12 or '13 or into '13? Is that something that you can control, or is that something that's in the hands of regulators? Dan Bradbury Yes. What I'll do is maybe I could talk initially about -- pass over to Vince to talk about launch plans, and then ask Mark to talk about SG&A. And I'll come back and talk to you about the pen. So maybe, Vince, do you want to talk about launch plans and then Mark, about SG&A? Vincent Mihalik Sure. So, Catherine, obviously, much depends on the label you get from the FDA and how different it may be from the proposed label because you can print at risk to try to shorten down the launch timeframes, but if there's major differences in the final label, then obviously, we have to throw all that away and start over. So I would say, in terms of planning, you're probably thinking in weeks rather not -- rather than days, just to be on the safe side. And of course, we'll try to launch as quickly after approval as we can. But keeping in mind that, obviously, with the second complete response letter, we did slow down the manufacturing folks and actually put the line into a mothball, so to speak. We'll have to dust that off a little bit, and we already are in the process of doing it in anticipation of, as you pointed out, likely a first quarter launch. Mark Foletta Yes. Thanks, Vince. This is Mark. Catherine, I'll comment on your question about the SG&A expenses. First and foremost, we'll be watching the activities with the regulators very carefully, and clearly, be ready to launch, as Vince said, when the regulators approve the product. In terms of upticks, the guidance that we gave -- I gave a few moments ago really contemplates that we will begin preparation activities in the second half of the year. And I do want to remind you though that while there is going to be incremental non-recurring cost to support the launch of BYDUREON that our current operating model and the sales footprint that we have and the infrastructure that we put in place will support the launch of BYDUREON, and also remind you that we will earn a $40 million milestone on the U.S. launch. Of course, that is anticipated based upon our filing very soon here that would be earned in the first quarter. But that would certainly offset expenses associated with the launch. And just to emphasize that we've also been focused on our operating model and don't see significant incremental expenses across the business to enable the launch of BYDUREON. Dan Bradbury Well, Catherine, Dan here. I'll just get back to you regarding your question regarding the BYDUREON pen. What we've guided is that we expect to be able to launch the BYDUREON pen by the end of 2012 or the beginning of 2013. Obviously, we've given ourselves a fair window there largely due to regulatory uncertainty. So I think the answer to your question is yes and yes, in that there is work that we still need to complete for the BYDUREON pen, but we have also built in some flexibility with respect to the timing of expected regulatory approval. Operator Your next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas, Deutsche Bank. Alethia Young This is Alethia Young for Robyn Karnauskas. And I just had a question about the Amylin-Lilly lawsuit. Just kind of walk me through the next steps that you guys are thinking about as far as the appeal process and what the timing could look like though on that? Dan Bradbury So the lawsuit is ongoing. I really can't comment too much on the specifics of the lawsuit but just to say that we do have an appeal with respect to the preliminary injunction, which is being reviewed currently by -- in the appellate court. However, the main lawsuit is continuing and will continue for some time. I would also add that we intend to work with our partner, Eli Lilly, in the meantime to ensure that we successfully launch BYDUREON together. Operator Your next question comes from Yaron Werber, Citigroup. Kumaraguru Raja This is Kumaraguru Raja stepping in for Yaron Werber. Can you give us an update on how the litigation is going to impact the launch of BYDUREON together? Dan Bradbury Yes. So just to reiterate what I've just said into the previous caller, our expectation is that both Lilly and ourselves will work together to ensure that BYDUREON is successfully launched. It's in both companies' interest to ensure that, that is the case, and both companies have committed to that end. Operator Your next question comes from Terence Flynn, Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. I just wanted to follow up on an earlier one, regarding manufacturing of BYDUREON. Just wondering if you're planning to start building inventory and -- manufacturing inventory and building it in advance of an FDA decision in the first quarter, or if you're going to wait until that decision comes until you start to actually building the inventory? I know you said you dusted off some of the equipment but just wondering the actual production, when that's going to start? Dan Bradbury So, Dan here. It's a great question. Terence, the -- so the BYDUREON manufacturing process has multiple components to it. So the manufacturing of both microspheres and the filling of vials has already begun and is continuing as part of the manufacturing for the European launches that are occurring. The key aspect that needs to be undertaken here in the United States is actually the -- that Vince referred to is related to the packaging line. The work for that is ongoing now at this point. We implemented that just at the completion of the tQT study. And so our expectations are that we will build inventory coming into the launch, but the final packaging, as Vince mentioned earlier, is somewhat -- is dependent upon the approval, and therefore, we have to wait until that's printed before we fully package the products for launch. But that is a very short timeframe, by the way. Once we know what that is, it's a very short timeframe for the completion of that process. Operator Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum, ISI Group. Omar Rifat This is Omar filling in for Mark. A couple of quick follow-ups. First one is, how many patients in the QT study actually touched around 1,000 kilograms per millimeter plasma concentration? And secondly, on the QT press release, I know it stated that the 95% comps interval for the mean QT chain was less than 10 milliseconds. Just to clarify, was this for the largest time mean QT change or not? Dan Bradbury It's Dan here. With regards to the specifics of the study, we'll be releasing those as part of our presentation at the scientific forum going forward. And I actually don't have to -- my fingertips here the specifics with regards the number of patients who went above 1,000 kilograms per ml. Regarding -- and again, the details with regards to the 95% competence [ph], I'll refer to one of our scientists, who will get back to you after the call. Okay? Operator Your next question comes from Tom Russo of Baird. Thomas Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated Maybe for Vince, can you give us some additional color on the GLP-1 growth? Maybe how much is being driven by and those who already like this class, but are prescribing it more versus how much is being driven by new adoption in the PCP group? And then do you expect any differences in that dynamic once BYDUREON comes to market? Vincent Mihalik So Tom, thanks for the question. Let me first say that as you know, type 2 diabetes continues to grow at about 6% to 7% annually. And we are seeing some really nice growth in adoption in the GLP-1 market. The U.S. GLP-1 market was about $260 million in the first quarter. So it's trending to be about greater than $1 billion, I'd say, in 2011. And given current growth rates, I think, it could be $2 billion in 2012. And we're seeing substantial growth in both the U.S. and Europe. I think that does reflect greater interest and understanding of the needs and benefits of GLP-1 given the number of people not making a goal. I'd also say, that to your question, endos write the vast majority of scripts in percentages. But if you look at the number of writers, PCPs dominate. Therefore, more PCP writers than endos. And we're seeing greater adoption among even more PCPs. This is not surprising. I've always talked about the fact that the size of the diabetes market, if you look at where the vast majority of scripts are, 80% of all scripts come from about 45,000 to 50,000 writers, and they are a combination of endos and PCPs. And those are the most active group, as you would expect, with GLP-1s. So we do see physicians embracing GLP-1s more. We're seeing that with the second entrance in the GLP-1 market that they're embracing it for not only its benefits, but also convenient dosing. And I think all of that bodes very well for BYDUREON. Thomas Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated Okay. And then, just a quick check-in, maybe for Mark. Is there a point in time where you would contemplate guiding revenues again? And if so, is that levered to BYDUREON approval or some period of time after that where you have some experience on the market? That's it. Dan Bradbury Mark, go ahead. Mark Foletta Yes. Thanks, Tom. Certainly, that's something we will consider. I think we want to get through the regulatory process, kind of assess the market, and we'll consider that at a future time. We have guided revenues in the past. I think I'd just want to emphasize that we think the most important thing that -- for us to manage over the last few several quarters has been our cash use and our non-GAAP operating loss. And that's, obviously, where our focus has been. And as you know, we've performed really on our guidance there. But we'll contemplate further guidance on our income statement following the launch of BYDUREON. But thanks for the question. Operator [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Phil Nadeau, Cowen and Company Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC My question is actually on metreleptin. I appreciate that you're going to give us more commercial guidance towards the end of this year, but just curious what your commercial team is doing to prepare for the launch today. Are you identifying patients or talking about leaders, kind of what type of activities are underway? Dan Bradbury Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, actually, we've got a lot of activities underway at the moment. We're specifically working with key thought leaders in the area. We're identifying patients at this time. And part of our commercial assessment that we're completing at the moment is really to understand better the epidemiology relating to these rare forms of lipodystrophy. And we're undertaking a lot of work in that respect. We're also working through working with multiple different commercial vendors, who would be providing specialty services that would be associated with the launch of metreleptin. As you, I'm sure, appreciate, this is a very rare disease, or rare diseases, I should say. They are very rare diseases. And as a result, they require a very specialized commercial approach. So there's actually a very large number of activities underway at the moment. I don't know, Vince, maybe you'd like to add more to my comments? Vincent Mihalik Actually, Dan, I think you've covered it pretty well. Obviously, at this stage, a lot of market research, a lot of advisory panels with KOLs, clearly trying to understand the different rare forms and also understanding how reimbursement might play into this and how we would actually register patients potentially as a way to identify even greater numbers and making sure we understand the different rare types of this disease and how that all plays out. So I think you covered it pretty well. Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC Could you give us a sense of your updated thoughts on the epidemiology? How many patients are out there, or how many patients would be appropriate for treatment? Dan Bradbury Yes. So we've guided that our thoughts today are that the covering the spectrum of the rare forms of lipodystrophy, for which we've applied for is around 1,200 patients here in the United States, around 3,000 globally. We're trying to get, as I mentioned earlier, greater specificity in that regard. And also within that estimate, also trying to get greater specificity with respect to each of the different rare forms of lipodystrophy that are being covered as part of our application. One of the key things for us to work out is the range of patients with regards to this variety of disease, and therefore, the likelihood with respect to the use of metreleptin and of course, the dosing of metreleptin that would be used. And that impacts our pricing decisions. Operator At this time, I would now like to turn the call to Dan Bradbury for closing comments. Dan Bradbury Well, again, thank you, this morning, for your interest and for your questions. We have a huge opportunity to continue to advance our mission of discovering, developing and commercializing medicines to improve the lives of patients, particularly those patients with diabetes. We continue to be excited about the prospects for BYDUREON in the near term, and I would like to also take this point to say, once again, thank you to our leadership team and to the dedicated employees of Amylin, who remain focused on building the business today, as well as laying the necessary foundation to success for tomorrow.

But keeping in mind that, obviously, with the second complete response letter, we did slow down the manufacturing folks and actually put the line into a mothball, so to speak. We'll have to dust that off a little bit, and we already are in the process of doing it in anticipation of, as you pointed out, likely a first quarter launch. Mark Foletta Yes. Thanks, Vince. This is Mark. Catherine, I'll comment on your question about the SG&A expenses. First and foremost, we'll be watching the activities with the regulators very carefully, and clearly, be ready to launch, as Vince said, when the regulators approve the product. In terms of upticks, the guidance that we gave -- I gave a few moments ago really contemplates that we will begin preparation activities in the second half of the year. And I do want to remind you though that while there is going to be incremental non-recurring cost to support the launch of BYDUREON that our current operating model and the sales footprint that we have and the infrastructure that we put in place will support the launch of BYDUREON, and also remind you that we will earn a $40 million milestone on the U.S. launch. Of course, that is anticipated based upon our filing very soon here that would be earned in the first quarter. But that would certainly offset expenses associated with the launch. And just to emphasize that we've also been focused on our operating model and don't see significant incremental expenses across the business to enable the launch of BYDUREON. Dan Bradbury Well, Catherine, Dan here. I'll just get back to you regarding your question regarding the BYDUREON pen. What we've guided is that we expect to be able to launch the BYDUREON pen by the end of 2012 or the beginning of 2013. Obviously, we've given ourselves a fair window there largely due to regulatory uncertainty. So I think the answer to your question is yes and yes, in that there is work that we still need to complete for the BYDUREON pen, but we have also built in some flexibility with respect to the timing of expected regulatory approval. Operator Your next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas, Deutsche Bank. Alethia Young This is Alethia Young for Robyn Karnauskas. And I just had a question about the Amylin-Lilly lawsuit. Just kind of walk me through the next steps that you guys are thinking about as far as the appeal process and what the timing could look like though on that? Dan Bradbury So the lawsuit is ongoing. I really can't comment too much on the specifics of the lawsuit but just to say that we do have an appeal with respect to the preliminary injunction, which is being reviewed currently by -- in the appellate court. However, the main lawsuit is continuing and will continue for some time. I would also add that we intend to work with our partner, Eli Lilly, in the meantime to ensure that we successfully launch BYDUREON together. Operator Your next question comes from Yaron Werber, Citigroup. Kumaraguru Raja This is Kumaraguru Raja stepping in for Yaron Werber. Can you give us an update on how the litigation is going to impact the launch of BYDUREON together? Dan Bradbury Yes. So just to reiterate what I've just said into the previous caller, our expectation is that both Lilly and ourselves will work together to ensure that BYDUREON is successfully launched. It's in both companies' interest to ensure that, that is the case, and both companies have committed to that end. Operator Your next question comes from Terence Flynn, Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. I just wanted to follow up on an earlier one, regarding manufacturing of BYDUREON. Just wondering if you're planning to start building inventory and -- manufacturing inventory and building it in advance of an FDA decision in the first quarter, or if you're going to wait until that decision comes until you start to actually building the inventory? I know you said you dusted off some of the equipment but just wondering the actual production, when that's going to start? Dan Bradbury So, Dan here. It's a great question. Terence, the -- so the BYDUREON manufacturing process has multiple components to it. So the manufacturing of both microspheres and the filling of vials has already begun and is continuing as part of the manufacturing for the European launches that are occurring. The key aspect that needs to be undertaken here in the United States is actually the -- that Vince referred to is related to the packaging line. The work for that is ongoing now at this point. We implemented that just at the completion of the tQT study. And so our expectations are that we will build inventory coming into the launch, but the final packaging, as Vince mentioned earlier, is somewhat -- is dependent upon the approval, and therefore, we have to wait until that's printed before we fully package the products for launch. But that is a very short timeframe, by the way. Once we know what that is, it's a very short timeframe for the completion of that process. Operator Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum, ISI Group. Omar Rifat This is Omar filling in for Mark. A couple of quick follow-ups. First one is, how many patients in the QT study actually touched around 1,000 kilograms per millimeter plasma concentration? And secondly, on the QT press release, I know it stated that the 95% comps interval for the mean QT chain was less than 10 milliseconds. Just to clarify, was this for the largest time mean QT change or not? Dan Bradbury It's Dan here. With regards to the specifics of the study, we'll be releasing those as part of our presentation at the scientific forum going forward. And I actually don't have to -- my fingertips here the specifics with regards the number of patients who went above 1,000 kilograms per ml. Regarding -- and again, the details with regards to the 95% competence [ph], I'll refer to one of our scientists, who will get back to you after the call. Okay? Operator Your next question comes from Tom Russo of Baird. Thomas Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated Maybe for Vince, can you give us some additional color on the GLP-1 growth? Maybe how much is being driven by and those who already like this class, but are prescribing it more versus how much is being driven by new adoption in the PCP group? And then do you expect any differences in that dynamic once BYDUREON comes to market? Vincent Mihalik So Tom, thanks for the question. Let me first say that as you know, type 2 diabetes continues to grow at about 6% to 7% annually. And we are seeing some really nice growth in adoption in the GLP-1 market. The U.S. GLP-1 market was about $260 million in the first quarter. So it's trending to be about greater than $1 billion, I'd say, in 2011. And given current growth rates, I think, it could be $2 billion in 2012. And we're seeing substantial growth in both the U.S. and Europe. I think that does reflect greater interest and understanding of the needs and benefits of GLP-1 given the number of people not making a goal. I'd also say, that to your question, endos write the vast majority of scripts in percentages. But if you look at the number of writers, PCPs dominate. Therefore, more PCP writers than endos. And we're seeing greater adoption among even more PCPs. This is not surprising. I've always talked about the fact that the size of the diabetes market, if you look at where the vast majority of scripts are, 80% of all scripts come from about 45,000 to 50,000 writers, and they are a combination of endos and PCPs. And those are the most active group, as you would expect, with GLP-1s. So we do see physicians embracing GLP-1s more. We're seeing that with the second entrance in the GLP-1 market that they're embracing it for not only its benefits, but also convenient dosing. And I think all of that bodes very well for BYDUREON. Thomas Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated Okay. And then, just a quick check-in, maybe for Mark. Is there a point in time where you would contemplate guiding revenues again? And if so, is that levered to BYDUREON approval or some period of time after that where you have some experience on the market? That's it. Dan Bradbury Mark, go ahead. Mark Foletta Yes. Thanks, Tom. Certainly, that's something we will consider. I think we want to get through the regulatory process, kind of assess the market, and we'll consider that at a future time. We have guided revenues in the past. I think I'd just want to emphasize that we think the most important thing that -- for us to manage over the last few several quarters has been our cash use and our non-GAAP operating loss. And that's, obviously, where our focus has been. And as you know, we've performed really on our guidance there. But we'll contemplate further guidance on our income statement following the launch of BYDUREON. But thanks for the question. Operator [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Phil Nadeau, Cowen and Company Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC My question is actually on metreleptin. I appreciate that you're going to give us more commercial guidance towards the end of this year, but just curious what your commercial team is doing to prepare for the launch today. Are you identifying patients or talking about leaders, kind of what type of activities are underway? Dan Bradbury Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, actually, we've got a lot of activities underway at the moment. We're specifically working with key thought leaders in the area. We're identifying patients at this time. And part of our commercial assessment that we're completing at the moment is really to understand better the epidemiology relating to these rare forms of lipodystrophy. And we're undertaking a lot of work in that respect. We're also working through working with multiple different commercial vendors, who would be providing specialty services that would be associated with the launch of metreleptin. As you, I'm sure, appreciate, this is a very rare disease, or rare diseases, I should say. They are very rare diseases. And as a result, they require a very specialized commercial approach. So there's actually a very large number of activities underway at the moment. I don't know, Vince, maybe you'd like to add more to my comments? Vincent Mihalik Actually, Dan, I think you've covered it pretty well. Obviously, at this stage, a lot of market research, a lot of advisory panels with KOLs, clearly trying to understand the different rare forms and also understanding how reimbursement might play into this and how we would actually register patients potentially as a way to identify even greater numbers and making sure we understand the different rare types of this disease and how that all plays out. So I think you covered it pretty well. Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC Could you give us a sense of your updated thoughts on the epidemiology? How many patients are out there, or how many patients would be appropriate for treatment? Dan Bradbury Yes. So we've guided that our thoughts today are that the covering the spectrum of the rare forms of lipodystrophy, for which we've applied for is around 1,200 patients here in the United States, around 3,000 globally. We're trying to get, as I mentioned earlier, greater specificity in that regard. And also within that estimate, also trying to get greater specificity with respect to each of the different rare forms of lipodystrophy that are being covered as part of our application. One of the key things for us to work out is the range of patients with regards to this variety of disease, and therefore, the likelihood with respect to the use of metreleptin and of course, the dosing of metreleptin that would be used. And that impacts our pricing decisions. Operator At this time, I would now like to turn the call to Dan Bradbury for closing comments. Dan Bradbury Well, again, thank you, this morning, for your interest and for your questions. We have a huge opportunity to continue to advance our mission of discovering, developing and commercializing medicines to improve the lives of patients, particularly those patients with diabetes. We continue to be excited about the prospects for BYDUREON in the near term, and I would like to also take this point to say, once again, thank you to our leadership team and to the dedicated employees of Amylin, who remain focused on building the business today, as well as laying the necessary foundation to success for tomorrow. If you have any further questions regarding today's call, please call Michael York or Jeff Erickson in our IR team. Thank you. Operator Thank you for participating in today's conference.

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce your host, Michael York, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Michael York Good afternoon, and welcome to Amylin Pharmaceuticals Quarterly Update Conference Call. We\'ve uploaded a presentation to accompany this conference call that provides additional background on the quarter. This afternoon\'s discussion will contain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are outlined in today\'s press release, the website presentation and in our recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our actual results could differ materially from what is discussed during today\'s call. A reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found at the end of the website presentation. Let me introduce the other members of the Amylin management team here today: Daniel Bradbury, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Foletta, Senior Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer; and Vince Mihalik, Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing, and Chief Commercial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Dan Bradbury. Dan Bradbury Thanks, Michael. And welcome to our third quarter call for 2011. This afternoon\'s call regarding our third quarter results will build on the earnings press release issued earlier today. In a few moments, Mark will provide additional details on the quarter\'s underlying financial results and comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2011. Vince will then review our commercial activities during the third quarter of this year. Over the last quarter, we continued to execute our business plan and have made substantial progress against our objectives for the year. Revenues from our marketed products, BYETTA and SYMLIN, remained steady quarter-over-quarter and our focus on managing expenses and maintaining financial discipline enabled us to continue running our business close to breakeven. In fact, we earned non-GAAP operating income of $13 million during the third quarter. Earlier in the quarter, we announced that we responded to the second BYDUREON complete response letter. And based on ongoing interactions with the FDA, we continue to expect that their review will be completed by January 28 PDUFA date. We are continuing pre-launch activities and we\'ll be in position to have BYDUREON available to patients shortly after approval. The anticipation of launching BYDUREON here in the United States has us and the broader diabetes community buzzing with excitement. With BYDUREON now available in the U.K. and more recently Germany, this sense of excitement continues to grow, with early feedback from patients and healthcare practitioners in both markets being overwhelmingly positive. Though it\'s still too early in both launches to have solid data regarding prescription volume, demand in wholesale channels has been very strong, particularly in Germany. We also continue to make excellent progress on several important pipeline and life cycle initiatives. We continue to look forward to the FDA\'s anticipated decision within the next week on an expanded label for BYETTA for use with insulin glargine, which would result in an important new treatment option for patients. The development of a pen device for BYDUREON remains on track, with an expected launch by the end of 2012 or in early 2013. Regarding the exenatide suspension program, we expect regulatory interactions by the end of the year that will inform the design of pivotal studies for both the weekly and monthly exenatide formulations. And we will provide you with an update about our plans for this important initiative following those interactions. We also continue to add centers and enroll patients for our ongoing EXSCEL cardiovascular outcome study, which is investigating the potential for BYDUREON to reduce cardiovascular events relative to the standard of care in patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition to the exciting progress we\'re making with our exenatide franchise, we continue to make progress with metreleptin for rare forms of lipodystrophy. At the end of last year, we submitted the clinical and nonclinical sections of a Biologics License Application or BLA for the use of metreleptin to treat diabetes and/or hypertriglyceridemia in pediatric and adult patients with inherited or acquired lipodystrophy. Our plan at the start of this year was to submit the chemistry, manufacturing and control sections and complete the BLA by the end of this year. We have successfully completed the drug substance validation runs and are now in the process of generating stability data in support of our planned submission. However, capacity issues with our contract manufacturer and complexities encountered during the validation runs have caused us to move our target date for the BLA completion into the first half of 2012. We remain committed to bringing this new therapy to market as soon as possible and we\'ll be providing an update regarding the commercial outlook for the lipodystrophy opportunity at the beginning of next year. To round up my comments regarding our progress thus far this year, I\'d like to reinforce the fact that while we continue to drive revenue from our marketed products and advance our key pipeline assets, we will continue to aggressively manage our expenses in line with our expected revenues. As Mark will highlight momentarily, our strong third quarter and year-to-date financial results reflect the continued emphasis we are placing on controlling our spending and driving efficiencies across our business. I\'ll now turn things over to Mark to review our financial results released earlier today. Mark G. Foletta Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon. Today, we announced our financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2011. As Dan mentioned and we have discussed in previous calls, we are managing the business with operational discipline and are focused on generating sustainable, positive operating cash flow and maintaining a strong cash position. Our measure of operating cash flow is reported as non-GAAP operating results, which approximates our cash flow from operations before working capital changes. Non-GAAP operating results is defined as our GAAP operating results adjusted for noncash items including equity compensation, depreciation and amortization and any other unusual items such as restructuring charges. In the third quarter, we generated non-GAAP operating income of $13 million, an improvement from a loss of $16.2 million in the third quarter of 2010. Total revenues in the third quarter were $175 million, a 12.1% increase compared to $156.1 million in the third quarter of 2010. The increase primarily reflects the $15 million milestone we earned upon the European launch of BYDUREON in July. Net product sales in the third quarter were $155.1 million, a slight increase from $154 million in the third quarter of 2010. Our gross margins remained strong at 92%. Our operating expenses were $109.6 million in the third quarter, consisting of $63 million of selling, general and administrative expenses and $46.6 million of research and development expenses. This represents an overall $11.6 million or 9.6% reduction from $121.2 million in the same quarter of last year. This decrease reflects our continued focus on driving efficiencies across our business. For further details regarding our financial results reported today, please refer to the presentation available in the Investors section of our company website. I\'d like to make a few additional comments comparing the third quarter of 2011 sequentially to the second quarter of 2011. BYETTA sales were down $0.9 million sequentially or 0.7%. The slight decrease in revenue was driven by a 4.5% decline in prescription volume, largely offset by the full quarterly impact of pricing actions during the second quarter. SYMLIN sales were up $1.2 million or 4.7% sequentially. The revenue growth seen with SYMLIN was driven by the full quarterly impact of second quarter pricing actions partially offset by a slight decline in pen prescription volume of 0.2%. Vince will discuss BYETTA and SYMLIN prescription trends in more detail later in the call. Wholesaler inventories of September 30 were comparable to those of June 30 and we believe are consistent with patient demand. Our non-GAAP operating income was $13 million for the third quarter compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of $1.7 million in the second quarter. I\'ll now quickly review top and bottom line results for the first 9 months of 2011. Total revenues for the first 9 months of the year were $485.7 million, a 1.8% decrease from $494.6 million in the same period of 2010. Non-GAAP operating results improved the income of $8.2 million from a loss of $27.3 million for same period last year. In late 2008, we established a plan to manage expenses in line with revenues, and we continue to deliver results that reflect the operational discipline. In fact, since the beginning of 2010, we have essentially been running slightly above operating cash flow breakeven with accumulative non-GAAP operating income of approximately $5 million during those 7 quarters. Our plans for managing expenses have also placed substantial emphasis on cash preservation, and we ended September in a strong financial position with $461 million in cash, short-term investments and restricted cash. Net of financing activities in the second quarter related to the $200 million convertible note maturity and the $165 million drawdown of a loan from Eli Lilly and Company, our cash balance has increased by approximately $38 million year-to-date. As we progress towards the end of the year, our focus remains on managing our business close to cash flow neutral and conserving our cash balance. For full details of our financial results, please refer to the press release we issued earlier today. I\'d now like to provide an update regarding key trends and assumptions for the remainder of 2011. Entering 2011, we guided that the normalized run rate for our quarterly GAAP operating expenses was between $110 million and $115 million and that this level will decline during the year. Year-to-date, our spending has been at or below the low end of this range, and we expect comparable expense levels in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP operating results continue to be the key metric we use to measure our financial performance. We expect our non-GAAP operating results to be close to breakeven for the year. Strong product revenues and gross margins and our continued focus on expense management have enabled us to improve from our original guidance of a $25 million to $40 million loss. We continue to expect that exenatide royalties, which are tiered and based on exenatide gross profits outside the U.S. will be less than $5 million for the year. We remain confident that we will be able to maintain strong combined gross margins from BYETTA and SYMLIN of over 90%. We will also continue to expect net interest expense to be $25 million to $30 million. Consistent with our most recent guidance, we expect noncash adjustments, including depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, to be approximately $85 million to $90 million for 2011. To summarize, our third quarter results are a direct result of our ongoing efforts to achieve additional efficiencies in our business and preserve cash. As we look to the future, we will opportunistically manage our financial risk with a focus on maximizing shareholder value. Now I will turn the call over to Vince to review our commercial activities. Vincent P. Mihalik Thank you, Mark. The Amylin sales and marketing organization continues to remain focused on our day-to-day business, driving revenue for our currently marketed products BYETTA and SYMLIN, and preparing for the launch of BYDUREON in the United States. With BYDUREON available in the United Kingdom and now in Germany, we are leveraging the opportunity to monitor the early stages of these launches. While it\'s still too early to get a clear read on the prescribing trends and other market dynamics, initial demand in the wholesale channels has been very encouraging and we look forward to providing additional updates on these and other launches outside the United States as they occur. In addition to being encouraged by the progress of the ongoing launches in Europe, we were pleased to see on Monday evening that the National Institute of Clinical Health and Excellence or NICE, the government agency in the United Kingdom that overseas reimbursement of medications, issued a preliminary recommendation to reimburse BYDUREON when used in combination with metformin and either a TZD or a sulfonylurea. We believe that this preliminary recommendation reflects the value delivered to the health care system by BYDUREON and look forward to the final recommendation from NICE probably in February of next year. Moving on to the third quarter performance for BYETTA. Sales decreased approximately 1% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in sales was generally in line with a 4.5% decline in prescription volume partially offset by pricing actions during the second quarter. Since the launch of the second daily-dose GLP-1 receptor agonist in February of last year, 4-week moving averages indicate that the total weekly prescriptions for GLP-1 receptor agonist have grown by approximately 38%. In terms of sales, the class is on a run rate of greater than $1 billion in the United States this year. As BYETTA continues to effectively compete in the market, our managed markets team has been working to drive broader access with managed care plans. We continue to maintain greater-than-80% Tier 2 coverage for BYETTA, a key strategic advantage in today\'s value-focused healthcare industry. These 2 indicators point to the growing recognition of the benefits delivered by GLP-1 therapy, and we are extremely enthusiastic about having the opportunity to launch BYDUREON into a growing class supported by a growing body of clinical and real-world data. While we are encouraged by the fact that the GLP-1 class in the United States continues to grow and believe this is a clear sign that the market is willing to adopt new entrants, we also believe the class has enormous potential to continue its growth. As such, one of the key areas of focus of our sales and marketing organization has been on driving additional adoption of BYETTA by both patients and physicians who have not yet experienced the benefits of GLP-1 therapy. In support of these efforts, we are fully prepared to begin promoting BYETTA for use in combination with insulin glargine if we receive regulatory approval by our PDUFA date, which is October 22. Based on the data we\'ve seen to date, we are very excited to have the opportunity to make BYETTA available to millions of insulin glargine users here in the United States, with the potential to provide outstanding post-meal glucose and help insulin glargine-using patients achieve a lower fasting plasma glucose levels and improve their hemoglobin A1C percent relative to patients using insulin glargine alone. We believe this potential new indication for BYETTA could provide a compelling addition to the choices available to both patients and physicians. Indeed, the pairing of insulin glargine with BYETTA would seem to be almost the perfect synergistic partnership, with clinical studies demonstrating a low risk for hypoglycemia and the potential for weight loss in addition to powerful glucose control. At Amylin, we believe the GLP-1 class has the potential to evolve in a manner that it almost mirrors the evolution of the insulin market with short-acting mealtime agents and longer-acting basal agents. As the role of GLP-1 therapy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes expands, we are uniquely positioned to deliver value to a broad segment of type 2 patients with the exenatide franchise. From uses of monotherapy to the potential use in patients using the most popular basal insulin, BYETTA is placed to have the broadest label in the GLP-1 class and set the standard for short-acting mealtime GLP-1 therapy. The unique short-acting pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic profile of BYETTA makes it the most suitable GLP-1 receptor agonist for use as a postprandial glucose management therapy. At the longer-acting end of the spectrum of GLP-1 therapy, BYDUREON and the exenatide suspension programs offer the potential for the first weekly and monthly dose to GLP-1 agents and the exceptional convenience to reduce dosing frequency the market research data suggest type 2 diabetes patients and healthcare providers prefer. Now let\'s move on to SYMLIN, the first and only FDA-approved Amylin analog. With regard to SYMLIN, as Mark mentioned earlier, SYMLIN revenues increased by approximately 4.6% during the quarter. The revenue growth seen with SYMLIN was driven by pricing actions during the second quarter, partially offset by a modest decrease in prescriptions of 0.2%. We expect to continue to convert our vial business to pens as we execute on our overall SYMLIN plans. Let me close my portion of the remarks by saying that we are pleased with the resiliency BYETTA has demonstrated in the face of competition. With its well-established safety profile, efficacy and favorable market access, we continue to be confident that BYETTA remains a competitive choice. Also, as we eagerly await a regulatory decision on BYETTA plus insulin glargine indication, we continue to build enthusiasm for the GLP-1 class and the potential it has to change the way diabetes is treated. With BYETTA being the only 2 short-acting GLP-1 therapy available in the market and with BYDUREON having the potential to be the first weekly dose therapy for type 2 diabetes, we believe that Amylin is in excellent position to drive the continued evolution of the GLP-1 market. I\'ll now turn the call back over to Dan for a few additional thoughts. Dan Bradbury Thanks, Vince. Before the close of our prepared remarks, I\'d like to reinforce some of the comments made by Mark and Vince by noting that with BYETTA continuing to perform well in the market and our business running at cash flow breakeven, we have the resources necessary to successfully launch and drive adoption of BYDUREON in the United States. In closing, I\'d like to reiterate that I, along with the Amylin leadership team, remain committed to creating value for our shareholders, our employees and, most importantly, the millions of diabetes patients we\'re focused on serving. I will now ask the operator to open the lines for questions. Operator [Operator Instructions] Dan Bradbury Actually, before we start on the questions, before we open the lines for questions, I wanted to share some exciting late breaking news. We just received word that the FDA has approved BYETTA for use with insulin glargine in the U.S. That means that BYETTA is now approved as an add-on therapy to insulin glargine with or without metformin and/or a thiazolidinedione in conjunction with diet and exercise for adults with type 2 diabetes who are not achieving adequate glycemic control on insulin glargine alone. We believe this complementary approach to glycemic control will be a smart partnership that could result in an important new treatment option for patients. We will be issuing a press release with our partner Lilly later this afternoon that will provide you with more information. And now, I think we\'re ready to take some questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Our first question will come from Ian Somaiya of Piper Jaffray. M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division I had a couple of questions. So given the late breaking news, why don\'t we start there? Can you just give us a sense of how promiscuous the U.S. is with BYETTA in combination with insulin glargine and how you can take advantage of the label claim? And the second question I had was on BYDUREON, just the early experience in Europe, if you could share with us the rate of early dropouts? And this is obviously quite common with BYETTA, whether it\'s associated with the lack of weight loss or because of the GI intolerance, I was just wondering if you can share with us the experience with BYDUREON in Europe. Dan Bradbury Okay, well thanks for your question, Ian. With regard to the late breaking news regarding the approval of BYETTA for use with insulin glargine in the United States, I\'ll ask Vince to comment on that in a second. With regards to BYDUREON early experience in Europe, I think it\'s too early for us to provide much guidance with regards to persistency data there. What we do know, of course, is that in the clinical program that\'s been done with BYDUREON, there was a very much reduced rate of people dropping out of the studies, particularly dropping out as associated with GI events. So we expect that to translate into the marketplace. But maybe, Vince, you could comment on the new late breaking news regarding on new label claim for BYETTA? Vincent P. Mihalik Thanks, Dan. And in fact, Ian, thanks very much for the question. Obviously, this was all part of our life cycle plan to broaden the applications for the exenatide molecule by having both short-acting and long-acting GLP-1s. And for this expanded use, BYETTA does provide a complementary addition to glargine, the most popular basal insulin therapy. To the first part of your question, how much usage, actually, estimates we\'ve been able to make are probably less than 20% of BYETTA use is on top of basal insulin of any kind. So we think there\'s a real nice opportunity for BYETTA to demonstrate the power of short-acting GLP-1s on postprandials as a mealtime treatment option instead of rapid-acting insulin or as many physicians do increase the dosage of glargine. And keep in mind, it\'s only taken twice a day and doesn\'t require any dosing titration at all for the mealtime component. And as Dan commented, it\'s a very smart partnership that does provide realtime postprandial control to improve the overall blood sugars with little potential for weight gain or hypoglycemia. So if you think about the opportunity as the number of patients that are on glargine today that aren\'t adequately controlled on basal insulin, keep in mind that roughly about 60% of type 2 patients don\'t meet target. There\'s a really nice opportunity out there for us to have this new indication and be able to promote it as for use with the most popular basal insulin, which is glargine. Dan Bradbury Thanks, Vince. Operator Our next question will come from Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Group. Salim Syed This is Salim, stepping in for Mark. A couple of questions. You mentioned that you have a good feeling from the EU in terms of BYDUREON. But in terms of talks with the FDA and BYDUREON, how is that impacting your thinking around launch after approval? I know you said "short," but exactly what does that mean? And then in terms of inventory, how much are you planning to build BYDUREON? And the second question is around revenue guidance. Obviously you now have BYETTA plus insulin, are you contemplating giving revenue guidance at some point in time? Dan Bradbury Thanks for the questions, I appreciate it. Just regarding where we are with BYDUREON, well as I commented in the remarks, so we obviously, we submitted the response with regards to the second complete response in July this year. And we\'ve got -- received from the FDA in August a confirmation that they had filed that response and they issued a PDUFA date of the 28th of January for next year. We continue to have interactions with the agency, and I guess the best thing that I could say to you at this point is that we\'re not aware of any other additional issues that have been raised by the agency and that the review remains on track. Regarding how quickly, post-approval, we\'d be able to launch, I think I\'ll stick with "shortly" as regards to guidance at this point. That\'s highly dependent upon what information we get from the agency when. The critical component for us to learn early is regards to agreement on the label and, in particular, also the medication guide. Once we have those, we can actually start building a finished-product inventory immediately. That doesn\'t take that long and hence the comment "shortly." That having said, your question with regards to ability to build inventory, obviously we have the facility that we completed in Ohio, that\'s now manufacturing for Europe for commercial product. And I would just say that we have plenty of adequate material in terms of pre-finished product that can become finished product very quickly upon approval. Your second question is relating to revenue guidance: It has not been our standard practice to provide revenue guidance, and we don\'t intend to change that practice at this point. Operator Our next question will come from Catherine Arnold of Crédit Suisse. Catherine J. Arnold - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division I wanted to ask you guys if you can just give me an update in terms of the dual-chamber pen filing and where that stands. And then also, is -- are there any milestones in your legal dispute with Lilly that come before the FDA action date for BYDUREON? Dan Bradbury Catherine, Dan here. I guess I\'ll take both of those questions. Thanks very much. The -- with regards to the first question, we are continuing to guide that we expect that the dual-chamber pen for BYDUREON will be available at the end of 2012, beginning of 2013, subject to regulatory review time. With regard to update on our litigation with Lilly, that litigation -- I guess just a couple of points I\'d want to make. First and foremost, I think it\'s important that everybody is aware of the fact that we do have in place with Lilly a business-as-usual arrangement while the litigation is continuing. That enables both companies to continue to focus on maximizing the value of exenatide. Secondly, it is fairly complicated, there\'s a number of things that are occurring. And if I could request, Catherine, rather than me going into all the detail on this call, that if you wouldn\'t mind calling our investor relations group. They can give you an update of the -- of all the dates and everything with regards to the ongoing litigation with precision. Catherine J. Arnold - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division Sure. Dan, could you just -- going back to the filing for the dual-chamber pen, I don\'t know if you specified exactly what you\'d expect the time line you said directionally when you expect it to be available, but you must be getting close, I would think, to preparing that filing. Dan Bradbury Yes, we are. We haven\'t provided precise guidance with regards to exactly when we are going to submit. But obviously if I\'m guiding towards -- I\'m guiding at the end of next year and beginning of 2013, you would expect that our submission would occur in the early part of 2012. Catherine J. Arnold - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division And then can I ask you one more follow-up? Which is, in your experience in your -- as you\'re rolling out, I know Lilly is managing the launches in Europe, but you had made a comment that you\'ll be taking insights from that progress. What markets in Europe are you watching most carefully? Dan Bradbury Well what I\'ll do there, Catherine, is I\'ll ask Vince to give you some details with regards to our activities there. Vince, do you want to provide some insight there? Vincent P. Mihalik Sure, Dan. Catherine, first and foremost, we have launched in the U.K. in July, and towards the end of August, beginning of September, we launched into Germany and only mentioned the big 5. Obviously, still have -- ahead of Spain, France and Italy launches to go. BYDUREON is off to a great start in Germany. We\'ve seen a very nicely weekly share of market increases in the GLP-1 space with uptake for BYDUREON being very good with minimal erosion of BYETTA, so a net growth for exenatide in share of market. In the U.K., we\'re seeing -- we\'re getting access pretty quickly from some of the public trusts. They\'re clearing about twice as fast as they did for Victoza, so we\'re seeing a nice uptake there. And of course, you probably saw earlier this week that in the U.K. we did get a preliminary recommendation from NICE, which is of course subject to public comment and final view, but it\'s an important step towards reimbursement in the U.K. So we\'re pretty pleased with what\'s happening so far. It\'s a relief. And obviously, data takes a little bit longer to come from Europe than it does in the United States. But overall, we\'re monitoring the major countries in the EU for what happens with launch uptake and we\'re going to apply those learnings we pick up to fine-tune our U.S. launch. We\'re very pleased with our plans so far, but it\'s a great opportunity to fine-tune. Operator Our next question will come from Thomas Wei of Jefferies. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division Just wanted to ask a little bit more on the European launch, actually just to follow up on the last answer. Do you think that, that same trend of not seeing very much BYETTA share erosion after the BYDUREON launch is indicative of your expectations of how things will go in the U.S.? Dan Bradbury Vince, you want to comment? Vincent P. Mihalik Okay. Thanks, Thomas. Yes actually, given the fact that Victoza launched in Europe first, and obviously the people are interested in more longer-acting GLP-1s who weren\'t looking for so much the postprandial effects. We did see the acceptance of, I\'ll say, the more convenient dosing. I do expect that when BYDUREON launches, that there will be more of an impact on Victoza share that on the BYETTA share. We expect some erosion, of course, from BYETTA but most of it, I think, will be remains since a lot of it, I think, is on the postprandial effect that BYETTA has. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division And when you say that demand in the wholesaler channel so far looks robust in Europe, can you give us a relative comparison about how that wholesaler demand looks relative to a comparable time point when BYETTA was launched in those same markets? Is it tracking ahead of how BYETTA was doing? Vincent P. Mihalik So Thomas, just a follow-up. I haven\'t actually gone back and made the comparison, but I would expect it to be very similar if not better. And the only reason I make that comment is, of course, uptake in Europe for wholesalers is a bit different than in the United States. The pharmacies tend to do -- order when they have a script as opposed to stocking. But I would expect that the uptake is pretty similar. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division And then just lastly, when you talked about metreleptin and the complexities that you ran into in the manufacturing runs, can you just give us a little bit more elaboration and some comfort that those issues are behind you? Dan Bradbury Yes, Thomas, I\'ll take that one. So Thomas, I mean, just to say that this is a fairly typical -- it\'s fairly typical issue that we dealt with that is often found when manufacturing large macromolecules such as metreleptin. And it was something that we encountered during the first validation run. It was -- clearly, it was a process tweak that needed to be undertaken. That process tweak was undertaken and we then subsequently have now completed the validation runs. And as you know, you have to do 3 validation runs, and the product is on stability. So we\'ve solved the technical issue and so we remain confident moving forward with regards to the submission of the CMC section for metreleptin and, I think, just to say that we remain very committed to making sure that happens, given the higher medical need in the patient population that we\'re hoping to serve. Operator Our next question will come from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Unknown Analyst -  It\'s Alethea [ph] for Robyn. But I just wanted to get a little bit more color on the market opportunity in EU, maybe particularly into emerging Europe. Do you have any plans to expand there? And what happens once you get post the big 5? Vincent P. Mihalik Yes [indiscernible] you or me in terms of the [indiscernible]. So yes, in the emerging markets, we do have plans to launch in a lot of the countries in the emerging markets and of course in Eastern Europe as well. In fact, we\'ve already launched in Romania, just as an example. So yes, that\'s part of our plans. We didn\'t disclose any of our launch dates, but we clearly have plans to do that. Unknown Analyst -  And do you think the uptick for doctors will be the same in that part of -- in the emerging countries as in the big 5 developed markets? Vincent P. Mihalik Well in volume, probably not, obviously. But I do expect that we are seeing very nice GLP-1 growth all across Europe. In fact, if you look at, I\'ll take the big 5, just the ones we keep track of more closely, we\'re seeing about a 67% growth for GLP-1s in that space. And in fact, as I speak, we\'re trending towards probably $1.5 billion to $2 billion globally for GLP-1. So it\'s a robust market, it\'s growing. You\'re seeing additional growth in adoption by physicians. And I think, since the entrance of the second GLP-1 agonist, I think doctors are really beginning to see the unique benefits of GLP-1 therapy against other classes. They\'re looking at the convenience, the better tolerability, and I think all of that bodes very well for BYDUREON. Operator Our next question will come from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Cory William Kasimov - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division I have 2 of them for you. First of all, for your BYETTA plus Lantus or glargine indication, can you discuss how this market opportunity might potentially change if and when Lantus is ultimately combined with Sanofi\'s proprietary GLP-1? And then my second question is relates to BYDUREON and post-EASD and now with BYDUREON available in Europe, are you able to comment on the impact DURATION-6 has had on physician sentiment, if it has had any impact at all? Dan Bradbury Cory, maybe I\'ll take the first question and then I\'ll ask Vince to comment with regards to D-6. So I think it\'s a little bit premature to comment about what may or may not happen with regards to lixisenatide in combination with glargine. My read on that situation has been that, that program has remained in early stage development and continues to be there. So until such time as we really know what the product is that we would be competing against, I think it\'s premature for us to comment about what may or may not be the impact of it. Perhaps, Vince, you could talk about the situation in Europe? You were at the EASD meeting, so perhaps you could comment about your impressions. Vincent P. Mihalik Yes. Thanks, Dan. So yes, being at the EASD was really a very nice experience for me because I did get to see physicians and healthcare providers react to BYDUREON at the Lilly booth. It was great to see the reactions that they had both to the efficacy and safety data as well as to the custom dosing kit. First and foremost, on the efficacy and safety, DURATION-6 is actually probably one of the lower hemoglobin A1C reductions we saw across the continuum. And when you show the doctors the full, I\'d say, composite of all of the different studies and all of the different reductions in hemoglobin A1C, you see the very positive effect it has on hemoglobin A1C and the efficacy. Doctors were very pleased with the better tolerability you see with BYDUREON versus BYETTA or Victoza. And I would also say that they were very pleased with the custom dosing kit. In fact, several -- I watched several different doctors go through the experience, and many of them said it was easy and very straightforward and their patients can do this. Even if it takes 10 minutes, they could do it for once a week. So it was a really good, positive experience. It fits with what we were trying to achieve with the -- many of those strategies that they use in Europe actually were the beginnings of work that was done here for the U.S. launch so it reinforced what we were hoping to see and the expectations we had around the full complement of studies that we have on BYDUREON with the DURATION series. Cory William Kasimov - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Okay, that\'s helpful. And Vince, just a follow-up for you, if I might. When -- using a couple of comments you made earlier with regard to expectations for more switching once BYDUREON is available in the U.S., more switching from Victoza than from BYETTA, but can you talk about your expectations for switching from patients who are on existing GLP-1s versus just new GLP-1 starts? That would -- do you expect more of the patients to come from just new starts overall that would grow the overall market? Or is it, at least initially, more switching? Vincent P. Mihalik So Cory, I am expecting more, I\'ll say, new patient starts. I think the profile that BYDUREON has is much more attractive, given that it\'s delivered once a week. It\'s a first in class, once-a-week medicine we\'ve never seen before in terms of treating diabetes. I think it\'s a real opportunity to really make a difference for patients with diabetes. And so some of the ones struggling today on orals that have in the past not been comfortable necessarily going to an injection, I think once a week\'s going to make a big difference for them. We will see some switching from GLP-1s, don\'t get me wrong, but I do believe the greatest opportunity is for new patient starts. Operator Our next question will come from Kumar Raja of Citigroup. Kumaraguru Raja I\'m stepping in for Yaron Werber. We have been seeing that the scripts have been going down for BYETTA. How can we see the sales going forward? And also for BYDUREON, how can we look in terms of expenses? Dan Bradbury Kumar, it\'s Dan. So maybe I could just take the first question with regards to prescriptions for BYETTA. Yes, they have declined. However, I don\'t think the decline is certainly to the extent that, perhaps maybe many were expecting. And as you saw from sales, you are seeing actually consistent sales quarter-on-quarter over the last 3 quarters. So I think we\'re continuing to see good sales of BYETTA, and we don\'t expect to see dramatic reductions in sales of BYETTA in the near term. With respect to your second question, with regards to BYDUREON launch cost, perhaps, Mark, you could comment with regards to our expectation there? Mark G. Foletta Sure, Dan, thanks for the question. I think we\'ve been speaking consistently about our plans for this. And really, it\'s important to understand that the operating model that we\'ve put in place really worked hard over the last few years, is really the model that was prepared to launch BYDUREON. And that\'s both our sales and marketing efforts and of course our R&D efforts. So while we do expect incremental monitoring cost to support the launch of BYDUREON, we do not anticipate significant other increases in expenses. Of course as we monitor the launch, and we will look to make investments that we believe can drive growth. We will not under-support this launch, I want to make that clear, but we do not anticipate significant changes in our operating model to enable that launch. Kumaraguru Raja If I may ask, does this take into consideration the litigation with Lilly? Mark G. Foletta I\'m sorry, could you repeat that? Kumaraguru Raja Does these plans take into consideration the litigation with Lilly? Mark G. Foletta Yes, yes. I mean, I\'ll just refer back to Dan\'s earlier comment about the business-as-usual agreement. And certainly, we believe that, between Amylin and Lilly, that we have adequate support for this launch. I\'d -- one additional comment that I\'d like to make is that I will remind you that we do earn a $40 million milestone on the approval of BYDUREON in the United States or the launch of BYDUREON in the United States and so obviously, that can support some of the incremental launch costs that we\'ve referred to. Operator Our next question will come from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Just first in terms of Germany, I wanted to understand the trends you\'re seeing. Are you seeing mostly new patient starts, or are you seeing any switching from Victoza? And then, a follow-up on pricing. Dan Bradbury Terence, I\'m going to toss that to Vince to answer that. Vincent P. Mihalik Thanks. I think it was Aaron? Dan Bradbury Terrence. Vincent P. Mihalik Terrence, sorry. Terrence, thank you for the question. Actually, we are seeing some erosion of Victoza and we are getting new patient starts, so it\'s a mixture. It\'s a very early data, though, so it\'s hard to say where that\'s actually going to end up. We\'re pleased with what we see so far and the fact that, as I commented, we\'re seeing very nice -- we\'re off to a nice weekly share of market start in Germany. And it\'s been a net growth for exenatide in terms of share of market. So overall, we\'re pleased with the start. Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division And then on the pricing front, can you give us any sense where -- how pricing has come in, in the U.K. and Germany relative to BYETTA and Victoza? And then the payments that the patients have to make out-of-pocket, particularly in Germany, are those comparable across all 3 drugs, or are there any differences there? Vincent P. Mihalik So Dan, I\'ll take this question, if it\'s okay with you. I do have the German information. Obviously, really there\'s the pricing in the U.K. and Germany. I can\'t comment on out-of-pocket cost. I don\'t know that off the top of my head, Terrence, so we\'ll have to get that for you. But in Germany, the price for BYDUREON was set pretty much at the -- at a premium, a slight premium to BYETTA but equivalent to the Victoza, I would say, the 1.2-milligram dose. Between the 1.2-milligram dose and the 1.8, the 1.2 in Germany is about the same price as BYETTA, so there\'s a slight premium to that but less than the 1.8-milligram dose. And in the U.K., it\'s a very similar pricing arrangement. Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Okay. And then if I may, just one quick question on BYDUREON in the U.S. In terms of your conversations with FDA, have they mentioned at all you guys contributing to this MTC registry that Novo has to set up for or is running currently for Victoza in terms of tracking patients over 15 years? And if you do get approval, do you expect that\'s something that you will have to do as well? Dan Bradbury Terence, it\'s Dan here. Yes, Terence, I mean I think we expect, just like anybody else developing a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist, that we would need to participate in a runs [ph] program, which would encompass tracking in the same way that Novo has to with definitely regards that issue. Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Okay, so you have talked to them about this? Dan Bradbury Yes. I mean by the way, we had -- before we had the second complete response letter, we\'d had extensive discussions with the agency. And we have, I think, consistently said we expect to be treated in a similar manner at this time. Obviously, this is all subject to final discussions with the agency and the final label and approval. Operator Our next question will come from David Friedman of Morgan Stanley. David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Just in relation to the U.S., your pricing strategy across your products and your formulary status. Given that you\'ve taken a couple larger price increases for BYETTA than historically and your price delta is getting closer to Victoza and given that you\'ve consistently wanted to maintain a good Tier 2 formulary status, how do you view sort of your price increase strategy and how you\'re thinking of BYETTA with regards to how you\'re going to try to maintain good Tier 2 formulary access? Or is one of those variables going to take a backseat? Dan Bradbury Well, let -- maybe I should comment on that, David. So let me just say that fundamentally, we believe that it\'s really important to maximize access to as many patients as possible for our products, and we continue to be committed to that. I think there is -- perhaps one thing I would like to say is that what your comment there with regards to the delta with Victoza, I think that\'s actually been maintained pretty consistent as a result of also price increases that have occurred to Victoza as well. Going forward, at this point, we\'re not in a position to guide with regards to our pricing strategy to BYDUREON, but I would reiterate comments that I\'ve made previously that we are committed to ensuring that BYDUREON is available and there is good access to patients with -- at a low tier for BYDUREON going forward. David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division And then just a quick follow-up, if I could. Has there been any change in the formulary status of BYETTA with the recent price changes? Or has that been stable? Dan Bradbury It\'s been very stable. Operator Our next question will come from Richard Resnick [ph] of William Blair. Unknown Analyst -  This is Rich Resnick [ph] for John Sonnier. Regarding the pipeline, I have 2 questions. The first is for the EXSCEL trial. I know it doesn\'t read out for a couple of years, but is there any interim date that you guys might have? And if so, could you say what would be and when it might read out? And then the second question is about AC165198. I just wanted to see if the IND and Phase I is still on track for year end and if you had anything more than you wanted to say about that? Dan Bradbury Yes, sure, thanks for both those questions. Certainly with regards to EXSCEL, at this time there are no plans to do an interim analysis. That\'s always an option for at some point in the future. But at this time, there are no plans to do an interim analysis of that. With regards to AC165198, yes, it remains on track to file an IND by the end of this year. Operator Our next question will come from Ian Somaiya of Piper Jaffray. M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Sorry, one quick follow-up for you. Have you been able to track the patients who are getting BYDUREON in Europe? Just some sense that do they have any prior experience with BYETTA? I think you mentioned there\'s some cannibalization of Victoza, so I\'m just curious whether these patients ever tried BYETTA. Dan Bradbury Ian, yes, it\'s a good question. I don\'t believe we have that kind of granularity of nature at this time and so it\'s too early for us to comment on that. Operator We have no further questions at this time. Dan Bradbury Okay. Well thanks, everybody. Thanks for your interest and for your questions. I appreciate them. Here at Amylin, we know we have a huge opportunity to continue to advance our mission of discovering, developing and commercializing medicines to improve the lives of patients. And our leadership team and the many dedicated employees of Amylin remain focused on building the business today and laying the necessary foundation for our success in the future. If you have any additional questions regarding the call today or any other aspect of our business, please call Michael or Jeff on our -- at our IR team.

Thank you!', 'qAndAText': 'Operator Our first question will come from Ian Somaiya of Piper Jaffray. M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division I had a couple of questions. So given the late breaking news, why don\'t we start there? Can you just give us a sense of how promiscuous the U.S. is with BYETTA in combination with insulin glargine and how you can take advantage of the label claim? And the second question I had was on BYDUREON, just the early experience in Europe, if you could share with us the rate of early dropouts? And this is obviously quite common with BYETTA, whether it\'s associated with the lack of weight loss or because of the GI intolerance, I was just wondering if you can share with us the experience with BYDUREON in Europe. Dan Bradbury Okay, well thanks for your question, Ian. With regard to the late breaking news regarding the approval of BYETTA for use with insulin glargine in the United States, I\'ll ask Vince to comment on that in a second. With regards to BYDUREON early experience in Europe, I think it\'s too early for us to provide much guidance with regards to persistency data there. What we do know, of course, is that in the clinical program that\'s been done with BYDUREON, there was a very much reduced rate of people dropping out of the studies, particularly dropping out as associated with GI events. So we expect that to translate into the marketplace. But maybe, Vince, you could comment on the new late breaking news regarding on new label claim for BYETTA? Vincent P. Mihalik Thanks, Dan. And in fact, Ian, thanks very much for the question. Obviously, this was all part of our life cycle plan to broaden the applications for the exenatide molecule by having both short-acting and long-acting GLP-1s. And for this expanded use, BYETTA does provide a complementary addition to glargine, the most popular basal insulin therapy. To the first part of your question, how much usage, actually, estimates we\'ve been able to make are probably less than 20% of BYETTA use is on top of basal insulin of any kind. So we think there\'s a real nice opportunity for BYETTA to demonstrate the power of short-acting GLP-1s on postprandials as a mealtime treatment option instead of rapid-acting insulin or as many physicians do increase the dosage of glargine. And keep in mind, it\'s only taken twice a day and doesn\'t require any dosing titration at all for the mealtime component. And as Dan commented, it\'s a very smart partnership that does provide realtime postprandial control to improve the overall blood sugars with little potential for weight gain or hypoglycemia. So if you think about the opportunity as the number of patients that are on glargine today that aren\'t adequately controlled on basal insulin, keep in mind that roughly about 60% of type 2 patients don\'t meet target. There\'s a really nice opportunity out there for us to have this new indication and be able to promote it as for use with the most popular basal insulin, which is glargine. Dan Bradbury Thanks, Vince. Operator Our next question will come from Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Group. Salim Syed This is Salim, stepping in for Mark. A couple of questions. You mentioned that you have a good feeling from the EU in terms of BYDUREON. But in terms of talks with the FDA and BYDUREON, how is that impacting your thinking around launch after approval? I know you said "short," but exactly what does that mean? And then in terms of inventory, how much are you planning to build BYDUREON? And the second question is around revenue guidance. Obviously you now have BYETTA plus insulin, are you contemplating giving revenue guidance at some point in time? Dan Bradbury Thanks for the questions, I appreciate it. Just regarding where we are with BYDUREON, well as I commented in the remarks, so we obviously, we submitted the response with regards to the second complete response in July this year. And we\'ve got -- received from the FDA in August a confirmation that they had filed that response and they issued a PDUFA date of the 28th of January for next year. We continue to have interactions with the agency, and I guess the best thing that I could say to you at this point is that we\'re not aware of any other additional issues that have been raised by the agency and that the review remains on track. Regarding how quickly, post-approval, we\'d be able to launch, I think I\'ll stick with "shortly" as regards to guidance at this point. That\'s highly dependent upon what information we get from the agency when. The critical component for us to learn early is regards to agreement on the label and, in particular, also the medication guide. Once we have those, we can actually start building a finished-product inventory immediately. That doesn\'t take that long and hence the comment "shortly." That having said, your question with regards to ability to build inventory, obviously we have the facility that we completed in Ohio, that\'s now manufacturing for Europe for commercial product. And I would just say that we have plenty of adequate material in terms of pre-finished product that can become finished product very quickly upon approval. Your second question is relating to revenue guidance: It has not been our standard practice to provide revenue guidance, and we don\'t intend to change that practice at this point. Operator Our next question will come from Catherine Arnold of Crédit Suisse. Catherine J. Arnold - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division I wanted to ask you guys if you can just give me an update in terms of the dual-chamber pen filing and where that stands. And then also, is -- are there any milestones in your legal dispute with Lilly that come before the FDA action date for BYDUREON? Dan Bradbury Catherine, Dan here. I guess I\'ll take both of those questions. Thanks very much. The -- with regards to the first question, we are continuing to guide that we expect that the dual-chamber pen for BYDUREON will be available at the end of 2012, beginning of 2013, subject to regulatory review time. With regard to update on our litigation with Lilly, that litigation -- I guess just a couple of points I\'d want to make. First and foremost, I think it\'s important that everybody is aware of the fact that we do have in place with Lilly a business-as-usual arrangement while the litigation is continuing. That enables both companies to continue to focus on maximizing the value of exenatide. Secondly, it is fairly complicated, there\'s a number of things that are occurring. And if I could request, Catherine, rather than me going into all the detail on this call, that if you wouldn\'t mind calling our investor relations group. They can give you an update of the -- of all the dates and everything with regards to the ongoing litigation with precision. Catherine J. Arnold - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division Sure. Dan, could you just -- going back to the filing for the dual-chamber pen, I don\'t know if you specified exactly what you\'d expect the time line you said directionally when you expect it to be available, but you must be getting close, I would think, to preparing that filing. Dan Bradbury Yes, we are. We haven\'t provided precise guidance with regards to exactly when we are going to submit. But obviously if I\'m guiding towards -- I\'m guiding at the end of next year and beginning of 2013, you would expect that our submission would occur in the early part of 2012. Catherine J. Arnold - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division And then can I ask you one more follow-up? Which is, in your experience in your -- as you\'re rolling out, I know Lilly is managing the launches in Europe, but you had made a comment that you\'ll be taking insights from that progress. What markets in Europe are you watching most carefully? Dan Bradbury Well what I\'ll do there, Catherine, is I\'ll ask Vince to give you some details with regards to our activities there. Vince, do you want to provide some insight there? Vincent P. Mihalik Sure, Dan. Catherine, first and foremost, we have launched in the U.K. in July, and towards the end of August, beginning of September, we launched into Germany and only mentioned the big 5. Obviously, still have -- ahead of Spain, France and Italy launches to go. BYDUREON is off to a great start in Germany. We\'ve seen a very nicely weekly share of market increases in the GLP-1 space with uptake for BYDUREON being very good with minimal erosion of BYETTA, so a net growth for exenatide in share of market. In the U.K., we\'re seeing -- we\'re getting access pretty quickly from some of the public trusts. They\'re clearing about twice as fast as they did for Victoza, so we\'re seeing a nice uptake there. And of course, you probably saw earlier this week that in the U.K. we did get a preliminary recommendation from NICE, which is of course subject to public comment and final view, but it\'s an important step towards reimbursement in the U.K. So we\'re pretty pleased with what\'s happening so far. It\'s a relief. And obviously, data takes a little bit longer to come from Europe than it does in the United States. But overall, we\'re monitoring the major countries in the EU for what happens with launch uptake and we\'re going to apply those learnings we pick up to fine-tune our U.S. launch. We\'re very pleased with our plans so far, but it\'s a great opportunity to fine-tune. Operator Our next question will come from Thomas Wei of Jefferies. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division Just wanted to ask a little bit more on the European launch, actually just to follow up on the last answer. Do you think that, that same trend of not seeing very much BYETTA share erosion after the BYDUREON launch is indicative of your expectations of how things will go in the U.S.? Dan Bradbury Vince, you want to comment? Vincent P. Mihalik Okay. Thanks, Thomas. Yes actually, given the fact that Victoza launched in Europe first, and obviously the people are interested in more longer-acting GLP-1s who weren\'t looking for so much the postprandial effects. We did see the acceptance of, I\'ll say, the more convenient dosing. I do expect that when BYDUREON launches, that there will be more of an impact on Victoza share that on the BYETTA share. We expect some erosion, of course, from BYETTA but most of it, I think, will be remains since a lot of it, I think, is on the postprandial effect that BYETTA has. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division And when you say that demand in the wholesaler channel so far looks robust in Europe, can you give us a relative comparison about how that wholesaler demand looks relative to a comparable time point when BYETTA was launched in those same markets? Is it tracking ahead of how BYETTA was doing? Vincent P. Mihalik So Thomas, just a follow-up. I haven\'t actually gone back and made the comparison, but I would expect it to be very similar if not better. And the only reason I make that comment is, of course, uptake in Europe for wholesalers is a bit different than in the United States. The pharmacies tend to do -- order when they have a script as opposed to stocking. But I would expect that the uptake is pretty similar. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division And then just lastly, when you talked about metreleptin and the complexities that you ran into in the manufacturing runs, can you just give us a little bit more elaboration and some comfort that those issues are behind you? Dan Bradbury Yes, Thomas, I\'ll take that one. So Thomas, I mean, just to say that this is a fairly typical -- it\'s fairly typical issue that we dealt with that is often found when manufacturing large macromolecules such as metreleptin. And it was something that we encountered during the first validation run. It was -- clearly, it was a process tweak that needed to be undertaken. That process tweak was undertaken and we then subsequently have now completed the validation runs. And as you know, you have to do 3 validation runs, and the product is on stability. So we\'ve solved the technical issue and so we remain confident moving forward with regards to the submission of the CMC section for metreleptin and, I think, just to say that we remain very committed to making sure that happens, given the higher medical need in the patient population that we\'re hoping to serve. Operator Our next question will come from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Unknown Analyst -  It\'s Alethea [ph] for Robyn. But I just wanted to get a little bit more color on the market opportunity in EU, maybe particularly into emerging Europe. Do you have any plans to expand there? And what happens once you get post the big 5? Vincent P. Mihalik Yes [indiscernible] you or me in terms of the [indiscernible]. So yes, in the emerging markets, we do have plans to launch in a lot of the countries in the emerging markets and of course in Eastern Europe as well. In fact, we\'ve already launched in Romania, just as an example. So yes, that\'s part of our plans. We didn\'t disclose any of our launch dates, but we clearly have plans to do that. Unknown Analyst -  And do you think the uptick for doctors will be the same in that part of -- in the emerging countries as in the big 5 developed markets? Vincent P. Mihalik Well in volume, probably not, obviously. But I do expect that we are seeing very nice GLP-1 growth all across Europe. In fact, if you look at, I\'ll take the big 5, just the ones we keep track of more closely, we\'re seeing about a 67% growth for GLP-1s in that space. And in fact, as I speak, we\'re trending towards probably $1.5 billion to $2 billion globally for GLP-1. So it\'s a robust market, it\'s growing. You\'re seeing additional growth in adoption by physicians. And I think, since the entrance of the second GLP-1 agonist, I think doctors are really beginning to see the unique benefits of GLP-1 therapy against other classes. They\'re looking at the convenience, the better tolerability, and I think all of that bodes very well for BYDUREON. Operator Our next question will come from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Cory William Kasimov - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division I have 2 of them for you. First of all, for your BYETTA plus Lantus or glargine indication, can you discuss how this market opportunity might potentially change if and when Lantus is ultimately combined with Sanofi\'s proprietary GLP-1? And then my second question is relates to BYDUREON and post-EASD and now with BYDUREON available in Europe, are you able to comment on the impact DURATION-6 has had on physician sentiment, if it has had any impact at all? Dan Bradbury Cory, maybe I\'ll take the first question and then I\'ll ask Vince to comment with regards to D-6. So I think it\'s a little bit premature to comment about what may or may not happen with regards to lixisenatide in combination with glargine. My read on that situation has been that, that program has remained in early stage development and continues to be there. So until such time as we really know what the product is that we would be competing against, I think it\'s premature for us to comment about what may or may not be the impact of it. Perhaps, Vince, you could talk about the situation in Europe? You were at the EASD meeting, so perhaps you could comment about your impressions. Vincent P. Mihalik Yes. Thanks, Dan. So yes, being at the EASD was really a very nice experience for me because I did get to see physicians and healthcare providers react to BYDUREON at the Lilly booth. It was great to see the reactions that they had both to the efficacy and safety data as well as to the custom dosing kit. First and foremost, on the efficacy and safety, DURATION-6 is actually probably one of the lower hemoglobin A1C reductions we saw across the continuum. And when you show the doctors the full, I\'d say, composite of all of the different studies and all of the different reductions in hemoglobin A1C, you see the very positive effect it has on hemoglobin A1C and the efficacy. Doctors were very pleased with the better tolerability you see with BYDUREON versus BYETTA or Victoza. And I would also say that they were very pleased with the custom dosing kit. In fact, several -- I watched several different doctors go through the experience, and many of them said it was easy and very straightforward and their patients can do this. Even if it takes 10 minutes, they could do it for once a week. So it was a really good, positive experience. It fits with what we were trying to achieve with the -- many of those strategies that they use in Europe actually were the beginnings of work that was done here for the U.S. launch so it reinforced what we were hoping to see and the expectations we had around the full complement of studies that we have on BYDUREON with the DURATION series. Cory William Kasimov - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Okay, that\'s helpful. And Vince, just a follow-up for you, if I might. When -- using a couple of comments you made earlier with regard to expectations for more switching once BYDUREON is available in the U.S., more switching from Victoza than from BYETTA, but can you talk about your expectations for switching from patients who are on existing GLP-1s versus just new GLP-1 starts? That would -- do you expect more of the patients to come from just new starts overall that would grow the overall market? Or is it, at least initially, more switching? Vincent P. Mihalik So Cory, I am expecting more, I\'ll say, new patient starts. I think the profile that BYDUREON has is much more attractive, given that it\'s delivered once a week. It\'s a first in class, once-a-week medicine we\'ve never seen before in terms of treating diabetes. I think it\'s a real opportunity to really make a difference for patients with diabetes. And so some of the ones struggling today on orals that have in the past not been comfortable necessarily going to an injection, I think once a week\'s going to make a big difference for them. We will see some switching from GLP-1s, don\'t get me wrong, but I do believe the greatest opportunity is for new patient starts. Operator Our next question will come from Kumar Raja of Citigroup. Kumaraguru Raja I\'m stepping in for Yaron Werber. We have been seeing that the scripts have been going down for BYETTA. How can we see the sales going forward? And also for BYDUREON, how can we look in terms of expenses? Dan Bradbury Kumar, it\'s Dan. So maybe I could just take the first question with regards to prescriptions for BYETTA. Yes, they have declined. However, I don\'t think the decline is certainly to the extent that, perhaps maybe many were expecting. And as you saw from sales, you are seeing actually consistent sales quarter-on-quarter over the last 3 quarters. So I think we\'re continuing to see good sales of BYETTA, and we don\'t expect to see dramatic reductions in sales of BYETTA in the near term. With respect to your second question, with regards to BYDUREON launch cost, perhaps, Mark, you could comment with regards to our expectation there? Mark G. Foletta Sure, Dan, thanks for the question. I think we\'ve been speaking consistently about our plans for this. And really, it\'s important to understand that the operating model that we\'ve put in place really worked hard over the last few years, is really the model that was prepared to launch BYDUREON. And that\'s both our sales and marketing efforts and of course our R&D efforts. So while we do expect incremental monitoring cost to support the launch of BYDUREON, we do not anticipate significant other increases in expenses. Of course as we monitor the launch, and we will look to make investments that we believe can drive growth. We will not under-support this launch, I want to make that clear, but we do not anticipate significant changes in our operating model to enable that launch. Kumaraguru Raja If I may ask, does this take into consideration the litigation with Lilly? Mark G. Foletta I\'m sorry, could you repeat that? Kumaraguru Raja Does these plans take into consideration the litigation with Lilly? Mark G. Foletta Yes, yes. I mean, I\'ll just refer back to Dan\'s earlier comment about the business-as-usual agreement. And certainly, we believe that, between Amylin and Lilly, that we have adequate support for this launch. I\'d -- one additional comment that I\'d like to make is that I will remind you that we do earn a $40 million milestone on the approval of BYDUREON in the United States or the launch of BYDUREON in the United States and so obviously, that can support some of the incremental launch costs that we\'ve referred to. Operator Our next question will come from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Just first in terms of Germany, I wanted to understand the trends you\'re seeing. Are you seeing mostly new patient starts, or are you seeing any switching from Victoza? And then, a follow-up on pricing. Dan Bradbury Terence, I\'m going to toss that to Vince to answer that. Vincent P. Mihalik Thanks. I think it was Aaron? Dan Bradbury Terrence. Vincent P. Mihalik Terrence, sorry. Terrence, thank you for the question. Actually, we are seeing some erosion of Victoza and we are getting new patient starts, so it\'s a mixture. It\'s a very early data, though, so it\'s hard to say where that\'s actually going to end up. We\'re pleased with what we see so far and the fact that, as I commented, we\'re seeing very nice -- we\'re off to a nice weekly share of market start in Germany. And it\'s been a net growth for exenatide in terms of share of market. So overall, we\'re pleased with the start. Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division And then on the pricing front, can you give us any sense where -- how pricing has come in, in the U.K. and Germany relative to BYETTA and Victoza? And then the payments that the patients have to make out-of-pocket, particularly in Germany, are those comparable across all 3 drugs, or are there any differences there? Vincent P. Mihalik So Dan, I\'ll take this question, if it\'s okay with you. I do have the German information. Obviously, really there\'s the pricing in the U.K. and Germany. I can\'t comment on out-of-pocket cost. I don\'t know that off the top of my head, Terrence, so we\'ll have to get that for you. But in Germany, the price for BYDUREON was set pretty much at the -- at a premium, a slight premium to BYETTA but equivalent to the Victoza, I would say, the 1.2-milligram dose. Between the 1.2-milligram dose and the 1.8, the 1.2 in Germany is about the same price as BYETTA, so there\'s a slight premium to that but less than the 1.8-milligram dose. And in the U.K., it\'s a very similar pricing arrangement. Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Okay. And then if I may, just one quick question on BYDUREON in the U.S. In terms of your conversations with FDA, have they mentioned at all you guys contributing to this MTC registry that Novo has to set up for or is running currently for Victoza in terms of tracking patients over 15 years? And if you do get approval, do you expect that\'s something that you will have to do as well? Dan Bradbury Terence, it\'s Dan here. Yes, Terence, I mean I think we expect, just like anybody else developing a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist, that we would need to participate in a runs [ph] program, which would encompass tracking in the same way that Novo has to with definitely regards that issue. Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Okay, so you have talked to them about this? Dan Bradbury Yes. I mean by the way, we had -- before we had the second complete response letter, we\'d had extensive discussions with the agency. And we have, I think, consistently said we expect to be treated in a similar manner at this time. Obviously, this is all subject to final discussions with the agency and the final label and approval. Operator Our next question will come from David Friedman of Morgan Stanley. David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Just in relation to the U.S., your pricing strategy across your products and your formulary status. Given that you\'ve taken a couple larger price increases for BYETTA than historically and your price delta is getting closer to Victoza and given that you\'ve consistently wanted to maintain a good Tier 2 formulary status, how do you view sort of your price increase strategy and how you\'re thinking of BYETTA with regards to how you\'re going to try to maintain good Tier 2 formulary access? Or is one of those variables going to take a backseat? Dan Bradbury Well, let -- maybe I should comment on that, David. So let me just say that fundamentally, we believe that it\'s really important to maximize access to as many patients as possible for our products, and we continue to be committed to that. I think there is -- perhaps one thing I would like to say is that what your comment there with regards to the delta with Victoza, I think that\'s actually been maintained pretty consistent as a result of also price increases that have occurred to Victoza as well. Going forward, at this point, we\'re not in a position to guide with regards to our pricing strategy to BYDUREON, but I would reiterate comments that I\'ve made previously that we are committed to ensuring that BYDUREON is available and there is good access to patients with -- at a low tier for BYDUREON going forward. David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division And then just a quick follow-up, if I could. Has there been any change in the formulary status of BYETTA with the recent price changes? Or has that been stable? Dan Bradbury It\'s been very stable. Operator Our next question will come from Richard Resnick [ph] of William Blair. Unknown Analyst -  This is Rich Resnick [ph] for John Sonnier. Regarding the pipeline, I have 2 questions. The first is for the EXSCEL trial. I know it doesn\'t read out for a couple of years, but is there any interim date that you guys might have? And if so, could you say what would be and when it might read out? And then the second question is about AC165198. I just wanted to see if the IND and Phase I is still on track for year end and if you had anything more than you wanted to say about that? Dan Bradbury Yes, sure, thanks for both those questions. Certainly with regards to EXSCEL, at this time there are no plans to do an interim analysis. That\'s always an option for at some point in the future. But at this time, there are no plans to do an interim analysis of that. With regards to AC165198, yes, it remains on track to file an IND by the end of this year. Operator Our next question will come from Ian Somaiya of Piper Jaffray. M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Sorry, one quick follow-up for you. Have you been able to track the patients who are getting BYDUREON in Europe? Just some sense that do they have any prior experience with BYETTA? I think you mentioned there\'s some cannibalization of Victoza, so I\'m just curious whether these patients ever tried BYETTA. Dan Bradbury Ian, yes, it\'s a good question. I don\'t believe we have that kind of granularity of nature at this time and so it\'s too early for us to comment on that. Operator We have no further questions at this time. Dan Bradbury Okay. Well thanks, everybody. Thanks for your interest and for your questions. I appreciate them. Here at Amylin, we know we have a huge opportunity to continue to advance our mission of discovering, developing and commercializing medicines to improve the lives of patients. And our leadership team and the many dedicated employees of Amylin remain focused on building the business today and laying the necessary foundation for our success in the future. If you have any additional questions regarding the call today or any other aspect of our business, please call Michael or Jeff on our -- at our IR team.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Michael York, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Michael York Good afternoon, and welcome to Amylin Pharmaceuticals\' quarterly update conference call. We\'ve uploaded a presentation to accompany this conference call that provides additional background on the quarter. Today\'s discussion will contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are outlined in today\'s press release, the website presentation and in our recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our actual results could differ materially from what is discussed on today\'s call. Let me introduce the other members of the Amylin management Amylin management team here today: Daniel Bradbury, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Foletta, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Dan Bradbury. Dan Bradbury Thanks, Michael, and welcome to our fourth quarter and year-end call for 2011. This afternoon, our comments will build on the press release issued earlier today. In a few moments, Mark will provide additional details on our financial results for 2011 and comment on our outlook for 2012. Our recent announcement regarding the approval of BYDUREON in the United States was the culmination of diligent effort and successful execution. We achieved numerous goals and milestones during 2011 which I\'ll briefly review before commenting on our focus for 2012. We achieved successes with both of our marketed products, BYETTA and SYMLIN. Regarding BYETTA, we stabilized revenue and expanded the label such that to date, it has the broadest label of any GLP-1 receptor agonist. We grew SYMLIN revenue as we discontinued the SYMLIN vial and converted patients to the SYMLIN pen. In addition to the successes we achieved with our marketed products and perhaps most importantly for 2011, we successfully advanced BYDUREON by rapidly responding to the requests outlined in the second complete response letter we received from FDA. Outside the United States, BYDUREON was approved in the European Union and received a favorable recommendation from NICE in the United Kingdom, further supporting the value proposition of this revolutionary medicine. Looking to ensure long-term shareholder value, we also advanced our metabolic pipeline. We obtained positive results from our proof-of-concept study for exenatide once-monthly suspension program and held a successful end-of-Phase-II meeting with the FDA. We also advanced our program for rare forms of lipodystrophy with a hormone analog, metreleptin. From a financial perspective, 2011 was also a successful year. We continued to focus on managing expenses in line with revenues, and ended the year with non-GAAP operating income of $25.7 million. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we grew revenues for both of our marketed products with BYETTA growing by 3.5% to $132.6 million; and SYMLIN growing by 1.3% to $28.3 million. Our execution of the settlement deal to acquire the global rights to the exenatide franchise rounded out an eventful year for us, and we\'re now in the best position we\'ve ever been in to successfully launch BYDUREON, the first weekly-dose diabetes therapy in the United States. 2011 truly set the stage for 2012. This year, we have an exceptional opportunity as a company. Following the U.S. approval of BYDUREON on the 27th of January, it is now approved in 31 countries. And with our pending launch in the U.S., we\'ll soon be launched in 11. We\'re on the verge of taking a truly remarkable step forward in advancing the treatment of type 2 diabetes and plan on having the product available to patients in the United States on February 17, just 3 weeks following approval. Our plan to segment our commercial organization into 2 discrete units, 1 focused on exenatide and the other on specialty and orphan products has been implemented now that BYDUREON has been approved. We have completed the hiring of the 325 additional diabetes sales specialists for the exenatide commercial unit. And within the week, we expect to complete the hiring of 65 additional diabetes sales specialists into our specialty and orphan commercial unit. The training of these new specialists has already commenced and we plan to have these new resources fully deployed by the 1st of March. Our existing sales force of 325 diabetes sales specialists is already trained and priming the market for the availability of BYDUREON on the 17th of this month. With prescriptions for GLP-1 receptor agonists having grown by nearly 50% since February of 2010, and the class now approaching $2 billion in global sales, we believe that awareness of the benefits of GLP-1 therapy is at an all-time high, and the timing of the pending BYDUREON launch could not be better. It is our goal to continue to grow the GLP-1 receptor agonist class with both the launch of BYDUREON and the new BYETTA indication, which is for use in people who have not achieved adequate glucose control with insulin glargine alone. With BYDUREON, we have the unique opportunity to grow and shape the long-acting GLP-1 market. And with BYETTA, the only GLP-1 receptor agonist indicated for use in combination with the world\'s best-selling basal insulin, we have the opportunity to establish a new market for short acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. As we have reacquired the global rights to exenatide molecule, this opportunity extends beyond the United States. Our efforts to secure a new partner for countries outside the United States are ongoing with substantial interest from numerous large pharma companies with extensive global presence. As we look to the future, we\'re also advancing several important lifecycle initiatives for both BYDUREON and the exenatide molecule. Development of the BYDUREON pen continues to remain on track and we expect to have this presentation available to patients in the United States in the fourth quarter of this year or in the first quarter of next year, depending on the length of the regulatory review. The Phase III program for the weekly suspension formulation of exenatide will commence in the middle of this year and the Phase III initiation for the monthly suspension formulation is targeted for 2013. We are continuing to add centers and enroll patients for our ongoing EXSCEL cardiovascular outcome study, which is investigating the potential for BYDUREON to reduce cardiovascular events relative to the standard of care in patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition to the advances we are pursuing for our exenatide franchise, we\'re making excellent progress on 2 other development programs. Our metreleptin program in rare forms of lipodystrophy continues to advance, with completion of the rolling BLA submission on track for the end of the first half of this year. Regarding AC165198, our peptide hybrid molecule, or phybrid, which we are developing with our program Biocon, we began enrolling patients in a Phase I study last month. While we invest in the launch of BYDUREON and other strategic priorities, we will continue to manage our expenses in line with our revenues. As Mark will highlight momentarily, our strong fourth quarter and year-end financial results reflect the significant efforts we have made to drive efficiencies across our business. I\'ll now turn things over to Mark to review our financial results released earlier today. Mark G. Foletta Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon. Today, we announced our financial results for the fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 2011. As Dan mentioned, we continue to manage the business with operational discipline and are focused on minimizing expenses while maintaining a strong cash position and fully supporting the launch of BYDUREON. And as we have discussed previously, we believe the key metric to track our financial progress is non-GAAP operating results which approximates our cash flow from operations before working capital changes. Our non-GAAP operating results are defined as our GAAP operating results, excluding restructuring charges and non-cash items comprised of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and the amortization of acquired intangible assets and fair value adjustments. This definition of our non-GAAP operating results has changed slightly from definition we\'ve used historically. The changes have been implemented to account for several items related to the deal we executed to reacquire global rights to the exenatide franchise. I\'ll be describing these and other facets of the accounting treatment of the transaction in greater detail after reviewing our financial results. Non-GAAP operating income in 2011 was $25.7 million compared to a loss of $4.4 million in 2010. Total revenues decreased 2.7% to $650.7 million in 2011 from $668.8 million in 2010. Our gross margins improved to 92% from 91% in 2011. Our operating expenses were $432.4 million in 2011, consisting of $271.2 million of selling, general and administrative expenses and $161.2 million of research and development expenses. This represents a 6% decrease from our operating expenses in 2010. As I will discuss in a moment, we expect our operating expenses to increase in 2012 now that we have full operational control of exenatide. We ended 2011 with $214.6 million in cash and investments and are well-positioned to execute our plans in 2012. I\'d like to make a few additional comments regarding the fourth quarter versus the third quarter results. We reported non-GAAP operating income of $17.6 million for the fourth quarter compared to non-GAAP operating income of $13 million in the third quarter. The improvements in our quarter-over-quarter non-GAAP operating results reflect decreased research and development expenses and decreased collaborative profit sharing, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expense. This improvement largely reflects the impact of the new economics for exenatide and the favorable disposition of certain cost-sharing disputes with Eli Lilly and Company. Before I move into a more detailed discussion of the accounting for the exenatide rights agreement, I\'d like to comment on our sequential quarterly revenue and operating expense results. BYETTA sales increased $4.5 million sequentially or 3.5%. The increase was driven by a fourth quarter price action, partially offset by a 3.1% decline in prescription volume during this period. Wholesaler inventories at December 31 were comparable to those at September 30, and we believe are consistent with patient demand. SYMLIN sales increased $1.3 million sequentially, driven primarily by pricing actions taken earlier in the year and flat prescription volume. For further details regarding our financial results from the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, please refer to the presentation available on our company website. Having discussed recurring operations, I\'ll now take a few moments to describe the accounting for the reacquisition of global exenatide economic interest from Lilly in the fourth quarter of 2011. Again, please refer to the slides in the accompanying presentation on our website as a supplement to this discussion. We agreed to make the following payments to Lilly as consideration in the transactions. One, a $250 million upfront cash payment funded in November 2011. Two, a revenue-sharing obligation, or RSO, of 15% of global net sales of exenatide products providing up to $1.2 billion in value to Lilly, plus interest. The RSO accrues interest at a 9.5% annual rate with the interest being added to the note balance quarterly. And three, we also agreed to reimburse Lilly for up to $60 million of operating losses incurred outside of the United States prior to the transition to Amylin. An additional $150 million milestone payment is contingent upon the U.S. regulatory approval of a once-monthly formulation of exenatide. For accounting purposes, the net consideration to acquire Lilly\'s global economic interest in exenatide was valued at $1.1 billion, and was allocated as follows. $736 million, or approximately 70% of the total, was allocated to U.S. economic interests. This amount is further allocated $275 million to BYETTA and $461 million to BYDUREON and exenatide suspension. The amount allocated to BYETTA was recorded as an intangible assets and will be amortized to our income statement as a non-cash expense over time. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded $4 million of amortization expense. The amount allocated to BYDUREON and exenatide suspension is included in the $432 million onetime expense reported in the fourth quarter of 2011 and is net of an accounting gain associated with foregone BYDUREON launch milestones. $328 million, approximately 30% of the consideration, was associated with the acquisition of the OUS business. In accordance with business combination accounting rules, this asset will be treated as a prepaid acquisition cost until OUS operations are transitioned from Lilly. The RSO was valued at $977 million for accounting purposes as the 9.5% interest rate was deemed below market value. This obligation was recorded as debt on our balance sheet. The effective interest rate on the RSO is 14.4%. We recorded $11 million of interest expense associated with the RSO in the fourth quarter. Lastly, the potential $150 million milestone payment payable on the U.S. approval of a monthly formulation of exenatide will be accounted for at a later date if the milestone is achieved. Having described the accounting treatment of the major complements of the exenatide rights transaction, I\'d like now to highlight some information regarding key trends and assumptions for 2012. In early 2011, we indicated that our quarterly GAAP operating expenses would be $110 million to $115 million. For the full year of 2011, we operated at the low end of this range as a result of our focus on operating efficiencies. In November 2011, following the reacquisition of exenatide, we indicated that we would be assuming incremental annual cash operating expenses of $150 million to $170 million in 2012 to fully support exenatide commercial and R&D activities. The improved exenatide gross profit economics we gained through the transaction will fund the majority of these incremental cash expenses. Consequently, we expect our operating expenses in 2012 consisting of selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses to be between $600 million and $625 million. As has been the case over the past 3 years, our non-GAAP operating results will be the key metric we use to measure our performance in 2012. Historically, our non-GAAP operating results were defined as our GAAP operating results, excluding the restructuring charges and non-cash items, comprised of stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization. As I mentioned previously, following the reacquisition of exenatide, we are making the following changes to the definition of our non-GAAP operating results. We will exclude acquisition-related charges in the amortization of acquired intangibles and we will include the 15% RSO payment on exenatide global sales. In 2012, we are expecting a non-GAAP operating loss of between $20 million and $40 million. I will now provide some further quantitative and qualitative guidance to assist you in understanding our expectations for 2012. Collaborative revenues, consisting of the amortization of the upfront payment we received from Takeda as part of our 2010 obesity collaboration, will be $7.5 million. We expect royalties on exenatide gross margin outside of the United States to be less than $5 million. We expect combined gross margins for BYETTA, BYDUREON and SYMLIN of approximately 80%. We expect net interest expense to be $165 million to $175 million, approximately $140 million of interest expense associated with the RSO. As I discussed earlier, the RSO has an accounting value of $977 million and an effective interest rate of 14.4% per year. Non-cash adjustments, including depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, are expected to be between $105 million and $115 million. The increase from approximately $84 million in 2011 primarily reflects increased depreciation expense for our Ohio manufacturing facility. As we described earlier in the call, an tangible asset, which represents the allocated accounting value of U.S. BYETTA economic interest, will be amortized to the income statement over time and excluded from our non-GAAP operating results. We expected this amount to be approximately $30 million in 2012. With respect to our cash flows, we offer the following additional comments. We intend to continue to focus on tightly managing our cash in 2012 while investing in the working capital to support the launch of BYDUREON. Additionally, our first 2012 RSO payment will not be made until the fourth quarter. We do not expect our capital expenditures to change significantly from $26.8 million in 2011. To summarize, we are pleased with our solid financial performance in 2011 which reflects our focused discipline to manage expenses, closely in line with expected revenues. This discipline will continue in 2012 while we fully invest to support the BYDUREON launch in the United States. Now I will turn the call back over to Dan for a few additional comments. Dan Bradbury Thanks, Mark. Before the close of our prepared remarks, I\'ll just add a few more comments. I would again like to take a moment to acknowledge and thank the employees at Amylin whose hard work and the diligent efforts enabled several key achievements in 2011 that led to the eventual approval of BYDUREON. Having just returned from an extraordinarily enthusiastic launch meeting for BYDUREON last week, I can say that the Amylin team is ready to launch BYDUREON, and is truly looking forward to bringing this revolutionary medicine to physicians and patients across the country. Additionally, I\'d like to note that this will be the last earnings call for Michael York who has moved on to accept a new role here at Amylin as the Vice President in charge of our specialty and orphan commercial unit. Michael brings over 20 years of commercial strategy leadership and operations experience in both biotech and pharma. The role of Senior Director of Investor Relations and the new point of contact for the investment community will be held by Christine Everett-Zedelmayer. Please join me in welcoming Christine to this new role. In closing, I\'d like to reiterate that I, along with the Amylin leadership team, remain committed to creating value for our shareholders, our employees, and most importantly, the millions of diabetes patients we\'re focused on serving. I\'ll now ask the operator to open the lines for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Jim Birchenough of BMO Capital. Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S. Congratulations to Michael, and I\'ve got a couple of questions. Just first on the accounting for the RSO and that 15% of exenatide sales. Can you confirm again how that 15% is hitting the P&L, if at all? It was hard to follow all the numbers there, but I just want to confirm that you\'re offloading the partnership expense. And I want to know where you\'re accounting for the 15% RSO as a cash payment to Lilly. And then just a second question, as you think about the BYDUREON launch, could you maybe talk to what proportion of patients you think might be warehoused right now? We\'ve seen some launches where we\'ve had the initial bolus. Maybe if you could comment on that dynamic, if you think it\'s going to play out or if it\'s going to be a slow build. Dan Bradbury Hi, Jim. Firstly, thanks for congratulating Michael. We\'re excited about him taking on that new role. I\'ll pass your RSO question over to Mark in a second. Maybe just to answer your second question about potential patients being warehoused for the BYDUREON launch, we actually don\'t have a specific number that I can give you there, but what I can tell you is that without doubt and in my experience and I think in Vince\'s experience, we\'ve never actually been involved in a launch where awareness of a new product was as high as it was for BYDUREON. Now clearly, that\'s a consequence of a number of factors. The products\' features and benefits, of course, are key to that but also, of course, the time that it has been -- it was in the regulatory review also contributed to that. So I think you\'re right, there are patients who are waiting to come on BYDUREON. I just can\'t give you a number at this point. Mark, perhaps you could comment on the RSO? Mark G. Foletta Sure, Jim. We did record the revenue sharing obligation for GAAP purposes to our balance sheet as debt. However -- and we will be amortizing that at 15% of exenatide sales. We did say, on our non-GAAP guidance, though, that we will include that 15% RSO payment against our non-GAAP results. That was contemplated in the guidance that we gave of $20 million to $40 million non-GAAP loss -- operating loss in 2012. Operator Next question is from Tom Russo of Baird. Thomas J. Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Your competitor earnings call recently provided a macro outlook for the segment about doubling to a 10% share by dollars and contemplating kind of their market share expectations. Just wondering if you would be willing to provide your outlook for the segment growth and any market share expectations that you have from your end, long-term expectations. Dan Bradbury Yes, hi, Tom, thanks for the question. We have not given and do not intend to give specific guidance with regards to our expectation. I think that what we can say, however, is consistent with that competitive comment is that we do expect to see the GLP-1 market grow substantially. And certainly, I thought it was interesting to comment with regards to market share because when one does the math, that would be a very substantial position for Amylin relative to our current position in the market globally. So -- but that all having been said, at this point, I think we can see the market now is already over $2 billion and growing at a very substantial rate. Thomas J. Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Okay. And then last but real quick, what\'s left to complete between now and filing the pen early enough such that it could be potentially be improved -- approved by the fourth quarter? What\'s left between now and filing? Dan Bradbury Just a few things, really. We\'re completing some stability work. We have to have a certain amount of stability work completed, and then, of course, there\'s the compilation of the application itself. Those are the 2 kind of major factors. And we don\'t see any challenges with completing those in time to have the pen available by the end of this year or early next year. Operator The quest the next question is from Ian Somaiya of Piper Jaffray. M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division I was hoping to touch base or have you revisit the idea of awareness. Can you give us some qualitative feedback you\'re getting from physicians or at or even on the patient side regarding BYDUREON? And I just have a question for Mark on the financials. Dan Bradbury Sure, hi, Ian. Well, I think from a qualitative point of view, certainly, I think maybe I can maybe talk to some of the comments from some of our salespeople last week at the launch meeting. I mean, they spontaneously receive phone calls from physicians asking when they would be able to prescribe, when the products would be available. The interesting thing as well is when we\'ve done market research, our physicians actually call out the BYDUREON brand by name. So it\'s not just talking to a generic name or some theoretical product. They\'re already aware of the brand, and that\'s been very consistent over the last 6 to 9 months. So we\'re feeling very pleased about that and that certainly does give us a very strong situation. From a patient perspective, I mean, certainly, I guess anecdotally, I\'ve had number of patients asking me directly. We\'ve seen postings on blogs across social media networks as well as across the infamous investor blogs as well, with regarding when they would be available. And I think as I said earlier, you\'ve also had patients who have gone into physicians which have then resulted in calls to us saying when can physicians ask for the product and when will it be available. And as I said on the -- in my prepared remarks, we believe, product -- we believe, we know, product will be available in pharmacies by the 17th of February. M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Okay. And what type of -- what level of inventory do you anticipate being held by your [indiscernible] Mark G. Foletta Ian, could you be more specific, what do you mean being held? M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Well, I mean, just given the launch, given the awareness, I mean, what type of inventory should we assume? Mark G. Foletta Yes, so we have been making inventory, as you know, certainly for the OUS market. And be -- and have certainly begun to put inventory together for the U.S. market. As Dan said, we expect it in the market by the end of next week. We have said that typically, you have a bolus of product that gets launched. And yes, it\'s usually around somewhere around 4 weeks that -- at the outset. So we would expect to see the shipments of that relatively soon here, and then, future orders will come based upon demand. Given the timing of this, we\'ll certainly provide more -- further outlook on this when we get to our Q1 call in April, because we\'ll have a good sense of what the channel is looking like then. M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division And I guess, the question was more related to also how much inventory do you have on hand to supply the market? Dan Bradbury Well, maybe -- I mean, we have plenty of inventory available to put 4 weeks worth of product into distributors, which is what we would aim to do before the -- in the next week or so. Mark G. Foletta Yes, so we were building inventory in the fourth quarter. And I may remind you that we actually had some inventory that was available actually 1 year ago that can be used in the marketplace, a little over 1 year ago, following our second complete response, so -- which isn\'t actually even on the books. So anyway, we have plenty of inventory to support the market. Operator The next question is from Mark Schoenebaum with ISI. Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Hey, Mark, we\'re going to miss you on calls. There\'ll be nobody to confuse all the biotech analysts with accounting jargon. Michael York No, you\'re still going to have me. Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Hey, I was -- number one -- I just had like -- I had 4 questions, but they\'re really short. Number one, why the decision to not get any explicit sales guidance? And number two, this is always dangerous because I\'m really bad at math, but when I take your guidance and try to back out what you guys imply for revenue for the company, I get to something like $660 million to $680 million, which is like low single-digit growth for total company revenue over 2011. So wondering if my math is right and why such low growth? Do you expect a lot of cannibalization at first? And then any help on the CapEx line for this year? And then finally, one for Dan. The pen that\'s you\'re -- that\'s going to be approved in the next, call it, 12 months, how exactly is that different from the weekly suspension? Like what exactly is this pen? Can you literally describe it for us to help us understand what kind of impact it would have in the marketplace versus the weekly suspension? Dan Bradbury Yes, sure. So just to give Mark some time to do some back-of-the-envelope calculations there, Mark, to come up with your numbers, I\'ll answer the last question first. So with the pen is actually going to be one which is made up of a single jeweled chamber cartridge. In those, the 2 chambers of the cartridge, 1 chamber will have the microspheres and then the other chamber will have the diluent. When a patient uses the pen, it will be a simple case of essentially actuating the cartridge so that the diluent goes into the microsphere chamber. The patient then would then suspend the microspheres by shaking the pen and then they\'d be able to inject. So it\'s all in a single device. Now the big difference with the suspension is that the suspension already has microspheres suspended in a different diluent, which is possible to do because of the uniqueness of that formulation. So it actually takes out of the step the reconstitution of the microspheres. Okay, is that clear? Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division That\'s great. That helps a lot. Dan Bradbury Okay. Now, Mark, over to you for the questions... Mark G. Foletta I\'ll take -- first, I\'ll take the lack... Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division My goal is to stump you as a going-away present, so proceed. Mark G. Foletta I\'m not going anywhere. Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Just kidding. Mark G. Foletta That\'s Michael York. You still get to deal with me Mark. So anyway, with respect to the CapEx, that\'s the easy one. We did have in our prepared remarks, we expect CapEx to be comparable to 2011, and that\'s a number, $26 million approximately, that we had in 2011, and my -- primarily focused around our facility in Ohio. With respect to your back calculation of revenue, I think there is a few things that are at play here. One is obviously, the mix of revenue. We did guide margins, blended margins of 80%, but depending upon the mix of the revenue across our products, BYDUREON, BYETTA and SYMLIN, the revenue number that we have for each product, is -- we have range of forecast for each of those products. And with respect to your back calculation, I don\'t think you\'re thinking about it inaccurately. We certainly would expect early on to have some switching of BYETTA patients to, and potentially Victoza patients to -- into BYDUREON. And as we look to grow the market in -- earlier in the continuum of care, and then we will be promoting BYETTA in the -- with our new indication on top of basal, as we said in the prepared remarks. But we don\'t want to provide specific guidance and I think it really comes down to the mix of the products. But we\'re very bullish on the opportunity, as Dan said earlier, of this market growing and us continuing to secure revenue growth as we move through the year. Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Okay. Sorry I confused you with Michael. Sorry, Michael. Mark G. Foletta No problem. It\'s okay. Operator The next question is from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division So I guess -- so quick question, I guess, accounting questions. So are you re-recording the interest payment associated with the RSO and when do you expect to make those payments? And then second question I had, for the sales force that you\'re bring on from Lilly, are you now going to have permanent contracts for those sales individuals or are they still temporary sales contracts? Dan Bradbury So maybe I\'ll take the second question first. I mean, just to clarify, first and foremost, we\'re not taking on any sales people from Lilly. We actually have hired our own contract sales organization. We have the contracts that will, each person will have in place is a 2-year contract, it will be -- but with a 1-year renewal. So it\'s actually a pretty long-term contract that we\'ll have in place. Although, of course, we always have the opportunity to adjust that if we need to at any time, but there will always are consequences associated with canceling a contract or changing a contract outside of the cycle. Perhaps that you\'re asking the -- your first question regarding interest, Mark, do you want to comment on that? Mark G. Foletta Yes, Robyn, it\'s Mark here. We will be recording interest expense through our income statement on the RSO and the way you should think about it that is it\'ll be -- below the line will be interest cost. We guided that, it was $140 million in 2012 of approximately $160 million to -- $160 million of the total interest expense. So the majority of interest expense we\'d expect this year will be associated with the RSO. And then of course, payments on the RSO, you asked when we would make them. The way the agreement was struck is the first RSO payment for 2012 will not be made until the fourth quarter, the 1-year anniversary of the deal. But we\'ll be accruing that to quarter -- throughout the year, but the first payment will not be made until the fourth quarter. And then we will be making them quarterly thereafter, starting in 2013. And I think I said this, but the interest does get added to the principal, so you\'ll see the RSO obligation that\'s on the books at the end of the year at $977 million grow throughout the year. Operator Next question is from Cory Kasimov of JPMC. Cory William Kasimov - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division I realized it\'s only been 1 week, but can you describe the initial reaction from payers regarding the price of BYDUREON? Dan Bradbury So with the caveat, yes, it has only been 1 week. I would just say that I think we\'ve had positive reactions so far. We\'ve had a number of calls from payers keen to meet with our managed care organization team. And I would say, Cory, that the pricing strategy that we are adopting -- we\'ve adopted for BYDUREON, I think, has been well received to-date. But I would then say -- I go back, say, it is early. And certainly, we\'re at the stage now where people are wanting proposals and they also want the dossier, of course, that we prepared to enable them to get to review as soon as possible. Cory William Kasimov - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Okay. And then for Mark, on OpEx, can you talk a little bit about the dynamics behind the drop in R&D from the third quarter to fourth quarter of 2011? And then, if the relative breakdown between R&D and SG&A is going to be similar in 2012 as it was in Q4. Mark G. Foletta Yes. So let me first take the first question first, Cory. With respect to the drop of R&D costs in the fourth quarter, that was somewhat related to, we mentioned in the prepared remarks, settlement of some ongoing cost-sharing disputes with Lilly that we resolved during the quarter. So I wouldn\'t look at that as a sustainable level. And obviously, we\'re -- we\'ve guided that we\'ll be adding expenses as a result of the full support of activities on the R&D side and the commercial side in 2012. So please refer to that guidance of $600 million to $625 million of GAAP expenses. With respect to the proportion of those expenses being SG&A versus R&D, I think the way to think about that is it would be comparable to the proportion that we had in 2011 with the caveat that it is a launch year, so they might be slightly weighted towards the sales and marketing side. Cory William Kasimov - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Okay. And then lastly, you\'re responsible for up to, I believe, $60 million in the European operating loss. Are you able to quantify for us in any way kind of where that stands right now in terms of the profitability or lack thereof of the European operations for Lilly? Dan Bradbury So Cory, you\'re absolutely right. We are responsible up to a maximum of $60 million over 2 years to the end of 2013. Obviously, if-- there are multiple factors that affect that. So once we are able to establish a new OUS partnership, that would change the dynamic with respect to the exposure to that. I think the other thing there is as well, we are working very closely with Lilly to control those expenses and agree on what those expenses associated with the launches of BYDUREON outside the United States, and the ongoing expenses associated with the promotion of BYDUREON and BYETTA outside of the United States are. So I would say that, that is a maximum number and we do not have full expectation that, that will be what we will finally book. That having been said, at this point, given the variables that are affecting it, it\'s not possible to guide to a precise number. Mark G. Foletta Cory, the only thing I\'ll add there is that we did mention in the prepared remarks that in the context of our accounting for this transaction, that we actually estimated, we were conservative and actually built that into the accounting so it\'s -- of approximately $45 million really using kind of a present value and a probable concept, if you will. And so you will not see material amounts flowing to our P&L on this. And to the extent this gets revalued, it actually will be done kind of outside of the operations of the company going forward. Operator Next question is from Thomas Wei of Jefferies. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division I wanted to ask a couple of questions. The first just on the guidance and some of the math that we\'re all trying to do on the fly here. Actually, I got 2 slightly different numbers than Mark did. And basically, it looks to me like you would need combined BYETTA, BYDUREON sales to grow roughly 15% to 20%-ish. So maybe something like $600 million in combined franchise sales, is that the right way of thinking about things? And given the fact that, that seems much higher than maybe what street expectations were for and certainly relative to the current rate of BYETTA prescription decline, I guess, I\'m interested to understand a little bit better what the thought process was behind that. Dan Bradbury So Thomas, maybe I can comment on that. Well, I just reiterate that we don\'t provide specific revenue guidance. And obviously, you guys have to do your own work with respect to what your expectations with regards to revenue. However, I would reiterate that we continue to have high level of confidence in the launch of BYDUREON. We do expect that it will grow share of the GLP-1 market. And we also expect that BYETTA will -- although we expect there will be some cannibalization with BYDUREON and BYETTA, we do expect that BYETTA will establish its own market, the short-acting GLP-1 market, which will contribute to our 2012 results. So I think that you\'ve done some pretty elegant math there, and it\'s up to yourself, really, to finalize what you think what your numbers will be. But I would say that we do continue to be confident in the launch of BYDUREON. I\'ll let Mark... Mark G. Foletta Yes, the only thing I\'ll add is I suspect the differences that you guys are calculating possibly is in how you\'re -- the level of sales you\'re assuming, and we have said the 15% of exenatide sales will be -- flow through our non-GAAP results, that\'s the RSO payment. And so maybe, that\'s a factor that\'s in the mix as well. And of course, we also have SYMLIN, which did slightly over $100 million in 2012 -- or \'11, I\'m sorry. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division I think I\'ve accounted for the 15% correctly. But maybe just on the kind of on the bigger picture here, is part of -- when you set out to give us this guidance, you obviously have your own expectations built in, otherwise you couldn\'t have given us non-GAAP operating loss guidance. Did you base that on how -- do you only have one market worth of data for BYDUREON launch, that would be in Germany. Is that kind of what you used as the proxy for uptick or do you model BYETTA, BYDUREON dynamics in the U.S. very differently from the way that it\'s gone in Germany so far? Dan Bradbury So we certainly haven\'t used Germany as the proxy for the United States. We built our own model for the United States. I think you have to look at those markets and remember that they\'re very different in terms of patient access from day 1. In Germany, once a product is approved, that product is freely available. I shouldn\'t say, freely available, but is available widely across the entire healthcare system to all physicians to prescribe. That is not the case here in the United States, as you know. And there is a period of time where there\'s a lag in availability of the product directly to patients through their various different -- depending on the structure of their healthcare plans. So we built our own model, which is very -- I can tell you, very complicated and sophisticated based on individual plan access and the timing of individual plan access, as well as modeling other product launches recently and how those products have been taken up. So it\'s a little bit more complicated than that, Thomas, I guess, is probably the bottom line. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division And maybe if I\'m... Mark G. Foletta Tom, I have one more comment to maybe help. We did give a range of $25 million for GAAP operating expenses as well. So probably the way to think about where we\'ll be in that range is somewhat how we\'ll be at the top line. So you probably would think they would be higher in that range than the expense range if we were at the higher range of our forecast and vice versa. And we did also guide the non-GAAP number to pull out of the GAAP operating expenses. And that\'s going up to $105 million to $115 million. So I know there\'s a lot of math that you\'re having to do and you haven\'t had a lot of time to do it, but those are additional factors to consider. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division That\'s helpful. And then maybe, Dan, maybe just to follow-up on what you just -- we\'re talking about, does that -- the way that you described it, it sounds like you have modeled for less aggressive BYDUREON uptake in the U.S. than maybe what we\'ve seen so far in Germany. That would be my takeaway from what you\'ve said. Is that fair? Dan Bradbury Well, I think, yes. I think that\'s true. Because in Germany, you can expect to see access very quickly. That having been said, of course, one, you have to take into account, Tom, I mean, the U.S. market, significantly greater than the German market in terms of size. And so even for -- even in the United States, the size of the early access group, if you like, is extremely large. And so we don\'t see access per se being a major challenge early on. It\'s something that we would -- because many plans, by the way, have a period of time where they make -- enable product to be available until they\'ve established their rules. That having been said, there are plans where that\'s not the case. So you can\'t just do a straight proportional sort of, "This is what it\'s like in Germany and this is what\'s it\'s going to be like in the United States." It\'s a bit more complicated. Operator Next question is from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division I just wanted to confirm that until you establish a new marketing partner, ex-U.S., that the revenues that you\'ll recognize in the foreseeable future here are the legacy royalty rate that you had with the Lilly for sales of BYETTA and BYDUREON. Is that correct? Dan Bradbury Yes, Steve. Yes, that is correct. Mark G. Foletta Yes, that\'s correct, Steve, and we guided that as -- in the absence of the transition to a new partner in 2012, we guided that at less than $5 million. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Okay. And Mark, I recall that one time, you talked about the Ohio plant. This is, well, pre-approval. But in the -- and it has fixed cost that were somewhere in the $100 million a year range, is that correct? And how are you -- how has the accounting on that changed post-approval and the termination of the Lilly agreement? Mark G. Foletta Well, that is correct, that we have fixed cost of approximately $100 million. We did say that approximately half of those were non-cash depreciation. In the fourth quarter, we did begin to capitalize some of those costs to the extent that they previously were going to flow into our P&L and we\'re sharing them with Lilly. And then as we got -- as we began to make some inventory towards the end of the year, we\'ve began to capitalize some of those. And clearly and as we move into 2012, we will be recording those costs on the balance sheet, understanding that, that will then impact the BYDUREON cost of goods sold because those -- some of those could -- we have a capacity, obviously, to build a lot of units. And as the manufacturing ramps up, the cost per unit will be higher, so we\'ll have some cogs impact, the higher that we\'ve talked about earlier, higher cogs, lower gross margins. But there\'s really -- I guess, to summarize the changes, it is now going into inventory. It\'s no longer, obviously, being shared with Lilly. But a significant amount of that -- of those fixed costs are non-cash depreciation. So our cash margins will be higher than what we\'ve guided. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division And that roughly 80% gross margin that you talked about, that was kind of an all-in with all the products, does that include these fixed costs for the Ohio plant? Mark G. Foletta Yes, it does. So it\'s a blended margin for the products and it does include an element of non-cash depreciation. So that\'s why I said that our cash margins will be higher. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division And was some of the R&D stepdown due to a shift out of those depreciation expenses after the approval? Mark G. Foletta No. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division It was in R&D and moving forward, it would move out of there? Mark G. Foletta Yes. So that is -- to an earlier question about R&D I mean, that is one reason why R&D will decline, because we\'ll no longer be recording those costs through R&D. I had mentioned in a response to an earlier question that the biggest reason for the decline sequentially was to resolution of a cost-sharing dispute. But a smaller reason was the fact was that some of those costs that used to flow through R&D are now flowing into the balance sheet. You should think about that as you think about R&D levels in 2012. Operator The next question is from Yaron Werber from Citigroup. Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Congrats for approval, and Michael, congrats on moving on. I can see your smile all the way from here that you\'re not going to deal with us anymore. Dan Bradbury He\'s going to miss you. Don\'t worry. Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Michael, give me your number, I\'ll call you. So just -- I have a quick question on -- actually, 2 quick questions. So one, just to follow on Steve\'s question, has to do with -- just so we understand, did you have a chance to pre-expense inventory in the past? And so essentially, the 80% gross margin, is that going to be essentially, including some pre-expense inventory which you\'re not going to be essentially paying for now, and so should we think of it as a good steady-state into next year? Or I\'m just trying to sense how much of that has been pre-expense? And then, I have a follow-up, too. Dan Bradbury I\'ll say, Mark, over to you. Mark G. Foletta Okay. Yaron, we did say, in fact, it was-- respond to an earlier question that there is some inventory that was pre-expense associated with the second complete response letter in late 2010. And that will work its way into our supply chain, into our product. But that\'s contemplated in the 80% margins that we guided. Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division So does that mean that as we think of next year, we should assume that some of that pre-expensed inventory is not going to be there anymore, and so we should think of -- is that going up? Essentially, that\'s what I\'m trying to figure out. Mark G. Foletta Yes, I think it\'s too soon, Yaron, to guide for margins into -- for the following year. I think we need to kind of get through 2012 and we can certainly provide more guidance there. There is a few things going on. Obviously, you\'ve got some expense inventory that you benefit from but you also have manufacturing inefficiencies that will improve over time as we -- as the production in the plant increases. So let us move through 2012 and watch how this settles out. And the other thing, we\'re giving blended margin. We\'ve got BYETTA at 90%-plus margins. We also need to see how that plays out as we move forward in terms of the mix of BYETTA to our revenues. So it\'s premature to guide really beyond 2012 at this point. Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Right, right. And there\'s going to be the pen in \'13, which is another level of complexity, obviously. So then just a question on BYETTA. Help us understand a little bit. I mean, the price -- the blended price increase in October wasn\'t all that much. It was 5% on the 5 micrograms. So it was in the minority of the pens. And the TRx actually declined, as you noted, quarter-over-quarter, yet BYETTA was actually up. Inventory you said was flat. So help us understand a little bit, what was the -- so what is actually going on? I mean, is IMS just not capturing the meds correctly this quarter or... Mark G. Foletta So you know that there is always an error factor, if you will, in the IMS data. So -- and there\'s also -- we said its inventory levels were comparable. They always adjust a day up, day down. I mean it\'s -- we don\'t get too granular there. And the other thing that you have is you have your gross to nets that we just report net sales. But those tend to move around slightly. So I think it\'s fair to say that this is within the range that we would expect of fluctuation and I think it\'s -- BYETTA had a strong quarter, benefited somewhat from the price, the prescription decline was less than what we experienced sequentially from Q3 to Q2. So the stabilization continued there. And there\'s enough product out there we believe to meet patient demand. Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Okay. If you don\'t mind, just final question. Just to kind of highlight what Mark and Tom were asking about, just so we understand, the net interest expense, the $165 million to $175 million. You said, of that, the $140 million is going to be below the line, right? So I mean, is that the delta? Because whether you -- it sounds like you\'re excluding that from the non-GAAP operating results. Because that\'s going to have an -- as we back into what the top line number is, that delta is pretty important. I\'m just trying to get a sense of that $20 million... Mark G. Foletta Okay. Well, let me make -- Yaron, let me make sure I\'m clear. All of the interest expense will be below the line, and we\'re -- and the other aspects of interest we have besides the RSO, we were just suggesting the RSO would be the majority of the interest expense. The other aspects, clearly, we have a convertible debenture out there and we have the loan from Lilly that\'s out there. So those will be the other elements of interest that were really with us in 2011. So we\'re trying to help you think of the incremental interest expense that will hit our financial statements in 2012, and that\'s the RSO, and we wanted to quantify that magnitude. But this will all fall below the non-GAAP line. You will notice, if you look at our press release that we put out today, we have included an additional reconciliation table for net non-GAAP results. Because of this, primarily -- for a few reasons, but primarily because the deal accounting that had a significant expense in the fourth quarter and to help, because we\'re starting to get that non-cash interest flowing through our books as well. So -- but it\'ll all be below the non-GAAP line that we\'ve guided. Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division But the interest in 2011 was negative $52 million. The interest expense of $52 million. So it sounds like that\'s going to $165 million to $175 million, and that\'s going to hit your net income line and then we got to adjust for that in non-GAAP. Is this -- because, I think, it\'s a little confusing. Mark G. Foletta Yes. So the increase in the interest is because of the RSO. We had 1 month of the RSO in the -- in 2011, we\'ll have 12 months in 2012. But yes, it\'s all below the non-GAAP line. So I want to make sure we\'re clear, though. We will record actual payments on the RSO to an earlier question and it\'s contemplated in our guidance through the non-GAAP results. But the interest expense will be below the line. So yes, maybe we can have a follow-up if that\'s still not clear, Yaron, after the call is done. Operator The next question is from Phil Nadeau with Cowen. Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division So just a follow-up to Yaron\'s. So when you make a payment on the RSO, the 15% royalty on BYETTA and BYDUREON, that does -- that is included in non-GAAP, but the other kind of more amorphous GAAP interest expense associated with the RSO, that\'s in fact what\'s below the line. Do I have that correct? Mark G. Foletta Yes. Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division Okay, perfect. And then on BYETTA, just kind of question on patient dynamics there. Could you give us some sense of what your most recent data suggest about patients who are new to BYETTA in any year? So of the $500 million or so of BYETTA sales this year, how many of those -- what proportion of that is patients who had been adherent to BYETTA in prior years versus how much churn was there? How many patients new to BYETTA would be -- would make up that number? Dan Bradbury So it\'s a great question, Phil. It\'s actually very difficult to actually line up your sales numbers, your script numbers and then also looking at patients. Compliance is a challenge in all chronic diseases, and we know that over a 12-month period in the diabetes space and certainly, we\'ve seen this with BYETTA, is that approximately half the patients who start a product at the beginning of the year will be on the product at the end of the year. And of course, given that BYETTA has been in the market now for multiple years, you\'ve got several -- you\'ve got a lot of dynamics going on there. But one of the things that\'s most pleasing to me, and I was just commenting on it earlier today to our Chief Commercial Officer, was when you look at the NRxs for BYETTA, they\'re actually very consistent. We\'re seeing now very consistent NRxs over time. And that will change with the launch of BYDUREON, I\'d expect. But certainly, over the last 6 months, you\'ve seen a very consistent NRx. So I think you\'ve hit probably a fairly steady state with regards to new patients coming on, patients coming off. Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division Okay. I guess, what I\'m -- well, you can guess I\'m trying to back into, is every new patient will now buy BYDUREON instead of BYETTA, kind of what sales [indiscernible]. Dan Bradbury Yes, so again, one of the -- I think, one of the things there is the -- it\'s really to talk about potentially maybe the opportunity that we have with BYDUREON. I think one of the things that we saw in the clinical studies was incredible adherence and also continuation of patients following the discontinuation of the studies into the extension phases of the studies. One of the things that is interesting is that injectable products in general in the diabetes space have had lower compliance, including, quite surprisingly, given that they\'re life-saving in many patients, including insulins compared with orals. I think one of the major opportunities we have with BYDUREON is the opportunity to see an increase in adherence and compliance. And that\'s something certainly that we will be looking for going forward. There\'s a couple of reasons for that. Firstly, of course, the very attractive feature of it being only dosed once a week. But secondly, also because there\'s no dose adjustment and also there\'s dosing timing flexibility. And of course, you don\'t have to increase the amount of blood glucose monitoring that you\'re doing as a result of going on BYDUREON. So all of those things, we believe, will contribute to enabling patients to actually adhere more effectively to the dosing regimen of BYDUREON. I think a further factor that is important as well is tolerability. We\'ve seen extremely good tolerability to BYDUREON in the studies and in -- and also in feedback from patients who have been on the studies in terms of how they felt about being on BYDUREON. So those factors combined should lead us to an improvement in terms of adherence and persistence to the product. Operator Unfortunately, we are out of time for questions today. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Dan Bradbury for final comments. Dan Bradbury Well, again, thank you very much indeed to everybody for your interest and for your questions today. We have a huge opportunity to continue to advance our mission of discovering, developing and commercializing medicines to improve the lives of patients. Additionally, our leadership team and the many dedicated employees of Amylin remain focused both on building the business today and laying the necessary foundation for success tomorrow. If you have any additional questions, please call Christine or Jeff, the members of our IR team. Thank you. Operator Thank you for participating in today\'s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Thank you!', 'qAndAText': 'Operator [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Jim Birchenough of BMO Capital. Jim Birchenough - BMO Capital Markets U.S. Congratulations to Michael, and I\'ve got a couple of questions. Just first on the accounting for the RSO and that 15% of exenatide sales. Can you confirm again how that 15% is hitting the P&L, if at all? It was hard to follow all the numbers there, but I just want to confirm that you\'re offloading the partnership expense. And I want to know where you\'re accounting for the 15% RSO as a cash payment to Lilly. And then just a second question, as you think about the BYDUREON launch, could you maybe talk to what proportion of patients you think might be warehoused right now? We\'ve seen some launches where we\'ve had the initial bolus. Maybe if you could comment on that dynamic, if you think it\'s going to play out or if it\'s going to be a slow build. Dan Bradbury Hi, Jim. Firstly, thanks for congratulating Michael. We\'re excited about him taking on that new role. I\'ll pass your RSO question over to Mark in a second. Maybe just to answer your second question about potential patients being warehoused for the BYDUREON launch, we actually don\'t have a specific number that I can give you there, but what I can tell you is that without doubt and in my experience and I think in Vince\'s experience, we\'ve never actually been involved in a launch where awareness of a new product was as high as it was for BYDUREON. Now clearly, that\'s a consequence of a number of factors. The products\' features and benefits, of course, are key to that but also, of course, the time that it has been -- it was in the regulatory review also contributed to that. So I think you\'re right, there are patients who are waiting to come on BYDUREON. I just can\'t give you a number at this point. Mark, perhaps you could comment on the RSO? Mark G. Foletta Sure, Jim. We did record the revenue sharing obligation for GAAP purposes to our balance sheet as debt. However -- and we will be amortizing that at 15% of exenatide sales. We did say, on our non-GAAP guidance, though, that we will include that 15% RSO payment against our non-GAAP results. That was contemplated in the guidance that we gave of $20 million to $40 million non-GAAP loss -- operating loss in 2012. Operator Next question is from Tom Russo of Baird. Thomas J. Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Your competitor earnings call recently provided a macro outlook for the segment about doubling to a 10% share by dollars and contemplating kind of their market share expectations. Just wondering if you would be willing to provide your outlook for the segment growth and any market share expectations that you have from your end, long-term expectations. Dan Bradbury Yes, hi, Tom, thanks for the question. We have not given and do not intend to give specific guidance with regards to our expectation. I think that what we can say, however, is consistent with that competitive comment is that we do expect to see the GLP-1 market grow substantially. And certainly, I thought it was interesting to comment with regards to market share because when one does the math, that would be a very substantial position for Amylin relative to our current position in the market globally. So -- but that all having been said, at this point, I think we can see the market now is already over $2 billion and growing at a very substantial rate. Thomas J. Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Okay. And then last but real quick, what\'s left to complete between now and filing the pen early enough such that it could be potentially be improved -- approved by the fourth quarter? What\'s left between now and filing? Dan Bradbury Just a few things, really. We\'re completing some stability work. We have to have a certain amount of stability work completed, and then, of course, there\'s the compilation of the application itself. Those are the 2 kind of major factors. And we don\'t see any challenges with completing those in time to have the pen available by the end of this year or early next year. Operator The quest the next question is from Ian Somaiya of Piper Jaffray. M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division I was hoping to touch base or have you revisit the idea of awareness. Can you give us some qualitative feedback you\'re getting from physicians or at or even on the patient side regarding BYDUREON? And I just have a question for Mark on the financials. Dan Bradbury Sure, hi, Ian. Well, I think from a qualitative point of view, certainly, I think maybe I can maybe talk to some of the comments from some of our salespeople last week at the launch meeting. I mean, they spontaneously receive phone calls from physicians asking when they would be able to prescribe, when the products would be available. The interesting thing as well is when we\'ve done market research, our physicians actually call out the BYDUREON brand by name. So it\'s not just talking to a generic name or some theoretical product. They\'re already aware of the brand, and that\'s been very consistent over the last 6 to 9 months. So we\'re feeling very pleased about that and that certainly does give us a very strong situation. From a patient perspective, I mean, certainly, I guess anecdotally, I\'ve had number of patients asking me directly. We\'ve seen postings on blogs across social media networks as well as across the infamous investor blogs as well, with regarding when they would be available. And I think as I said earlier, you\'ve also had patients who have gone into physicians which have then resulted in calls to us saying when can physicians ask for the product and when will it be available. And as I said on the -- in my prepared remarks, we believe, product -- we believe, we know, product will be available in pharmacies by the 17th of February. M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Okay. And what type of -- what level of inventory do you anticipate being held by your [indiscernible] Mark G. Foletta Ian, could you be more specific, what do you mean being held? M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Well, I mean, just given the launch, given the awareness, I mean, what type of inventory should we assume? Mark G. Foletta Yes, so we have been making inventory, as you know, certainly for the OUS market. And be -- and have certainly begun to put inventory together for the U.S. market. As Dan said, we expect it in the market by the end of next week. We have said that typically, you have a bolus of product that gets launched. And yes, it\'s usually around somewhere around 4 weeks that -- at the outset. So we would expect to see the shipments of that relatively soon here, and then, future orders will come based upon demand. Given the timing of this, we\'ll certainly provide more -- further outlook on this when we get to our Q1 call in April, because we\'ll have a good sense of what the channel is looking like then. M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division And I guess, the question was more related to also how much inventory do you have on hand to supply the market? Dan Bradbury Well, maybe -- I mean, we have plenty of inventory available to put 4 weeks worth of product into distributors, which is what we would aim to do before the -- in the next week or so. Mark G. Foletta Yes, so we were building inventory in the fourth quarter. And I may remind you that we actually had some inventory that was available actually 1 year ago that can be used in the marketplace, a little over 1 year ago, following our second complete response, so -- which isn\'t actually even on the books. So anyway, we have plenty of inventory to support the market. Operator The next question is from Mark Schoenebaum with ISI. Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Hey, Mark, we\'re going to miss you on calls. There\'ll be nobody to confuse all the biotech analysts with accounting jargon. Michael York No, you\'re still going to have me. Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Hey, I was -- number one -- I just had like -- I had 4 questions, but they\'re really short. Number one, why the decision to not get any explicit sales guidance? And number two, this is always dangerous because I\'m really bad at math, but when I take your guidance and try to back out what you guys imply for revenue for the company, I get to something like $660 million to $680 million, which is like low single-digit growth for total company revenue over 2011. So wondering if my math is right and why such low growth? Do you expect a lot of cannibalization at first? And then any help on the CapEx line for this year? And then finally, one for Dan. The pen that\'s you\'re -- that\'s going to be approved in the next, call it, 12 months, how exactly is that different from the weekly suspension? Like what exactly is this pen? Can you literally describe it for us to help us understand what kind of impact it would have in the marketplace versus the weekly suspension? Dan Bradbury Yes, sure. So just to give Mark some time to do some back-of-the-envelope calculations there, Mark, to come up with your numbers, I\'ll answer the last question first. So with the pen is actually going to be one which is made up of a single jeweled chamber cartridge. In those, the 2 chambers of the cartridge, 1 chamber will have the microspheres and then the other chamber will have the diluent. When a patient uses the pen, it will be a simple case of essentially actuating the cartridge so that the diluent goes into the microsphere chamber. The patient then would then suspend the microspheres by shaking the pen and then they\'d be able to inject. So it\'s all in a single device. Now the big difference with the suspension is that the suspension already has microspheres suspended in a different diluent, which is possible to do because of the uniqueness of that formulation. So it actually takes out of the step the reconstitution of the microspheres. Okay, is that clear? Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division That\'s great. That helps a lot. Dan Bradbury Okay. Now, Mark, over to you for the questions... Mark G. Foletta I\'ll take -- first, I\'ll take the lack... Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division My goal is to stump you as a going-away present, so proceed. Mark G. Foletta I\'m not going anywhere. Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Just kidding. Mark G. Foletta That\'s Michael York. You still get to deal with me Mark. So anyway, with respect to the CapEx, that\'s the easy one. We did have in our prepared remarks, we expect CapEx to be comparable to 2011, and that\'s a number, $26 million approximately, that we had in 2011, and my -- primarily focused around our facility in Ohio. With respect to your back calculation of revenue, I think there is a few things that are at play here. One is obviously, the mix of revenue. We did guide margins, blended margins of 80%, but depending upon the mix of the revenue across our products, BYDUREON, BYETTA and SYMLIN, the revenue number that we have for each product, is -- we have range of forecast for each of those products. And with respect to your back calculation, I don\'t think you\'re thinking about it inaccurately. We certainly would expect early on to have some switching of BYETTA patients to, and potentially Victoza patients to -- into BYDUREON. And as we look to grow the market in -- earlier in the continuum of care, and then we will be promoting BYETTA in the -- with our new indication on top of basal, as we said in the prepared remarks. But we don\'t want to provide specific guidance and I think it really comes down to the mix of the products. But we\'re very bullish on the opportunity, as Dan said earlier, of this market growing and us continuing to secure revenue growth as we move through the year. Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Okay. Sorry I confused you with Michael. Sorry, Michael. Mark G. Foletta No problem. It\'s okay. Operator The next question is from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division So I guess -- so quick question, I guess, accounting questions. So are you re-recording the interest payment associated with the RSO and when do you expect to make those payments? And then second question I had, for the sales force that you\'re bring on from Lilly, are you now going to have permanent contracts for those sales individuals or are they still temporary sales contracts? Dan Bradbury So maybe I\'ll take the second question first. I mean, just to clarify, first and foremost, we\'re not taking on any sales people from Lilly. We actually have hired our own contract sales organization. We have the contracts that will, each person will have in place is a 2-year contract, it will be -- but with a 1-year renewal. So it\'s actually a pretty long-term contract that we\'ll have in place. Although, of course, we always have the opportunity to adjust that if we need to at any time, but there will always are consequences associated with canceling a contract or changing a contract outside of the cycle. Perhaps that you\'re asking the -- your first question regarding interest, Mark, do you want to comment on that? Mark G. Foletta Yes, Robyn, it\'s Mark here. We will be recording interest expense through our income statement on the RSO and the way you should think about it that is it\'ll be -- below the line will be interest cost. We guided that, it was $140 million in 2012 of approximately $160 million to -- $160 million of the total interest expense. So the majority of interest expense we\'d expect this year will be associated with the RSO. And then of course, payments on the RSO, you asked when we would make them. The way the agreement was struck is the first RSO payment for 2012 will not be made until the fourth quarter, the 1-year anniversary of the deal. But we\'ll be accruing that to quarter -- throughout the year, but the first payment will not be made until the fourth quarter. And then we will be making them quarterly thereafter, starting in 2013. And I think I said this, but the interest does get added to the principal, so you\'ll see the RSO obligation that\'s on the books at the end of the year at $977 million grow throughout the year. Operator Next question is from Cory Kasimov of JPMC. Cory William Kasimov - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division I realized it\'s only been 1 week, but can you describe the initial reaction from payers regarding the price of BYDUREON? Dan Bradbury So with the caveat, yes, it has only been 1 week. I would just say that I think we\'ve had positive reactions so far. We\'ve had a number of calls from payers keen to meet with our managed care organization team. And I would say, Cory, that the pricing strategy that we are adopting -- we\'ve adopted for BYDUREON, I think, has been well received to-date. But I would then say -- I go back, say, it is early. And certainly, we\'re at the stage now where people are wanting proposals and they also want the dossier, of course, that we prepared to enable them to get to review as soon as possible. Cory William Kasimov - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Okay. And then for Mark, on OpEx, can you talk a little bit about the dynamics behind the drop in R&D from the third quarter to fourth quarter of 2011? And then, if the relative breakdown between R&D and SG&A is going to be similar in 2012 as it was in Q4. Mark G. Foletta Yes. So let me first take the first question first, Cory. With respect to the drop of R&D costs in the fourth quarter, that was somewhat related to, we mentioned in the prepared remarks, settlement of some ongoing cost-sharing disputes with Lilly that we resolved during the quarter. So I wouldn\'t look at that as a sustainable level. And obviously, we\'re -- we\'ve guided that we\'ll be adding expenses as a result of the full support of activities on the R&D side and the commercial side in 2012. So please refer to that guidance of $600 million to $625 million of GAAP expenses. With respect to the proportion of those expenses being SG&A versus R&D, I think the way to think about that is it would be comparable to the proportion that we had in 2011 with the caveat that it is a launch year, so they might be slightly weighted towards the sales and marketing side. Cory William Kasimov - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Okay. And then lastly, you\'re responsible for up to, I believe, $60 million in the European operating loss. Are you able to quantify for us in any way kind of where that stands right now in terms of the profitability or lack thereof of the European operations for Lilly? Dan Bradbury So Cory, you\'re absolutely right. We are responsible up to a maximum of $60 million over 2 years to the end of 2013. Obviously, if-- there are multiple factors that affect that. So once we are able to establish a new OUS partnership, that would change the dynamic with respect to the exposure to that. I think the other thing there is as well, we are working very closely with Lilly to control those expenses and agree on what those expenses associated with the launches of BYDUREON outside the United States, and the ongoing expenses associated with the promotion of BYDUREON and BYETTA outside of the United States are. So I would say that, that is a maximum number and we do not have full expectation that, that will be what we will finally book. That having been said, at this point, given the variables that are affecting it, it\'s not possible to guide to a precise number. Mark G. Foletta Cory, the only thing I\'ll add there is that we did mention in the prepared remarks that in the context of our accounting for this transaction, that we actually estimated, we were conservative and actually built that into the accounting so it\'s -- of approximately $45 million really using kind of a present value and a probable concept, if you will. And so you will not see material amounts flowing to our P&L on this. And to the extent this gets revalued, it actually will be done kind of outside of the operations of the company going forward. Operator Next question is from Thomas Wei of Jefferies. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division I wanted to ask a couple of questions. The first just on the guidance and some of the math that we\'re all trying to do on the fly here. Actually, I got 2 slightly different numbers than Mark did. And basically, it looks to me like you would need combined BYETTA, BYDUREON sales to grow roughly 15% to 20%-ish. So maybe something like $600 million in combined franchise sales, is that the right way of thinking about things? And given the fact that, that seems much higher than maybe what street expectations were for and certainly relative to the current rate of BYETTA prescription decline, I guess, I\'m interested to understand a little bit better what the thought process was behind that. Dan Bradbury So Thomas, maybe I can comment on that. Well, I just reiterate that we don\'t provide specific revenue guidance. And obviously, you guys have to do your own work with respect to what your expectations with regards to revenue. However, I would reiterate that we continue to have high level of confidence in the launch of BYDUREON. We do expect that it will grow share of the GLP-1 market. And we also expect that BYETTA will -- although we expect there will be some cannibalization with BYDUREON and BYETTA, we do expect that BYETTA will establish its own market, the short-acting GLP-1 market, which will contribute to our 2012 results. So I think that you\'ve done some pretty elegant math there, and it\'s up to yourself, really, to finalize what you think what your numbers will be. But I would say that we do continue to be confident in the launch of BYDUREON. I\'ll let Mark... Mark G. Foletta Yes, the only thing I\'ll add is I suspect the differences that you guys are calculating possibly is in how you\'re -- the level of sales you\'re assuming, and we have said the 15% of exenatide sales will be -- flow through our non-GAAP results, that\'s the RSO payment. And so maybe, that\'s a factor that\'s in the mix as well. And of course, we also have SYMLIN, which did slightly over $100 million in 2012 -- or \'11, I\'m sorry. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division I think I\'ve accounted for the 15% correctly. But maybe just on the kind of on the bigger picture here, is part of -- when you set out to give us this guidance, you obviously have your own expectations built in, otherwise you couldn\'t have given us non-GAAP operating loss guidance. Did you base that on how -- do you only have one market worth of data for BYDUREON launch, that would be in Germany. Is that kind of what you used as the proxy for uptick or do you model BYETTA, BYDUREON dynamics in the U.S. very differently from the way that it\'s gone in Germany so far? Dan Bradbury So we certainly haven\'t used Germany as the proxy for the United States. We built our own model for the United States. I think you have to look at those markets and remember that they\'re very different in terms of patient access from day 1. In Germany, once a product is approved, that product is freely available. I shouldn\'t say, freely available, but is available widely across the entire healthcare system to all physicians to prescribe. That is not the case here in the United States, as you know. And there is a period of time where there\'s a lag in availability of the product directly to patients through their various different -- depending on the structure of their healthcare plans. So we built our own model, which is very -- I can tell you, very complicated and sophisticated based on individual plan access and the timing of individual plan access, as well as modeling other product launches recently and how those products have been taken up. So it\'s a little bit more complicated than that, Thomas, I guess, is probably the bottom line. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division And maybe if I\'m... Mark G. Foletta Tom, I have one more comment to maybe help. We did give a range of $25 million for GAAP operating expenses as well. So probably the way to think about where we\'ll be in that range is somewhat how we\'ll be at the top line. So you probably would think they would be higher in that range than the expense range if we were at the higher range of our forecast and vice versa. And we did also guide the non-GAAP number to pull out of the GAAP operating expenses. And that\'s going up to $105 million to $115 million. So I know there\'s a lot of math that you\'re having to do and you haven\'t had a lot of time to do it, but those are additional factors to consider. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division That\'s helpful. And then maybe, Dan, maybe just to follow-up on what you just -- we\'re talking about, does that -- the way that you described it, it sounds like you have modeled for less aggressive BYDUREON uptake in the U.S. than maybe what we\'ve seen so far in Germany. That would be my takeaway from what you\'ve said. Is that fair? Dan Bradbury Well, I think, yes. I think that\'s true. Because in Germany, you can expect to see access very quickly. That having been said, of course, one, you have to take into account, Tom, I mean, the U.S. market, significantly greater than the German market in terms of size. And so even for -- even in the United States, the size of the early access group, if you like, is extremely large. And so we don\'t see access per se being a major challenge early on. It\'s something that we would -- because many plans, by the way, have a period of time where they make -- enable product to be available until they\'ve established their rules. That having been said, there are plans where that\'s not the case. So you can\'t just do a straight proportional sort of, "This is what it\'s like in Germany and this is what\'s it\'s going to be like in the United States." It\'s a bit more complicated. Operator Next question is from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division I just wanted to confirm that until you establish a new marketing partner, ex-U.S., that the revenues that you\'ll recognize in the foreseeable future here are the legacy royalty rate that you had with the Lilly for sales of BYETTA and BYDUREON. Is that correct? Dan Bradbury Yes, Steve. Yes, that is correct. Mark G. Foletta Yes, that\'s correct, Steve, and we guided that as -- in the absence of the transition to a new partner in 2012, we guided that at less than $5 million. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Okay. And Mark, I recall that one time, you talked about the Ohio plant. This is, well, pre-approval. But in the -- and it has fixed cost that were somewhere in the $100 million a year range, is that correct? And how are you -- how has the accounting on that changed post-approval and the termination of the Lilly agreement? Mark G. Foletta Well, that is correct, that we have fixed cost of approximately $100 million. We did say that approximately half of those were non-cash depreciation. In the fourth quarter, we did begin to capitalize some of those costs to the extent that they previously were going to flow into our P&L and we\'re sharing them with Lilly. And then as we got -- as we began to make some inventory towards the end of the year, we\'ve began to capitalize some of those. And clearly and as we move into 2012, we will be recording those costs on the balance sheet, understanding that, that will then impact the BYDUREON cost of goods sold because those -- some of those could -- we have a capacity, obviously, to build a lot of units. And as the manufacturing ramps up, the cost per unit will be higher, so we\'ll have some cogs impact, the higher that we\'ve talked about earlier, higher cogs, lower gross margins. But there\'s really -- I guess, to summarize the changes, it is now going into inventory. It\'s no longer, obviously, being shared with Lilly. But a significant amount of that -- of those fixed costs are non-cash depreciation. So our cash margins will be higher than what we\'ve guided. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division And that roughly 80% gross margin that you talked about, that was kind of an all-in with all the products, does that include these fixed costs for the Ohio plant? Mark G. Foletta Yes, it does. So it\'s a blended margin for the products and it does include an element of non-cash depreciation. So that\'s why I said that our cash margins will be higher. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division And was some of the R&D stepdown due to a shift out of those depreciation expenses after the approval? Mark G. Foletta No. Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division It was in R&D and moving forward, it would move out of there? Mark G. Foletta Yes. So that is -- to an earlier question about R&D I mean, that is one reason why R&D will decline, because we\'ll no longer be recording those costs through R&D. I had mentioned in a response to an earlier question that the biggest reason for the decline sequentially was to resolution of a cost-sharing dispute. But a smaller reason was the fact was that some of those costs that used to flow through R&D are now flowing into the balance sheet. You should think about that as you think about R&D levels in 2012. Operator The next question is from Yaron Werber from Citigroup. Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Congrats for approval, and Michael, congrats on moving on. I can see your smile all the way from here that you\'re not going to deal with us anymore. Dan Bradbury He\'s going to miss you. Don\'t worry. Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Michael, give me your number, I\'ll call you. So just -- I have a quick question on -- actually, 2 quick questions. So one, just to follow on Steve\'s question, has to do with -- just so we understand, did you have a chance to pre-expense inventory in the past? And so essentially, the 80% gross margin, is that going to be essentially, including some pre-expense inventory which you\'re not going to be essentially paying for now, and so should we think of it as a good steady-state into next year? Or I\'m just trying to sense how much of that has been pre-expense? And then, I have a follow-up, too. Dan Bradbury I\'ll say, Mark, over to you. Mark G. Foletta Okay. Yaron, we did say, in fact, it was-- respond to an earlier question that there is some inventory that was pre-expense associated with the second complete response letter in late 2010. And that will work its way into our supply chain, into our product. But that\'s contemplated in the 80% margins that we guided. Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division So does that mean that as we think of next year, we should assume that some of that pre-expensed inventory is not going to be there anymore, and so we should think of -- is that going up? Essentially, that\'s what I\'m trying to figure out. Mark G. Foletta Yes, I think it\'s too soon, Yaron, to guide for margins into -- for the following year. I think we need to kind of get through 2012 and we can certainly provide more guidance there. There is a few things going on. Obviously, you\'ve got some expense inventory that you benefit from but you also have manufacturing inefficiencies that will improve over time as we -- as the production in the plant increases. So let us move through 2012 and watch how this settles out. And the other thing, we\'re giving blended margin. We\'ve got BYETTA at 90%-plus margins. We also need to see how that plays out as we move forward in terms of the mix of BYETTA to our revenues. So it\'s premature to guide really beyond 2012 at this point. Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Right, right. And there\'s going to be the pen in \'13, which is another level of complexity, obviously. So then just a question on BYETTA. Help us understand a little bit. I mean, the price -- the blended price increase in October wasn\'t all that much. It was 5% on the 5 micrograms. So it was in the minority of the pens. And the TRx actually declined, as you noted, quarter-over-quarter, yet BYETTA was actually up. Inventory you said was flat. So help us understand a little bit, what was the -- so what is actually going on? I mean, is IMS just not capturing the meds correctly this quarter or... Mark G. Foletta So you know that there is always an error factor, if you will, in the IMS data. So -- and there\'s also -- we said its inventory levels were comparable. They always adjust a day up, day down. I mean it\'s -- we don\'t get too granular there. And the other thing that you have is you have your gross to nets that we just report net sales. But those tend to move around slightly. So I think it\'s fair to say that this is within the range that we would expect of fluctuation and I think it\'s -- BYETTA had a strong quarter, benefited somewhat from the price, the prescription decline was less than what we experienced sequentially from Q3 to Q2. So the stabilization continued there. And there\'s enough product out there we believe to meet patient demand. Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Okay. If you don\'t mind, just final question. Just to kind of highlight what Mark and Tom were asking about, just so we understand, the net interest expense, the $165 million to $175 million. You said, of that, the $140 million is going to be below the line, right? So I mean, is that the delta? Because whether you -- it sounds like you\'re excluding that from the non-GAAP operating results. Because that\'s going to have an -- as we back into what the top line number is, that delta is pretty important. I\'m just trying to get a sense of that $20 million... Mark G. Foletta Okay. Well, let me make -- Yaron, let me make sure I\'m clear. All of the interest expense will be below the line, and we\'re -- and the other aspects of interest we have besides the RSO, we were just suggesting the RSO would be the majority of the interest expense. The other aspects, clearly, we have a convertible debenture out there and we have the loan from Lilly that\'s out there. So those will be the other elements of interest that were really with us in 2011. So we\'re trying to help you think of the incremental interest expense that will hit our financial statements in 2012, and that\'s the RSO, and we wanted to quantify that magnitude. But this will all fall below the non-GAAP line. You will notice, if you look at our press release that we put out today, we have included an additional reconciliation table for net non-GAAP results. Because of this, primarily -- for a few reasons, but primarily because the deal accounting that had a significant expense in the fourth quarter and to help, because we\'re starting to get that non-cash interest flowing through our books as well. So -- but it\'ll all be below the non-GAAP line that we\'ve guided. Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division But the interest in 2011 was negative $52 million. The interest expense of $52 million. So it sounds like that\'s going to $165 million to $175 million, and that\'s going to hit your net income line and then we got to adjust for that in non-GAAP. Is this -- because, I think, it\'s a little confusing. Mark G. Foletta Yes. So the increase in the interest is because of the RSO. We had 1 month of the RSO in the -- in 2011, we\'ll have 12 months in 2012. But yes, it\'s all below the non-GAAP line. So I want to make sure we\'re clear, though. We will record actual payments on the RSO to an earlier question and it\'s contemplated in our guidance through the non-GAAP results. But the interest expense will be below the line. So yes, maybe we can have a follow-up if that\'s still not clear, Yaron, after the call is done. Operator The next question is from Phil Nadeau with Cowen. Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division So just a follow-up to Yaron\'s. So when you make a payment on the RSO, the 15% royalty on BYETTA and BYDUREON, that does -- that is included in non-GAAP, but the other kind of more amorphous GAAP interest expense associated with the RSO, that\'s in fact what\'s below the line. Do I have that correct? Mark G. Foletta Yes. Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division Okay, perfect. And then on BYETTA, just kind of question on patient dynamics there. Could you give us some sense of what your most recent data suggest about patients who are new to BYETTA in any year? So of the $500 million or so of BYETTA sales this year, how many of those -- what proportion of that is patients who had been adherent to BYETTA in prior years versus how much churn was there? How many patients new to BYETTA would be -- would make up that number? Dan Bradbury So it\'s a great question, Phil. It\'s actually very difficult to actually line up your sales numbers, your script numbers and then also looking at patients. Compliance is a challenge in all chronic diseases, and we know that over a 12-month period in the diabetes space and certainly, we\'ve seen this with BYETTA, is that approximately half the patients who start a product at the beginning of the year will be on the product at the end of the year. And of course, given that BYETTA has been in the market now for multiple years, you\'ve got several -- you\'ve got a lot of dynamics going on there. But one of the things that\'s most pleasing to me, and I was just commenting on it earlier today to our Chief Commercial Officer, was when you look at the NRxs for BYETTA, they\'re actually very consistent. We\'re seeing now very consistent NRxs over time. And that will change with the launch of BYDUREON, I\'d expect. But certainly, over the last 6 months, you\'ve seen a very consistent NRx. So I think you\'ve hit probably a fairly steady state with regards to new patients coming on, patients coming off. Philip Nadeau - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division Okay. I guess, what I\'m -- well, you can guess I\'m trying to back into, is every new patient will now buy BYDUREON instead of BYETTA, kind of what sales [indiscernible]. Dan Bradbury Yes, so again, one of the -- I think, one of the things there is the -- it\'s really to talk about potentially maybe the opportunity that we have with BYDUREON. I think one of the things that we saw in the clinical studies was incredible adherence and also continuation of patients following the discontinuation of the studies into the extension phases of the studies. One of the things that is interesting is that injectable products in general in the diabetes space have had lower compliance, including, quite surprisingly, given that they\'re life-saving in many patients, including insulins compared with orals. I think one of the major opportunities we have with BYDUREON is the opportunity to see an increase in adherence and compliance. And that\'s something certainly that we will be looking for going forward. There\'s a couple of reasons for that. Firstly, of course, the very attractive feature of it being only dosed once a week. But secondly, also because there\'s no dose adjustment and also there\'s dosing timing flexibility. And of course, you don\'t have to increase the amount of blood glucose monitoring that you\'re doing as a result of going on BYDUREON. So all of those things, we believe, will contribute to enabling patients to actually adhere more effectively to the dosing regimen of BYDUREON. I think a further factor that is important as well is tolerability. We\'ve seen extremely good tolerability to BYDUREON in the studies and in -- and also in feedback from patients who have been on the studies in terms of how they felt about being on BYDUREON. So those factors combined should lead us to an improvement in terms of adherence and persistence to the product. Operator Unfortunately, we are out of time for questions today. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Dan Bradbury for final comments. Dan Bradbury Well, again, thank you very much indeed to everybody for your interest and for your questions today. We have a huge opportunity to continue to advance our mission of discovering, developing and commercializing medicines to improve the lives of patients. Additionally, our leadership team and the many dedicated employees of Amylin remain focused both on building the business today and laying the necessary foundation for success tomorrow. If you have any additional questions, please call Christine or Jeff, the members of our IR team. Thank you. Operator Thank you for participating in today\'s conference call. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce your host, Christine Everett-Zedelmayer, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Christine Everett-Zedelmayer Good morning, and welcome to Amylin Pharmaceuticals' quarterly update conference call. We have uploaded a presentation to the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at amylin.com to accompany this conference call that provides additional background on the quarter. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are outlined in today's press release, the website presentation and in our recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our actual results could differ materially from what is discussed on today's call. Let me introduce the other members of the Amylin management team here today: Daniel Bradbury, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Foletta, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Vince Mihalik, Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing and Chief Commercial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Dan Bradbury. Daniel M. Bradbury Thanks, Christine, and welcome to our first quarter call for 2012. This morning, our comments will build on the press release issued earlier today. In a few moments, Mark will provide additional details on the quarter's financial results and comment on our outlook and guidance for the remainder of 2012. Vince will then review our commercial activity and progress during the first quarter, including an overview of the U.S. BYDUREON launch. 2012 has been a truly exciting year for us so far. We've made substantial progress against many of our key corporate priorities for the year and look forward to continued momentum as we forge ahead. I would like to take a moment to reflect upon the numerous developments during the course of the first quarter. First and foremost, we accomplished a long-held goal of ours, bringing the first and only, once-weekly therapy, BYDUREON, to type 2 diabetes patients in the United States. This therapy is now approved in 35 markets around the world and has launched in 15 to date. With this game-changing therapy, we are providing patients with an opportunity to control their diabetes instead of letting their diabetes control them. With BYDUREON, we have set a new bar for the treatment options that we believe will start further innovation and advancements that will continue to revolutionize the development of future therapies for people with diabetes.  Having gained approval for BYDUREON in the United States in late January, we immediately began executing our comprehensive launch plan. With the hard work of the Amylin organization and all our suppliers, BYDUREON was available to patients within 12 business days of approval. We were able to fulfill the immediate orders from wholesalers and enabled dispensing of prescriptions from physicians interested in offering this innovative treatment option for their patients. We are extremely pleased with the performance of BYDUREON thus far, and are highly encouraged with the uptick in demand as BYDUREON continues to gain market share and expand the GLP-1 class.  Specifically, we're encouraged by the response from the high-prescribing, highly-influential physicians, that we have initially targeted. By following this approach, we are building a strong foundation of long-term growth and adoption within the medical community. We are now 10 weeks into the launch of BYDUREON in the U.S. and it has gained more than 5% of the GLP-1 market. This growth is an addition to BYETTA maintaining 38% market share, establishing its new position in the short-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist class as the only product indicated to be added to the world's best-selling basal insulin. With prescriptions for GLP-1 receptor agonists having grown by nearly 60% since February 2010 and the class now approaching 2 billion in global sales, we believe that awareness of the benefits of GLP-1 therapy is at an all-time high. Our focus is on continuing to grow the GLP-1 receptor agonist class through the promotion of our Exenatide franchise.  With BYDUREON, we have the unique opportunity to grow and shape the long-acting GLP-1 market and with BYETTA, the only GLP-1 receptor agonist indicated to be added to the world's best-selling basal insulin, we have the opportunity to establish a new market with short-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists. We believe our early success is the result of our 2 recently created dedicated commercial units, the Exenatide commercial unit and the specialty and orphan disease commercial units, each with its own focused sales force, enabling us to devote sufficient attention to our entire product portfolio. We now have a total of 650 reps hired, trained and in the field, supporting Exenatide, and an additional 65 reps trained and in the field detailing SYMLIN and BYETTA. Vince will provide more detail on commercial activities and the BYDUREON U.S. launch specifics later in the call. Additionally, the European commission recently granted marketing authorization to BYETTA as adjunctive therapy to basal insulin, with or without metformin and/or pioglitazone, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults who have not achieved adequate glycemic control using these agents. This indication gives patients and physicians an important new treatment option providing improved glycemic control with the potential for weight loss and without an increased risk of hypoglycemia. We are pleased with this expansion to the BYETTA label in the EU market.  During the quarter, we also continue to make important progress in advancing our development pipeline. This quarter, we completed the Biologics license application or BLA in the U.S. for the use of metreleptin to treat diabetes and/or high levels of triglycerides in patients with rare forms of lipodystrophy. This important milestone brings us one step closer to delivering this novel therapy to patients living with this serious and potentially life-threatening ultra-orphan disease who currently have limited treatment options. We anticipate hearing the response to our request for priority review this quarter. If designated as a priority review, metreleptin could be commercially available to patients by the end of this year. We are also continuing our progress of Exenatide lifecycle options that provide patients with additional choices in delivery devices. The development of a pen device for BYDUREON remains on track, with an expected launch by the end of 2012 or in early 2013. Additionally, we are advancing the Exenatide suspension programs, including weekly and monthly formulations that do not require new suspension. These product candidates represent an important component of the Exenatide franchise and the next leg in the evolution of the GLP-1 market.  Based on end of Phase II discussions with the U.S. FDA at the end of 2011, we remain on track to start the Phase III program of the once-weekly suspension in the middle of 2012. We are actively engaged with global regulatory agencies for input into the Phase III design for the once-monthly suspension and plan to start the global program in early 2013. We are also continuing to add census and enroll patients for our ongoing EXSCEL cardiovascular outcome study, which is investigating the potential for BYDUREON to reduce cardiovascular events relative to the standard of care in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our efforts to secure a partner outside the United States with Exenatide are ongoing, and interests from both global and regional companies remains very high.  Finally, we continue to maintain our focused financial discipline. As Mark will highlight momentarily, our first quarter financial results reflect our commitment to executing our plans towards BYDUREON. Our expenses in 2012 are front loaded to maximize the opportunity for success. As reflected by the full year guidance Mark will provide, we remain committed to controlling our spending and driving operational efficiencies within the business. I'll now turn things over to Mark to review our financial results released earlier today. Mark G. Foletta Thanks, Dan and good morning. Today, we announced our financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2012. I'll begin my comments by discussing our quarterly performance, including comparing quarter-over-quarter changes in revenues, I will then close out my comments with an update regarding the guidance we provided during our 2011 year-end call in February. As we continue to make progress with the launch of BYDUREON, we remain focused on managing the business with operational discipline and optimizing our use of cash. The key metric to track our financial progress continues to be non-GAAP operating results, which approximates our cash flow from operations before working capital changes. Our non-GAAP operating results are defined as our GAAP operating results, excluding restructuring charges and noncash items comprised of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets and fair value adjustments.  Additionally, we now include in this metric the 15% obligation on Exenatide global sales, also known as our revenue sharing obligation or RSO. In the first quarter of 2012, our non-GAAP operating loss was $30.1 million. Total revenues declined $11.3 million or 7% from the fourth quarter to up $153.7 million. The change in total revenues reflects declines in BYETTA and SYMLIN revenues of 9% and 18%, respectively, offset by the addition of BYDUREON to our product mix. The 9% sequential decline in BYETTA revenue reflects the 4% decline in prescription volume and variations in gross to net adjustments and wholesale inventory levels that were within normal ranges and our expectations.  The 18% sequential decline in SYMLIN revenue reflects a 10% decrease in prescription volume and variations in gross net adjustments and wholesale inventory levels that also were within normal ranges and our expectations. BYDUREON, which we launched in mid-February in the United States, generated $6.9 million of revenue in the first quarter. These early results include the initial stocking of wholesale distribution channel. I'd like to note that the initial channel fill, following approval, was the only shipment of BYDUREON during the first quarter and we began receiving reorders very early in the second quarter as demand for BYDUREON increased. This was consistent with our pull strategy, not to overstock the distribution channel while meeting patient demand and ensuring sequential, quarterly growth of BYDUREON revenue.  Gross margins during the quarter were 77%, down from 92% in the fourth quarter of 2011. As expected, the main driver of our lower gross margin during the quarter was the launch of BYDUREON. As we have guided previously, BYDUREON will initially have margins significantly below our target of 75%, mainly due to approximately $100 million of annual fixed operating expenses to run our Ohio manufacturing facility. As expected, cost of goods sold for BYDUREON exceeded revenue in the first quarter. But we expect BYDUREON gross profit and margins to improve as production volume increases and we realize economies of scale. Our operating expenses were $161.5 million in the first quarter, consisting of $110.3 million of selling, general and administrative expenses, and $51.2 million of research and development expenses. Due to recent significant changes in our operating model, we are not comparing operating expenses to prior periods.  We ended the first quarter with $315 million in cash, restricted cash and investments, which includes proceeds of $207 million from the sale of approximately 13.5 million common shares in the secondary offering last month. Following the offering, our outstanding share count stands at approximately 163 million shares as of March 31, 2012. Now let me move to our expectations for the remainder of 2012. While our non-GAAP operating loss in the first quarter was $30.1 million, driven largely by investments to support the launch of BYDUREON, we still expect to finish the year with accumulated non-GAAP operating loss of between $20 million and $40 million. We continue to maintain our 2012 combined operating expense guidance of $600 million to $625 million. Operating expenses in the first quarter of $161.5 million is slightly above the rate of planned spending for the remainder of the year as a result of nonrecurring cost associated with the launch of BYDUREON. I will now provide some further quantitative and qualitative guidance to assist you in understanding our expectations for 2012.  Collaborative revenues, consisting of the amortization of the upfront payment we received from Takeda as part of our obesity collaboration will be $7.5 million. We expect royalties on Exenatide gross margin outside of the United States to be less than $5 million. We expect combined gross margins for BYETTA, BYDUREON and SYMLIN of approximately 80%. We expect net interest expense to be $165 million to $175 million, approximately $140 million of which is associated with the RSO. Noncash adjustments, including depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation are expected to be between $105 million and $115 million. Additionally, we will incur approximately $30 million of amortization of intangible assets that will also be excluded from our non-GAAP operating results. With respect to our cash flow, we offer the following additional comments: We intend to continue to focus on tightly managing our cash in 2012 while investing to support the launch of BYDUREON. Additionally, our first RSO payment for 2012 will not be made until the fourth quarter.  Excluding the $207 million proceeds from our equity offering, we used approximately $107 million of cash in the first quarter. This was driven primarily by working capital usages, including the building of BYDUREON inventories and the payment of year-end accrual. Additionally, the quarter included the final gross margin sharing payment to Lilly for October and November of 2011. As a reminder, the new economic relationship commenced on December 1, 2011. Quarterly, our cash usage was front loaded in the first quarter of 2012 and we expect to use less than $30 million of cash for the remainder of 2012, including the fourth quarter RSO payment I mentioned a moment ago. We expect our capital expenditures to be less than $50 million for 2012.  To summarize, we are pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter of 2012, which reflects our focused discipline to manage expenses closely in line with expected revenues while fully investing to support the BYDUREON launch in the United States.  Now, I will turn the call over to Vince to provide some information regarding our commercial performance during the quarter. Vincent P. Mihalik Thank you, Mark. As Dan mentioned previously, we are very excited and pleased with the launch of BYDUREON in the U.S. With the power of continuous glycemic control, in just one weekly dose, we firmly believe that BYDUREON is a product that represents an opportunity to revolutionize the ways patients and physicians manage type 2 diabetes. We are also very encouraged by the early feedback we are getting from physicians, health care professionals and our field organization. The willingness of physicians, diabetes educators and an office staff to learn about BYDUREON, as a new treatment option in type 2 diabetes, has been encouraging and an early sign of product interest and adoption. Our plan upon approval for BYDUREON in the U.S. was to launch the product as quickly as possible. We are pleased that we had a product available to patients in only 12 business days.  To achieve this goal, we planned for a progressive ramp up of our field teams and a rollout of support tools in the weeks following approval. This ramp up included recruiting, hiring and providing comprehensive training to 325 reps new to Amylin and placing them in the field in less than 90 days, providing intensive product training for all 650 sales reps promoting BYDUREON, working with our suppliers to ensure that adequate levels of trade products were quickly available in the pharmacies at launch and shipping BYDUREON samples to the sales teams as soon as possible.  We are very pleased with the quality of our newly hired 325 sales team members, most of these reps have former diabetes sales experience and on average, have 10-plus years of pharmaceutical or biotech sales experience. Given that this team is new to their target physicians, territory routing and/or products, we expect we will not see the full impact of their activity for another 3 months or more.  Consistent with our strategy to build a blockbuster brand by focusing on specialty first, our analysis of early BYDUREON scripts demonstrates to us that our physician-targeting approach is working. Our field team has been actively calling on endocrinologists and key primary physicians who drive and influence others to write. We are pleased with the adoption and increasing productivity of BYDUREON by these key high decile, highly-influential physicians. Early shifts in NRx share for BYDUREON in the GLP-1 class indicate that demand is building nicely and bodes well for greater adoption of this class and the Exenatide franchise. The majority of scripts are new to the class as opposed to patients switching from an existing GLP-1 option.  Since the launch of BYDUREON in the U.S., 4 weeks [ph] just indicate that the total weekly prescriptions for the GLP-1 class have grown by approximately 7%. We believe that the steady GLP-1 class growth in U.S. is an indicator that the market is willing to adopt new entrants to this important class of therapies and especially BYDUREON, which provides improved efficacy, better tolerability in just one weekly dose. Indeed, today, we are seeing new prescriptions for GLP-1 that are approaching the level of DPP-IVs among endocrinologists. This is an important lead indicator of the trends that we expect to see across the market.  We've also been able to identify spontaneous writing from primary care physicians we haven't targeted yet and who are already adopting BYDUREON in their practice, either from participating in a speaker program, peer recommendations or from their own interest in the molecule. Clearly, we are seeing a broadening of writers earlier in the launch than we anticipated. Feedback from health care professionals in this early launch also suggests strong patient acceptance of BYDUREON. As an example, our customers telling us that they are experiencing very few BYDUREON patients calling back to their offices with questions either on the use of the single-dose tray or the medicine itself. We are pleased to see the medical community is very supportive of BYDUREON and the value it can provide with patients with type 2 diabetes.  Our sampling program includes primarily live samples. These are specifically packaged in one single-dosing tray, which equates to one week of therapy. We began distributing these samples to physicians' offices in late February to support new patient starts. In many cases, these samples enabled patients to have their first dose of BYDUREON in the physician's office with the assistance of a health care professional. We believe this is a really good way to introduce BYDUREON to patients.  Additionally, we are providing vouchers to some physicians who do not have samples in their offices. These vouchers can be exchanged for a prescription of BYDUREON at the local pharmacy. Unlike samples, prescriptions filled using these coupons will be counted in prescription tallies, which will not be accounted for in revenue. We're also pleased that the growing rate of acceptance of mail order delivery. Already, 12% of our BYDUREON scripts are coming through mail order channels. Obviously, the value of an individual prescription will depend on the mixture of distribution to various channels.  Another very important element that we are addressing, as we launch BYDUREON as the third GLP-1 in the market, is managed care coverage. We're working with payor organizations to provide BYDUREON to as many patients as possible that can benefit from this novel therapy at the lowest branded copay. To support patients in the near term while we work to achieve this goal, we are utilizing tools such as a copaid card assistance program for patients that may initially have higher copays. The copay card program helps to ensure a low out-of-pocket cost for the patients in the interim.  We've had some early wins, several insurance plans and military facilities have made BYDUREON available to their beneficiaries. Over 50% of commercial lives are already covered without restrictions, some at the lowest out-of-pocket expense possible or as a preferred branded drug for diabetes. However, we recognize that this is a highly competitive environment and will require us to maintain our focus to gain broad access for BYDUREON as we have done for BYETTA. Now let's move on to BYETTA. BYETTA prescriptions decreased by 4.3% in line with our expectations. BYETTA script share will continue to be very dynamic, as some patients switch their GLP-1 therapies. Although BYETTA total prescriptions declined quarter-over-quarter in TRx, they'll continue to observe stabilization in new prescriptions throughout the first quarter. Early feedback from our field team indicates increasing usage of BYETTA as a mealtime GLP-1 with insulin glargine therapy.  Overall, we're pleased to see, not only an increase in the Exenatide total prescription share of the GLP-1 class, but also an increase in GLP-1 share of the branded type 2 diabetes market in the first quarter. Moving on to SYMLIN. SYMLIN prescriptions declined by 10%. This decrease is attributable to our focus on the U.S. BYDUREON launch and the restructuring of our field sales force. In the middle of the first quarter, we completed the hiring, training and launch of our new 65-person specialty sales team. We expect to continue to see some variability in prescription trends for SYMLIN while the new sales team gets familiar with their products, physician targets and routing. I'll close my portion of the remarks by saying that we are very pleased with the early performance of the BYDUREON launch in the U.S. and early indications of strong growth and adoption in the GLP-1 market as a proportion of the branded diabetes market. We are executing against our commercial launch plans for BYDUREON as well into continue to drive BYETTA and SYMLIN product sales.  Now I'll turn the call back over to Dan for a few additional comments. Daniel M. Bradbury Thanks, Vince. Before the close of our prepared remarks, I'll just add a few more comments. As we enter the second quarter of 2012, I would like to quickly preview our presence at 2 upcoming conferences. We will be at the American Diabetes Association Scientific Meeting that will be held June 8 through June 11 in Philadelphia. Once again, we are planning to have a significant scientific and commercial presence at that meeting. A preliminary list of our abstracts and other activities at ADA will be posted to our corporate website when available.  Additionally, the webcast of our annual investor reception at the ADA will take place on Sunday, June 10, at 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time. We look forward to seeing many of you in Philadelphia as we will review meeting highlights and take questions. In addition, we will be presenting data from our metreleptin program at the Endo 2012 annual meeting, June 23 to June 26 in Houston.  I'm also pleased to note that we'll be holding our 2012 annual meeting of stockholders on Tuesday, May 15 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time in San Diego. For those stockholders who are unable to attend the meeting in person, we invite you to listen to the webcasts of the meeting followed by a corporate overview. We look forward to this opportunity to provide additional updates about Amylin and meet with our stockholders in person. In closing, I'd like to reiterate that I, along with the Amylin board of directors and leadership team, remain committed to creating value for our shareholders, our employees and the millions of diabetes patients we're focused on serving. Additionally, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge and thank the employees of Amylin whose hard work and diligent efforts enabled several key achievements in the first quarter, including the approval and launch of BYDUREON and quickly bringing this revolutionary medicine to physicians and patients across the country. Before we turn to the Q&A, I want to address the recent rumors and market speculation regarding Amylin.  Amylin's Board of Directors is fully aware of its fiduciary duties and is committed to always acting in the best interest of stockholders. The board continually considers all options available and is relentlessly focused on creating the greatest value for our stockholders. Furthermore, we are pleased that Carlisle Kent has withdrawn his lawsuit seeking to extend the direct to nomination deadline for our upcoming annual meeting.  With that said, the purpose of today's call is to discuss first quarter results and we can ask you to limit your questions to these results. We will not be commenting further on recent market rumors or matters involving Carlisle Kent.  I will now turn the call over to the operator to open the lines for questions. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Alethia Young It's Alethia Young in for Robyn Karnauskas. Just a quick question on, just wanted to get some more color on how your ex-U.S. partner conversations are going? And just if you can give us a little bit more characterization on those? Daniel M. Bradbury Sure, thanks for the question, I appreciate it. They're going well. We continue to have high level of interest in an o U.S. partnership and remain confident that we will be able to get one in place going forward. Alethia Young Okay, great. And then just one quick other one. On the new patients versus switches, have you guys given the like kind of an exact breakout? I know you characterized a fair amount of new patients. Daniel M. Bradbury Yes, what I'm going to do is ask Vince to comment on that. Vince? Vincent P. Mihalik Yes. Thanks, Robyn, for the question -- sorry, not Robyn. But thank you for the question. We have said, from based on our internal data, that we're looking at it. We see that the majority of patients are coming from patients naive to GLP-1 therapy as opposed to products, which is, there's some dynamics, of course, as patients are switching between GLP-1 therapies. But the majority of BYDUREON scripts are coming from patients naive to GLP-1 therapy. Daniel M. Bradbury I think I'd refer you to Slide 7 in the deck that accompanied the webcast and what you can see there is the change in share in the GLP-1 market since the launch of BYDUREON in February. Operator Thomas Wei with Jefferies. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division I wanted to ask a little bit more on maybe these ex-U.S. partner negotiations that are underway right now. Can you just remind us, where are you exactly in terms of -- where was Lilly in obtaining reimbursement approval in France, Italy and Spain? And if they were in the process of that, when was that expected or when would that expected to be completed? Daniel M. Bradbury Hi Thomas, good morning. I'm going to ask Vince to get back to you on that one. Vincent P. Mihalik So Thomas, first, as Dan mentioned in his comments, we were approved in 35 countries, launched in 15. We have put in dossiers to the Italian, Spanish authorities for pricing and reimbursement. So those dossiers are underway. We haven't yet approached France, relative to a dossier for pricing in France. We'll probably do that with our o U.S. partner. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division And for Italy and Spain, when would that be expected to yield a decision? Vincent P. Mihalik Yes, I don't know, Thomas. Obviously, when you submit a dossier, it takes a period of time for them to review it. Given some of the issues going on in Europe, it may take longer than the usual process. We'll have to see. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division Can you say when those were put in? Vincent P. Mihalik Off the top of my head, I don't know, Thomas, but we could get you that information. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division I guess, part of the reason why I'm asking all of this is, I'm trying to get a sense of when you might actually be in a position to actually have pricing approval in some of these countries, yet not have a partner for launch. Is the goal to have a partnership signed so that you can smoothly transition from obtaining reimbursement approval to a product launch? Or does that not really matter, that you're happy to kind of wait and sit on an actual approved and reimbursed product without a partner for some period of time? Daniel M. Bradbury So, Thomas, that's a great question. And absolutely, one of the things we're trying to do is minimize disruption in the launch of BYDUREON and to ensure that we'll have the most effective launch. And obviously, one of the key things there is timing of partnership discussions with regards to also the planned reimbursement periods for new launches in various different countries. So absolutely, one of the things that we're working on there is how do you minimize disruption and maximize the effectiveness of launches. Operator Tom Russo with Baird. Thomas J. Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Dan, I know you can't comment on speculation, but maybe along the lines of Thomas' last question. Can we just get the company's latest thoughts on the importance of an o U.S. partnership sooner than later to optimize the launch versus the strategic value of keeping the asset totally unencumbered economically? Daniel M. Bradbury So I'll just comment on the first part of your question there. Because, otherwise, I think I'm providing comments that would be responding to speculation, which I said at the beginning of the call, I would not do. But with respect to the o U.S. partnership, clearly, it's important, going forward, to get that in place as soon as possible. We said that last year, at the time we announced the settlement agreement with Eli Lilly and Company. And so we are working towards that in a manner to ensure that we can make that happen as soon as possible and as efficiently as possible. Thomas J. Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Okay. And the second question on the launch itself in the U.S. Vince made comments about nonrevenue-generating scripts that would be showing up in third-party databases. And I know that the revenues that were reported only reflected initial stocking. So I guess I'm just curious, can you give us a sense of what proportion of RXs that have been seen so far are revenue-generating? Daniel M. Bradbury So, I guess, I'll just make a couple of comments now and hand over to Vince. So I think one of the most important statements in Mark's comments was that, what you're seeing in terms of the revenues for BYDUREON to had been reported for the first quarter, they literally represent just the initial stocking. And one of the things that we've been pleased to see has been, since the early part of the second quarter, we're now seeing repeat orders coming in from wholesalers and distributors on a regular basis and we're starting to see those shipments build as we've moved into the second quarter. So maybe I'll ask Vince to comment about his comment regarding prescriptions. Vincent P. Mihalik Yes, so specifically what I was commenting on is vouchers. And vouchers come through the system, obviously, they don't contribute to revenue initially until it turns into an NRx or a TRx at some point. So the key point here was that vouchers actually go through the system but don't add to revenue, that's a very, very small proportion of our overall, I'll say, NRxs that are going through the system at any point in time. I don't want to give you a ratio for competitive reasons. But let's say, the vast majority of what we do is samples versus vouchers. Mark G. Foletta And Tom this is Mark. The only thing -- Tom, I'm sorry, it's Mark. The only thing I'll add is, of course, that is accounted for when we, in our gross and net adjustments. So the net number that you see reflects what is truly the new revenue-generating scripts, if you will. Operator Karen Jay with JMPC. Karen E. Jay - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division This is Karen Jay in for Cory Kasimov at JPMorgan. I'm just wondering if you could give us a sense of early feedback from Europe and the interest level or reception to BYDUREON in endocrinology practices versus CVD? Daniel M. Bradbury Yes, sure, Karen. Thanks very much for the question, I appreciate it. So firstly, I'd say, we're actually feeling very good about the feedback that we're getting from the field force but also, most importantly, from physicians. One of the things that we found is that firstly, the training that we gave our reps at the time of the launch has been very effective, that their ability to initiate BYDUREON has been very well executed. And as a result of that, and as a result of the improved tolerability, that we've seen with BYDUREON in the clinical trials, that's now manifesting, those 2 things, the training, the enablement of the initiation of therapy and improved tolerability. The way that, that's feeding back to us, is actually, literally, when we go out, when we visit with physicians, what they say is, I literally get no call backs. And that's actually very good news going forward, because that means sustainability with respect to patients staying on the product going forward is likely to be improved relative to the introduction of other GLP-1 receptor agonists. And maybe in terms of endocrinologists versus primary care physicians, again, one of the things I'll do is maybe refer you to Slide 8 in the deck that accompanied the webcast this morning, and Slide 9. One of the things that we're very pleased to see in terms of -- if you look at Slide 9, what you'll see is that the growth in the GLP-1 class has been 18% in just a few weeks since BYDUREON has launched. And what you're seeing is a very big swing towards GLP-1s in those physicians that we targeted at launch. And so as we roll out the launch further and expand the scope of the physician base that we target, we expect to see that growth continue across a wider range of physicians. I don't know, Vince, whether you want to add any additional comments. Vincent P. Mihalik I just want to clarify one point that, Karen, were you asking also about Europe or just about the U.S.? Karen E. Jay - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division I mean, both would be great. Vincent P. Mihalik Yes. Actually, Dan's comments relative to the U.S. about no callbacks are also true for Europe. We're hearing from our Lilly colleagues that physicians in Europe are also not seeing as many callbacks on BYDUREON as they do other GLP-1s. And as a result, we're seeing, I think the whole GLP-1 class, for instance, in Germany. Above 30% in new patient starts are going to BYDUREON and relative to the U.K., although we didn't get final mice published for the late February, beginning of March. Already about approximately 100 of the 180 public trusts have already added BYDUREON and we're seeing very nice growth. And based on therapy, the GLP-1 class is up to about 25% of our prior year, even in the U.K. So I think we're seeing very nice growth and adoption in Europe and as Dan already commented on our launch here in the United States, we were very focused on hyper frequency on those high-decile, highly-influential endocrinologists, as well as primary care physicians that can influence other primary care physicians, and we're seeing very nice growth in adoption and productivity in that group. Operator Mark Schoenebaum with ISI group. Unknown Analyst This is [indiscernible] sitting in for Mark. I wanted to touch a little bit more on partnership negotiations. In light of rumors, I guess, just sort of understanding the partnership negotiations from the perspective of how partnership versus sale, how one might make that decision and whether those might be mutually exclusive. Daniel M. Bradbury So I'll just go back to the comments that I made at the end of the call and that is to say that we are continually considering all options available. And obviously, we're focused on creating the greatest value for our stockholders. We are continuing o U.S. partnering negotiations, and those negotiations are going well. And I think it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the specifics of those negotiations until such negotiations are concluded. Operator Yaron Werber with Citi. Christopher Mortko This is Chris sitting in for Yaron. Could you give us a little bit more color about what type of docs are using BYDUREON, general practitioners versus endocrinologists? And is most of the use in previous GLP-1 writers or new docs? Daniel M. Bradbury Thanks for the question, Chris. I'm going to ask Vince to comment on that. But just to say that one of the things that is very important about our launch was that, as I think Vince said in response to an earlier question, we were very targeted in the initial part of our launch and we'll continue to be for a while yet, until we expand out. And Vince, maybe you want to add color to that? Vincent P. Mihalik Yes. First of all, Chris, thanks for the question. And yes, the doctors were seeing writing are both of endocrinologists and primary care physicians. In fact, on a prescriber number basis, there are more primary care physicians writing BYDUREON than endocrinologists as, of course, you would expect the endocrinologists write more scripts. But we're also seeing a lot of spontaneous writers as well. In fact, as we look through our target list, we see doctors coming up pretty regularly who we have not yet called on. They may be on our target list, but we haven't yet called on them and/or they're not even in our launch model of the 51,000 we targeted who are writing BYDUREON either from peer recommendation, having attended a program or simply their interest in the molecule. So we're seeing a lot of usage in primary care even at this early stage, although as Dan commented, we were focused on hyper frequency on those high decile, highly-influential writers this early in the launch. Operator Nicholas Bishop with Cowen & Company. Nicholas Bishop - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division I had a question, actually, around general patterns of distributor stocking. And the reason I'm curious is that with the launch of the last GLP-1 product in early 2010, we saw very substantial distributor stocking in the first quarter of launch and then very little in the next quarter as a result of a bit heavy inventory build. So has that patterned among distributors? Is that different for BYDUREON? What kind of inventory carry should we expect and would there be any unusual dynamics as a result in the next quarter? Daniel M. Bradbury Thanks, Nicholas. Yes, I'm going to ask Vince to initially comment and also Mark to comment on that with respect to financial results. Vincent P. Mihalik Hi Nicholas, so obviously there are various ways you can launch a drug into the marketplace. You can provide incentives to distributors for them to stock up and then it becomes a push strategy. Or the other way you can do it is to give them an initial stocking level and then based on demand, they'd do a pull strategy. We actually followed the pull strategy. And as you know, distributors look at demand, they calculate based on their demand, what the safety stock they would be based on that demand, an economic order quantity that makes sense for them, and then they actually issue orders based on that. What we wanted to do is to have a consistent revenue from the launch of BYDUREON. We didn't want to have the situation where we had a spectacular quarter and then a week or next quarter. So our whole strategy was the pull strategy as we went into the launch of BYDUREON. Which is why you can see each week, the revenue from shipments continue to increase, it gives us the opportunity to see what demand actually is rather than following a push strategy. Mark G. Foletta And the only thing I'll add to that Nicholas, is that in the prepared comments, we did say that we saw reorders commence very early in the second quarter in the month of the April. In fact, we've seen 4 consecutive weeks now of accelerating orders. So I think that, that signaled it. And I put it in the prepared remarks, that we do expect sequential increase in BYDUREON from the first quarter to the second quarter. Operator Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Just was -- first, wondering if you can give us any insight into the 1Q SG&A expense? Was wondering if there were any one-time launch expenses or if that's a reasonable run rate to assume for the rest of the year? Daniel M. Bradbury Hi, Terence. Yes, I'm going to ask Mark to get back to you on that one. Mark G. Foletta Yes, Terence, thanks for the question. Clearly, the first quarter did include one-time launch expenses. I think it's fair to say, those will continue into the second quarter, just given where we are in the launch. In the prepared remarks, we did say that our combined operating expenses of $161 million for the first quarter, that's combined SG&A and R&D expenses, were above -- that run rate is above the guidance for the year. So the way you should think about that is that in the second half of the year, those expenses will drop off and we continue to believe that it will be in the $600 million to $625 million range of GAAP operating expenses. So the types of costs that those would include, of course, would be the training of the sales force, the launch meetings and then the frontloading of your spend on the marketing. Operator Mike King with Rodman & Renshaw. Michael G. King - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, Research Division I have 2 related very strategic questions about BYDUREON. Number one, by our view of the scripts, the launch is trailing that of Victoza. So I just would love your views on how we should think about that. And number two, I also wanted to have you address the issue of your competitors in the GLP-1 space having in-house insulin products that could combine with their proprietary GLP-1s and as far as I know, Amylin doesn't have any access to anything like that. So do you feel you have any competitive disadvantage relative to Sanofi and Novo on that respect? Daniel M. Bradbury So, Mike, thanks for the questions. Vince, you want to comment with regards to the launch? Vincent P. Mihalik Yes. Mike, thanks for the question. First and foremost, looking at comparators to BYDUREON in the launch, the comparisons you made were to BYETTA and to Victoza. And I would first say that taking a drug that launched 5 years ago or even a drug as simple as 2 years ago and making the comparison here is difficult given the changes in health care reform competition, and I would say, even reimbursement and access in today's marketplace. Also I would like to make a comment, we are the third GLP-1 into the market. You would also expect that, that would have some impact on the uptake curve. Having said all of that, actually, we're very pleased with where we are, the week-on-week difference is actually quite small in TRxs, and our focus has been on those endocrinologists to build a very solid base. We know that endocrinologists and these primary care, we call them endo-mimetics, doctors who prescribe a lot of diabetes drugs are the ones that you really want to get. As I've talked about in the past, the sweet spot in this market is roughly about 50,000 to 70,000 doctors, although the number of doctors writing insulin, for instance, is well over 300,000. We know that the vast majority of scripts are written by a handful of doctors. It's a very concentrated market and that has been our focus, to build our volume and our acceptability and more importantly, our productivity in that base. As it relates to having in-house insulins and whether that's going to matter for GLP-1s, I would simply say that the marketplace has yet to speak to that. Because quite frankly, if you look at the insulin business, premixes do not do well. Doctors like to have the availability to vary dosage for different drugs as opposed to having fixed combinations. So I'm not necessarily convinced yet based on what we see in market research that not having an insulin franchise will be critical to the acceptance of a GLP-1 on a standalone basis. Daniel M. Bradbury I guess, I'd add to that, Mike, is at this point, it's kind of too early to comment on these potential products going forward relative to our portfolio. Firstly, there is no data yet available on the profile of what these products will look like in late-stage studies. And I think, there's a question about what's really going to be the value, as Vince talked about, of premixing going forward versus dosing individually. One comment I would also make is that if you look at the Exenatide franchise and our plans for the franchise going forward, one of the things that we're doing is that we're increasing the convenience of the use of Exenatide going forward with our future product, planned product launches. The BYDUREON 10, as you know, will be available at the end of this year, beginning of next year. We're also commencing our work on the weekly suspension. The Phase III program will start the middle of this year for that. And the monthly suspension program, talk about a massive increase in convenience to patients going forward will be starting Phase III in the beginning of next year. So I think it's fair to say that we feel very confident about the competitive profile of the Exenatide franchise relative to potential future competition coming forward. Operator Our final question comes from David Friedman with Morgan Stanley. David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Just in terms of the growth dynamics, you have talked about and you quoted sort of a mid-to-high double -- or a mid-to-high teens growth for GLP sequentially pre-imposed launch of BYDUREON. But it seems like Exenatide has been relatively flat with most of the growth going to Victoza. So I guess I'm wondering, how do you expect to shift the growth to Exenatide and does this involve needing to take share specifically from Victoza? Daniel M. Bradbury So, David, thanks for the questions. I guess a couple of comments. First and foremost, we've seen pretty dramatic increase in terms of the size of the GLP-1 market since the launch of BYDUREON. And I refer you to Slide 8 in the pack that we have -- sorry, Slide 6 in the pack that we have that comes with the webcast. Also, if you look at Slide 7, what you'll see is the increasing share of new prescriptions, which will of course predict future TRxs that we've seen since the launch of BYDUREON. And an important comment I'd make there is that you see that from the time of the launch of BYDUREON to date, which is less than 10 weeks, you'll see a 3.6% increase in market share of NRxs, so that BYDUREON -- sorry, Exenatide to move from 41.9% to 45.5% of the GLP-1 class, which has grown over that period as well. So it's not just the fact that we are increasing share, it's that actually the whole market is growing. The other thing I'd point to when you commented about our double-digit growth, I think you were referring to a comment I made earlier with regards to growth in the physicians that we've spent the most time targeting since the launch of BYDUREON, and that's endocrinologists. And if you look at Slide 9 in the pack, what you'll see is that the GLP-1 class has grown from 14.3% to 16.9% of the branded type new diabetes prescriptions. And that's an 18% growth since the launch of BYDUREON. And the thing that's most important about that is, that's in the group of physicians that we've been really targeting since the launch of BYDUREON. But even if you look at primary care, you're seeing an 8% growth in the class since the time of the launch of BYDUREON as well. So, as Vince said earlier, we continue to be very pleased about the launch. Specifically, because we know exactly where we're putting our promotional effort at the moment and we're seeing very good response in terms of increased physician productivity and the physicians that we're targeting. So as we change that going forward, we can predict to see a greater growth across the entire physician population. David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Great. And just one last question. Can you comment on the comparative profitability of a BYETTA patient versus a BYDUREON patient given the price differential, as well as the cost of goods differential? Daniel M. Bradbury Sure. So I guess, there's a couple of components to that. Well, certainly, as you've seen, BYDUREON is priced higher than BYETTA. But that having been said, because BYETTA has been in the market for a while now, we have extremely low cost of goods associated with BYETTA. And so we're seeing margins in the 90s on BYETTA. As Mark has guided previously, we don't expect to be getting close to the optimum margins for BYDUREON for some time. And as a result of the fact that BYDUREON is a somewhat more complicated product and also there is a royalty payable to Alkermies on BYDUREON, we don't expect longer term to be seeing such high-level margins on BYDUREON going forward. That having been said, we do -- BYDUREON will be a very profitable product for us over the long term. Mark G. Foletta One additional data point on your GLP-1 dynamics, Dave, that I'll comment on, this is Mark Foletta, is that BYETTA scripts sequentially, was in the prepared remarks, were down just over 4%. I mean, that's actually fairly consistent with the erosion that you saw before BYDUREON came to the market. So that's it. Now, there's another data point and actually the NRxs, were up modestly from Q4 to Q1 that is well, which is really the first time we saw that for a number of quarters. Daniel M. Bradbury Thank you very much, David. Okay. I think that's all the questions to today. And, again, I'd like to thank you for your interest and your questions. We have a huge opportunity to continue to advance our mission of discovering, developing and commercializing medicines to improve the lives of patients with diabetes. Additionally, I'd like to reiterate that our leadership team and the many dedicated employees of Amylin remain focused on building the business today and laying the necessary foundation for success tomorrow.

Just a quick question on, just wanted to get some more color on how your ex-U.S. partner conversations are going? And just if you can give us a little bit more characterization on those? Daniel M. Bradbury Sure, thanks for the question, I appreciate it. They're going well. We continue to have high level of interest in an o U.S. partnership and remain confident that we will be able to get one in place going forward. Alethia Young Okay, great. And then just one quick other one. On the new patients versus switches, have you guys given the like kind of an exact breakout? I know you characterized a fair amount of new patients. Daniel M. Bradbury Yes, what I'm going to do is ask Vince to comment on that. Vince? Vincent P. Mihalik Yes. Thanks, Robyn, for the question -- sorry, not Robyn. But thank you for the question. We have said, from based on our internal data, that we're looking at it. We see that the majority of patients are coming from patients naive to GLP-1 therapy as opposed to products, which is, there's some dynamics, of course, as patients are switching between GLP-1 therapies. But the majority of BYDUREON scripts are coming from patients naive to GLP-1 therapy. Daniel M. Bradbury I think I'd refer you to Slide 7 in the deck that accompanied the webcast and what you can see there is the change in share in the GLP-1 market since the launch of BYDUREON in February. Operator Thomas Wei with Jefferies. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division I wanted to ask a little bit more on maybe these ex-U.S. partner negotiations that are underway right now. Can you just remind us, where are you exactly in terms of -- where was Lilly in obtaining reimbursement approval in France, Italy and Spain? And if they were in the process of that, when was that expected or when would that expected to be completed? Daniel M. Bradbury Hi Thomas, good morning. I'm going to ask Vince to get back to you on that one. Vincent P. Mihalik So Thomas, first, as Dan mentioned in his comments, we were approved in 35 countries, launched in 15. We have put in dossiers to the Italian, Spanish authorities for pricing and reimbursement. So those dossiers are underway. We haven't yet approached France, relative to a dossier for pricing in France. We'll probably do that with our o U.S. partner. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division And for Italy and Spain, when would that be expected to yield a decision? Vincent P. Mihalik Yes, I don't know, Thomas. Obviously, when you submit a dossier, it takes a period of time for them to review it. Given some of the issues going on in Europe, it may take longer than the usual process. We'll have to see. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division Can you say when those were put in? Vincent P. Mihalik Off the top of my head, I don't know, Thomas, but we could get you that information. Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division I guess, part of the reason why I'm asking all of this is, I'm trying to get a sense of when you might actually be in a position to actually have pricing approval in some of these countries, yet not have a partner for launch. Is the goal to have a partnership signed so that you can smoothly transition from obtaining reimbursement approval to a product launch? Or does that not really matter, that you're happy to kind of wait and sit on an actual approved and reimbursed product without a partner for some period of time? Daniel M. Bradbury So, Thomas, that's a great question. And absolutely, one of the things we're trying to do is minimize disruption in the launch of BYDUREON and to ensure that we'll have the most effective launch. And obviously, one of the key things there is timing of partnership discussions with regards to also the planned reimbursement periods for new launches in various different countries. So absolutely, one of the things that we're working on there is how do you minimize disruption and maximize the effectiveness of launches. Operator Tom Russo with Baird. Thomas J. Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Dan, I know you can't comment on speculation, but maybe along the lines of Thomas' last question. Can we just get the company's latest thoughts on the importance of an o U.S. partnership sooner than later to optimize the launch versus the strategic value of keeping the asset totally unencumbered economically? Daniel M. Bradbury So I'll just comment on the first part of your question there. Because, otherwise, I think I'm providing comments that would be responding to speculation, which I said at the beginning of the call, I would not do. But with respect to the o U.S. partnership, clearly, it's important, going forward, to get that in place as soon as possible. We said that last year, at the time we announced the settlement agreement with Eli Lilly and Company. And so we are working towards that in a manner to ensure that we can make that happen as soon as possible and as efficiently as possible. Thomas J. Russo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Okay. And the second question on the launch itself in the U.S. Vince made comments about nonrevenue-generating scripts that would be showing up in third-party databases. And I know that the revenues that were reported only reflected initial stocking. So I guess I'm just curious, can you give us a sense of what proportion of RXs that have been seen so far are revenue-generating? Daniel M. Bradbury So, I guess, I'll just make a couple of comments now and hand over to Vince. So I think one of the most important statements in Mark's comments was that, what you're seeing in terms of the revenues for BYDUREON to had been reported for the first quarter, they literally represent just the initial stocking. And one of the things that we've been pleased to see has been, since the early part of the second quarter, we're now seeing repeat orders coming in from wholesalers and distributors on a regular basis and we're starting to see those shipments build as we've moved into the second quarter. So maybe I'll ask Vince to comment about his comment regarding prescriptions. Vincent P. Mihalik Yes, so specifically what I was commenting on is vouchers. And vouchers come through the system, obviously, they don't contribute to revenue initially until it turns into an NRx or a TRx at some point. So the key point here was that vouchers actually go through the system but don't add to revenue, that's a very, very small proportion of our overall, I'll say, NRxs that are going through the system at any point in time. I don't want to give you a ratio for competitive reasons. But let's say, the vast majority of what we do is samples versus vouchers. Mark G. Foletta And Tom this is Mark. The only thing -- Tom, I'm sorry, it's Mark. The only thing I'll add is, of course, that is accounted for when we, in our gross and net adjustments. So the net number that you see reflects what is truly the new revenue-generating scripts, if you will. Operator Karen Jay with JMPC. Karen E. Jay - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division This is Karen Jay in for Cory Kasimov at JPMorgan. I'm just wondering if you could give us a sense of early feedback from Europe and the interest level or reception to BYDUREON in endocrinology practices versus CVD? Daniel M. Bradbury Yes, sure, Karen. Thanks very much for the question, I appreciate it. So firstly, I'd say, we're actually feeling very good about the feedback that we're getting from the field force but also, most importantly, from physicians. One of the things that we found is that firstly, the training that we gave our reps at the time of the launch has been very effective, that their ability to initiate BYDUREON has been very well executed. And as a result of that, and as a result of the improved tolerability, that we've seen with BYDUREON in the clinical trials, that's now manifesting, those 2 things, the training, the enablement of the initiation of therapy and improved tolerability. The way that, that's feeding back to us, is actually, literally, when we go out, when we visit with physicians, what they say is, I literally get no call backs. And that's actually very good news going forward, because that means sustainability with respect to patients staying on the product going forward is likely to be improved relative to the introduction of other GLP-1 receptor agonists. And maybe in terms of endocrinologists versus primary care physicians, again, one of the things I'll do is maybe refer you to Slide 8 in the deck that accompanied the webcast this morning, and Slide 9. One of the things that we're very pleased to see in terms of -- if you look at Slide 9, what you'll see is that the growth in the GLP-1 class has been 18% in just a few weeks since BYDUREON has launched. And what you're seeing is a very big swing towards GLP-1s in those physicians that we targeted at launch. And so as we roll out the launch further and expand the scope of the physician base that we target, we expect to see that growth continue across a wider range of physicians. I don't know, Vince, whether you want to add any additional comments. Vincent P. Mihalik I just want to clarify one point that, Karen, were you asking also about Europe or just about the U.S.? Karen E. Jay - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division I mean, both would be great. Vincent P. Mihalik Yes. Actually, Dan's comments relative to the U.S. about no callbacks are also true for Europe. We're hearing from our Lilly colleagues that physicians in Europe are also not seeing as many callbacks on BYDUREON as they do other GLP-1s. And as a result, we're seeing, I think the whole GLP-1 class, for instance, in Germany. Above 30% in new patient starts are going to BYDUREON and relative to the U.K., although we didn't get final mice published for the late February, beginning of March. Already about approximately 100 of the 180 public trusts have already added BYDUREON and we're seeing very nice growth. And based on therapy, the GLP-1 class is up to about 25% of our prior year, even in the U.K. So I think we're seeing very nice growth and adoption in Europe and as Dan already commented on our launch here in the United States, we were very focused on hyper frequency on those high-decile, highly-influential endocrinologists, as well as primary care physicians that can influence other primary care physicians, and we're seeing very nice growth in adoption and productivity in that group. Operator Mark Schoenebaum with ISI group. Unknown Analyst This is [indiscernible] sitting in for Mark. I wanted to touch a little bit more on partnership negotiations. In light of rumors, I guess, just sort of understanding the partnership negotiations from the perspective of how partnership versus sale, how one might make that decision and whether those might be mutually exclusive. Daniel M. Bradbury So I'll just go back to the comments that I made at the end of the call and that is to say that we are continually considering all options available. And obviously, we're focused on creating the greatest value for our stockholders. We are continuing o U.S. partnering negotiations, and those negotiations are going well. And I think it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the specifics of those negotiations until such negotiations are concluded. Operator Yaron Werber with Citi. Christopher Mortko This is Chris sitting in for Yaron. Could you give us a little bit more color about what type of docs are using BYDUREON, general practitioners versus endocrinologists? And is most of the use in previous GLP-1 writers or new docs? Daniel M. Bradbury Thanks for the question, Chris. I'm going to ask Vince to comment on that. But just to say that one of the things that is very important about our launch was that, as I think Vince said in response to an earlier question, we were very targeted in the initial part of our launch and we'll continue to be for a while yet, until we expand out. And Vince, maybe you want to add color to that? Vincent P. Mihalik Yes. First of all, Chris, thanks for the question. And yes, the doctors were seeing writing are both of endocrinologists and primary care physicians. In fact, on a prescriber number basis, there are more primary care physicians writing BYDUREON than endocrinologists as, of course, you would expect the endocrinologists write more scripts. But we're also seeing a lot of spontaneous writers as well. In fact, as we look through our target list, we see doctors coming up pretty regularly who we have not yet called on. They may be on our target list, but we haven't yet called on them and/or they're not even in our launch model of the 51,000 we targeted who are writing BYDUREON either from peer recommendation, having attended a program or simply their interest in the molecule. So we're seeing a lot of usage in primary care even at this early stage, although as Dan commented, we were focused on hyper frequency on those high decile, highly-influential writers this early in the launch. Operator Nicholas Bishop with Cowen & Company. Nicholas Bishop - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division I had a question, actually, around general patterns of distributor stocking. And the reason I'm curious is that with the launch of the last GLP-1 product in early 2010, we saw very substantial distributor stocking in the first quarter of launch and then very little in the next quarter as a result of a bit heavy inventory build. So has that patterned among distributors? Is that different for BYDUREON? What kind of inventory carry should we expect and would there be any unusual dynamics as a result in the next quarter? Daniel M. Bradbury Thanks, Nicholas. Yes, I'm going to ask Vince to initially comment and also Mark to comment on that with respect to financial results. Vincent P. Mihalik Hi Nicholas, so obviously there are various ways you can launch a drug into the marketplace. You can provide incentives to distributors for them to stock up and then it becomes a push strategy. Or the other way you can do it is to give them an initial stocking level and then based on demand, they'd do a pull strategy. We actually followed the pull strategy. And as you know, distributors look at demand, they calculate based on their demand, what the safety stock they would be based on that demand, an economic order quantity that makes sense for them, and then they actually issue orders based on that. What we wanted to do is to have a consistent revenue from the launch of BYDUREON. We didn't want to have the situation where we had a spectacular quarter and then a week or next quarter. So our whole strategy was the pull strategy as we went into the launch of BYDUREON. Which is why you can see each week, the revenue from shipments continue to increase, it gives us the opportunity to see what demand actually is rather than following a push strategy. Mark G. Foletta And the only thing I'll add to that Nicholas, is that in the prepared comments, we did say that we saw reorders commence very early in the second quarter in the month of the April. In fact, we've seen 4 consecutive weeks now of accelerating orders. So I think that, that signaled it. And I put it in the prepared remarks, that we do expect sequential increase in BYDUREON from the first quarter to the second quarter. Operator Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Just was -- first, wondering if you can give us any insight into the 1Q SG&A expense? Was wondering if there were any one-time launch expenses or if that's a reasonable run rate to assume for the rest of the year? Daniel M. Bradbury Hi, Terence. Yes, I'm going to ask Mark to get back to you on that one. Mark G. Foletta Yes, Terence, thanks for the question. Clearly, the first quarter did include one-time launch expenses. I think it's fair to say, those will continue into the second quarter, just given where we are in the launch. In the prepared remarks, we did say that our combined operating expenses of $161 million for the first quarter, that's combined SG&A and R&D expenses, were above -- that run rate is above the guidance for the year. So the way you should think about that is that in the second half of the year, those expenses will drop off and we continue to believe that it will be in the $600 million to $625 million range of GAAP operating expenses. So the types of costs that those would include, of course, would be the training of the sales force, the launch meetings and then the frontloading of your spend on the marketing. Operator Mike King with Rodman & Renshaw. Michael G. King - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, Research Division I have 2 related very strategic questions about BYDUREON. Number one, by our view of the scripts, the launch is trailing that of Victoza. So I just would love your views on how we should think about that. And number two, I also wanted to have you address the issue of your competitors in the GLP-1 space having in-house insulin products that could combine with their proprietary GLP-1s and as far as I know, Amylin doesn't have any access to anything like that. So do you feel you have any competitive disadvantage relative to Sanofi and Novo on that respect? Daniel M. Bradbury So, Mike, thanks for the questions. Vince, you want to comment with regards to the launch? Vincent P. Mihalik Yes. Mike, thanks for the question. First and foremost, looking at comparators to BYDUREON in the launch, the comparisons you made were to BYETTA and to Victoza. And I would first say that taking a drug that launched 5 years ago or even a drug as simple as 2 years ago and making the comparison here is difficult given the changes in health care reform competition, and I would say, even reimbursement and access in today's marketplace. Also I would like to make a comment, we are the third GLP-1 into the market. You would also expect that, that would have some impact on the uptake curve. Having said all of that, actually, we're very pleased with where we are, the week-on-week difference is actually quite small in TRxs, and our focus has been on those endocrinologists to build a very solid base. We know that endocrinologists and these primary care, we call them endo-mimetics, doctors who prescribe a lot of diabetes drugs are the ones that you really want to get. As I've talked about in the past, the sweet spot in this market is roughly about 50,000 to 70,000 doctors, although the number of doctors writing insulin, for instance, is well over 300,000. We know that the vast majority of scripts are written by a handful of doctors. It's a very concentrated market and that has been our focus, to build our volume and our acceptability and more importantly, our productivity in that base. As it relates to having in-house insulins and whether that's going to matter for GLP-1s, I would simply say that the marketplace has yet to speak to that. Because quite frankly, if you look at the insulin business, premixes do not do well. Doctors like to have the availability to vary dosage for different drugs as opposed to having fixed combinations. So I'm not necessarily convinced yet based on what we see in market research that not having an insulin franchise will be critical to the acceptance of a GLP-1 on a standalone basis. Daniel M. Bradbury I guess, I'd add to that, Mike, is at this point, it's kind of too early to comment on these potential products going forward relative to our portfolio. Firstly, there is no data yet available on the profile of what these products will look like in late-stage studies. And I think, there's a question about what's really going to be the value, as Vince talked about, of premixing going forward versus dosing individually. One comment I would also make is that if you look at the Exenatide franchise and our plans for the franchise going forward, one of the things that we're doing is that we're increasing the convenience of the use of Exenatide going forward with our future product, planned product launches. The BYDUREON 10, as you know, will be available at the end of this year, beginning of next year. We're also commencing our work on the weekly suspension. The Phase III program will start the middle of this year for that. And the monthly suspension program, talk about a massive increase in convenience to patients going forward will be starting Phase III in the beginning of next year. So I think it's fair to say that we feel very confident about the competitive profile of the Exenatide franchise relative to potential future competition coming forward. Operator Our final question comes from David Friedman with Morgan Stanley. David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Just in terms of the growth dynamics, you have talked about and you quoted sort of a mid-to-high double -- or a mid-to-high teens growth for GLP sequentially pre-imposed launch of BYDUREON. But it seems like Exenatide has been relatively flat with most of the growth going to Victoza. So I guess I'm wondering, how do you expect to shift the growth to Exenatide and does this involve needing to take share specifically from Victoza? Daniel M. Bradbury So, David, thanks for the questions. I guess a couple of comments. First and foremost, we've seen pretty dramatic increase in terms of the size of the GLP-1 market since the launch of BYDUREON. And I refer you to Slide 8 in the pack that we have -- sorry, Slide 6 in the pack that we have that comes with the webcast. Also, if you look at Slide 7, what you'll see is the increasing share of new prescriptions, which will of course predict future TRxs that we've seen since the launch of BYDUREON. And an important comment I'd make there is that you see that from the time of the launch of BYDUREON to date, which is less than 10 weeks, you'll see a 3.6% increase in market share of NRxs, so that BYDUREON -- sorry, Exenatide to move from 41.9% to 45.5% of the GLP-1 class, which has grown over that period as well. So it's not just the fact that we are increasing share, it's that actually the whole market is growing. The other thing I'd point to when you commented about our double-digit growth, I think you were referring to a comment I made earlier with regards to growth in the physicians that we've spent the most time targeting since the launch of BYDUREON, and that's endocrinologists. And if you look at Slide 9 in the pack, what you'll see is that the GLP-1 class has grown from 14.3% to 16.9% of the branded type new diabetes prescriptions. And that's an 18% growth since the launch of BYDUREON. And the thing that's most important about that is, that's in the group of physicians that we've been really targeting since the launch of BYDUREON. But even if you look at primary care, you're seeing an 8% growth in the class since the time of the launch of BYDUREON as well. So, as Vince said earlier, we continue to be very pleased about the launch. Specifically, because we know exactly where we're putting our promotional effort at the moment and we're seeing very good response in terms of increased physician productivity and the physicians that we're targeting. So as we change that going forward, we can predict to see a greater growth across the entire physician population. David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Great. And just one last question. Can you comment on the comparative profitability of a BYETTA patient versus a BYDUREON patient given the price differential, as well as the cost of goods differential? Daniel M. Bradbury Sure. So I guess, there's a couple of components to that. Well, certainly, as you've seen, BYDUREON is priced higher than BYETTA. But that having been said, because BYETTA has been in the market for a while now, we have extremely low cost of goods associated with BYETTA. And so we're seeing margins in the 90s on BYETTA. As Mark has guided previously, we don't expect to be getting close to the optimum margins for BYDUREON for some time. And as a result of the fact that BYDUREON is a somewhat more complicated product and also there is a royalty payable to Alkermies on BYDUREON, we don't expect longer term to be seeing such high-level margins on BYDUREON going forward. That having been said, we do -- BYDUREON will be a very profitable product for us over the long term. Mark G. Foletta One additional data point on your GLP-1 dynamics, Dave, that I'll comment on, this is Mark Foletta, is that BYETTA scripts sequentially, was in the prepared remarks, were down just over 4%. I mean, that's actually fairly consistent with the erosion that you saw before BYDUREON came to the market. So that's it. Now, there's another data point and actually the NRxs, were up modestly from Q4 to Q1 that is well, which is really the first time we saw that for a number of quarters. Daniel M. Bradbury Thank you very much, David. Okay. I think that's all the questions to today. And, again, I'd like to thank you for your interest and your questions. We have a huge opportunity to continue to advance our mission of discovering, developing and commercializing medicines to improve the lives of patients with diabetes. Additionally, I'd like to reiterate that our leadership team and the many dedicated employees of Amylin remain focused on building the business today and laying the necessary foundation for success tomorrow.

Todays conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] And now, I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens. Please go ahead, sir. Dan Cravens Thanks, Ashley and good morning, everyone and welcome to the American Airlines Group second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. On the call with us this morning is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Scott Kirby, our President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room for the question-and-answer session is Robert Isom, our Chief Operating Officer; Bev Goulet, our Chief Integration Officer; and Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer as well as Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs. As is our normal practice, we are going to start the call today with Doug and he will provide an overview of our second quarter financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Scott will then follow with commentary on the revenue environment and our operational performance. And then after we hear from these comments, we will open the call for analysts Q&A and lastly, questions from the media. Before we begin, we must state that todays call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and cost, forecasts of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found on our website. A webcast of this call also will be archived on the website and the information that we are giving you on the call is as of todays date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So thanks, again for joining us this morning. And at this point, I will turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker. Doug Parker Thank you, Dan. Thanks everybody for being on. Happy to report our earnings today, $1.6 billion pre-tax earnings, excluding special charges, thats the second best in our companys history. Its worst over the last year, which was the best. Last year, we made $1.9 billion on similar terms. I am not particularly happy about that, but that is revenue driven. Scott will talk more about that and the trends there. On an EPS basis though, adjusted EPS, adjusted to the fact that we are booking taxes this year and didnt last year. You will see that our earnings were actually  EPS, adjusted EPS was actually up 7% even though the pre-tax earnings were down and thats due to our share repurchase activity, which Derek will talk more about. So, all-in-all, really great results for the team. They are the result of great work by a phenomenal team. We got 100,000 hardworking people in American Airlines. They are out there doing an amazing job of taking care of our customers and we are extremely appreciative. So with that said, I will turn it over to Derek and then Scott to give you some more details. Derek Kerr Alright. Thanks, Doug and good morning everybody. As is our normal process, we did file our 10-Q and earnings press release this morning. And in that release, our second quarter 2016 GAAP net profit was $950 million or $1.68 per diluted share. This compares to our 2015 GAAP net profit of $1.7 billion or $2.41 per diluted share. Excluding special charges, we reported a net profit of $1 billion or $1.77 per diluted share versus the second quarter of 2015 net profit of $1.9 billion or $2.62 per diluted share. As we talked about on our last two earnings calls, the company did reversed the val allowance on its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015. As a result, in 2016, the company is recognizing a provision for income tax that is substantially non-cash due to its utilization of NOLs. On a year-over-year basis, quarterly net profit in 2016 will not be comparable to net profit in 2015. Accordingly, we believe pre-tax profit and pre-tax profit excluding net special items is a better measure for evaluating year-over-year performance than net income. On that basis, our second quarter net tax or pre-tax profit was $1.5 billion, equating to a pre-tax margin of 14.4% on a GAAP basis. Excluding special charges, our pre-tax profit was $1.6 billion, which resulted in a pre-tax margin of 15.4%. And as Doug said, both of these measures are the second best, second quarter pre-tax margin in company history. Excluding the effect of special items and the non-cash tax provision of $541 million, our second quarter 2016 adjusted fully diluted EPS was $2.81 per share, up 7.3% as compared to second quarter 2015, reflecting a 20% reduction in our fully diluted average share count. Total capacity for the second quarter of 2016 was 70.8 billion ASMs, up 1.9% from the second quarter with mainline up 1.2% and regional capacity up 8%. Our second quarter 2016 revenue is impacted by a competitive capacity growth, continued global macroeconomic softness and foreign currency weakness. For the quarter, total operating revenues were $10.4 billion, down 4.3% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $9 billion, down 4.4% driven by 5.3% yield  lower yields. Cargo revenues were down 10.4% to $174 million due primarily to a 12.7% decline in yields on international freight. Other operating revenues were $1.2 billion, down 2.1% versus the same period last year. On July 12, we did announce a new credit card agreement with Barclays card U.S., Citi and MasterCard. This agreement extends and deepens Americans relationship with its existing credit card providers and is expected to generate $200 million in pre-tax income, incremental pre-tax income in the second half of 2016. Its about $100 million each quarter, $550 million in 2017 and $800 million in 2018 with modest increases in later years of the agreement. Most of the increases will be reflected in other revenue. Total GAAP operating expenses were $8.6 billion, down 3.3% versus the same period last year due primarily to a $530 million decrease in consolidated fuel expense. Our average mainline fuel price, including taxes for the second quarter of 2016, was down 25.5% year-over-year to $1.41 per gallon. Second quarter mainline CASM was 11.32 cents, down 4.6% year-over-year due primarily due to the lower fuel costs. Excluding special items and fuel, our mainline cost per ASM was 9.12 cents, up 4% year-over-year. This increase was primarily due to contractual labor rate increases for our customer service and res agents, and the introduction of our profit sharing plan. This rate increases were offset in part mainly by maintenance timing and lower selling expenses. Regional operating cost per ASM in the second quarter was 18.78 cents, down 9.8% from 2015. Excluding special items and fuel, regional CASM has decreased by 4.6%. We ended the second quarter with approximately $9.5 billion in total available liquidity comprised with cash and investment of $7.1 billion and $2.4 billion in undrawn revolver capacity. The company also had $460 million classified as restricted cash. This is a reduction of $51 million since the last quarter. And during the second quarter, we generated $2.2 billion in cash flow from operations and paid $1.9 billion in debt. During the quarter, the company completed several efficient financing transactions, including the issuance of a new $1 billion 7-year term loan secured by the companys mainline spare parts and $844 million in JFK special facility bonds. In addition, the company issued $829 million, 2016-2 EETC consisting of AA and A tranches, which was then augmented in early July with an additional $227 million B tranche, resulted in a total deal of $1.06 billion with a blended rate of 3.5%. In the second quarter, the company returned more than $1.7 billion to its shareholders, including quarterly dividend payments of $58 million and a repurchase of $1.7 billion of common stock or 50.2 million shares. Since our capital return program started in mid-2014, the company has returned approximately $8.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Including share repurchases, shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee equity awards and share distributions and the cash extinguishment of convertible debt, our share count has dropped 29% from 756.1 million at merger close in December 2013 to 537.1 million shares on June 30, 2016. At the end of the second quarter, the company had approximately $1.2 billion remaining on its current share repurchase authorization. Our liquidity of $9.5 billion at the end of second quarter was up slightly as compared to $9.4 billion at the end of the first quarter and remains well in excess of the $6.5 billion minimum liquidity we seek to maintain for the foreseeable future. As we discussed on our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call, we believe it is important to retain liquidity levels, higher than our network peers given our overall leverage from the fact that we have not yet completed our fleet renewal program. In regard to our fleet renewal program, when we merged in 2013, both airlines had widebody fleet replacement plans that overlapped in 2017 and 18. As referenced in our earnings release, in order to spread out the widebody replacement orders and our future aircraft CapEx requirements, we announced today that on July 18, we modified our purchase agreement with Airbus for 22 A350 XWB aircraft. Under this amended agreement, we will now receive our first A350 in late 2018. The deliveries are as follows; two in late 18 and five each from 2019 to 2022. This change reduces aircraft CapEx and PDPs by approximately $500 million in 17 and approximately $700 million in 18 and provides us with capacity flexibility. As we discussed on our last earnings call, in evaluating our leverage we look at metrics such as net debt to EBITDAR as our fleet replacement program begins to normalize and with the deferral of our A350 aircraft deliveries. Going forward, our peak capital spending for aircraft will occur in 2016 and decline going forward. As we see it today, we expect our total net debt to follow the same path, peaking in 2016 and improving each year thereafter. Turning to our 2016 guidance, we continue to monitor our capacity plans and in our IR update issued two weeks ago, we lowered full year system capacity guidance by a half point and are forecasting it to be up approximately 2%, both from a domestic and international capacity, they will both be up around 2%. So, mainline capacity will be $64.1 billion in the third and $58 billion in the fourth and regional capacity $8.19 billion in the third and $7.9 billion in the fourth. Year-over-year CASM excluding special items and fuel will be up approximately 4% to 6% and regional capacity is expected to be up approximately  or down excuse me, approximately 3% to 5%. While fuel prices have risen since the beginning of the year, we continue to expect to see significant savings in  on a year-over-year basis. Based on the forward curves as of yesterday, we expect to pay between $1.39 and $1.44 per gallon in 2016. In the third quarter, we expect $1.45 to $1.50, fourth quarter, $1.48 to $1.53. Regional, we expect third quarter $1.51 to $1.56 and in the fourth quarter, $1.54 to $1.59. Based on these prices, we expect 2016 consolidated fuel expense to decrease by approximately $1.3 billion year-over-year. Using the midpoints of guidance we just provided along with the revenue guidance that Scott will give, we expect the third quarter pre-tax margin excluding special items to be between 12% and 14%. For capital expenditures, we still expect total gross aircraft CapEx to be approximately $4.4 billion in 16 with approximately $803 million occurring in the third quarter and we still expect non-aircraft CapEx to be $1.2 billion for the year. In conclusion, thanks to the efforts of our more than 100,000 team members, they again delivered strong quarterly results. While we still have a lot of work to do to fully complete our integration, we are excited about the commercial initiatives our team has implemented as well as those they are working on and look forward to reporting on our continued success on future calls. Thanks again for your time this morning. And I will turn it over to Scott will to talk about the revenue. Scott Kirby Thanks Derek. Lets start but talking a little bit about our operational performance and then turn to the revenue environment. Americans operational performance for the first half of 2016 has been strong. On a year-over-year basis for the first half of the year, all performance metrics improved for both mainline and regional operations, especially D-zero, which was up 3.3 points for mainline and 10.3 points for regional and our mishandled bag rate which has been reduced by 24%. Of course summer thunderstorms and high load factors bring incremental challenges for our team, but the people of American Airlines are continuing to do a great job taking care of our customers and improving the operation month-in and month-out. On the revenue front, 2Q PRASM came in at the high end of our forecast. And while its still a challenging revenue environment, 2Q is better or less bad than 1Q, so we have at least started to see some second derivative improvement in PRASM. Domestically, consolidated PRASM was down 5%. We saw the strongest year-over-year performance in Phoenix, followed by DFW as our second best performing year-over-year hub. Internationally, as we are beginning to overlap the dollar strengthening last year, the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and declining international fuel surcharges getting smaller and drove a 0.6% decline in PRASM. The Atlantic was once again our best performing international region despite the high levels of capacity growth, with PRASM down 6%. Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 15% on 21% ASM growth with continued weakness in both Japan and China, but good PRASM results in Hong Kong and Korea. Latin PRASM was down 10%, but we saw a particular strength in Mexico and Argentina and an improving trend in Brazil. Looking forward, we expect the third quarter to continue showing modest second derivative improvement in year-over-year PRASM. Regionally, we expect the Pacific and Atlantic to remain challenging with double-digit year-over-year PRASM declines. But domestically and in Latin America, we expect continued improvement relative to the second quarter, which will result in low single-digits PRASM declines in both entities. We see particular strength in Mexico and it appears that capacity cuts are finally starting to catch up to the declining demand in Brazil. Also, we will begin benefiting from the new credit card deals that most of that revenue will show up in other revenue. With that, we expect our total RASM  not passenger, but total RASM to be down 3.5% to 5.5% year-over-year with about 1 point of that coming from the new credit card deals. And going forward, we plan to continue guiding to total revenue  to total RASM. While we dont really have enough bookings or data to have a forecast thats any more reliable in the analyst community, as we look to 4Q and beyond, we expect to see continued second derivative improvement in the year-over-year total RASM performance and we are looking forward to getting back to growing RASM. Were also excited with our plans to introduce basic economy towards the end of this year and premium economy at some point in 2017. We believe that product segmentation is a transformative change in how we segment the product to give all of our customers choice in what they prefer, whether its more inclusive product bundle or just the bare bones, low price. Also as Derek mentioned, we also lowered our capacity guidance for the back half of the year, which is really just a normal and natural reaction to a decline in year-over-year PRASM and higher fuel environment. In conclusion, we still dislike negative RASM, but we feel good about the path that we are on to get back to RASM growth. We continue making gradual improvements in our core results. Our new credit card deal will add significantly to revenues over the next few years and we have some big opportunities ahead of us with product segmentation. When you put it altogether, we feel very good about the foundation that we are building for the long-term, which will enable us to run the worlds best operation and drive higher revenues. Doug Parker Thank you, Derek. Thank you, Scott. Operator, we are ready for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mike Linenberg Yes, hey. Actually I think Derek, you may have called this out just competitive capacity growth is being an issue on the revenue performance, where did you see  like where was that most egregious, like which markets and maybe its more domestic and maybe this is actually more a question for Scott to answer, I know you did call it out, Derek, which of your domestic markets may be have seen the most degree just sort of conditions from a competitive capacity growth perspective? Thanks. Derek Kerr Well, look there is lots of capacity growth everywhere, its not just domestically, lot of capacity growth across the Atlantic and Pacific in particular, lot of capacity growth actually in the Caribbean and Mexico. The one place, internationally, at least, where we finally started to see capacity start to right-size to  well, I dont know right-size the right term, start to at least adjust to the demand environment is South America, where Brazil actual saw declining capacity and we continue to see declining capacity going forward. Domestically, I mean, its mostly across the board. We still see higher growth in Dallas out of Love Field. The good news for us is that, that growth as we get to September, we will overlap the last phase of Southwest growth. And so at least the head to head competitive environment for us relative to where it has been will improve in September, but really there has been a lot of growth everywhere. Los Angeles has been a high growth market, but I dont think other than Dallas, I would single out any particular market for high growth. Its been across the board. Mike Linenberg Right. Just a quick follow-up to Derek, on the NOLs now, I mean, now you are booking taxes, but at what point  do you have an estimate when you believe you will be paying cash taxes? And I guess I would just presume that just based on current profitability trends, our cash taxes going to become a real thing and maybe what, 2018, 2019, any thoughts on that? Derek Kerr Yes, we are thinking right now, 2019 or 2020, but it just depends on also aircraft purchases and other things like that. So, I think we are looking at more 19 to 20 for cash taxes. Mike Linenberg Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Doug Parker Thanks Mike. Operator And we will take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Rajeev Lalwani Thanks for the time. Scott, just a question for you. We have heard a lot from other airlines as far as pressure is on closing yields and that sort of thing. What are you seeing there, just thoughts going forward? Thats the first one. Scott Kirby Okay. So, I guess we are seeing something a little different. You know all of our competitors said it. Closing yields are still down year-over-year, they are still negative, but we certainly havent seen another like down. Actually, I would have said probably quite really optically that things look marginally less bad for us on closing yields. But some of that is probably because we do I think have a little bit of a different competitive environment on a year-over-year basis. We have had some huge headwinds from a competitive perspective. Dallas Love Field is one of those big headwinds domestically that drove a lot of capacity growth in our market. And now we are starting to overlap that. And so we have what would be a more normal comparison with the rest of the industry looking forward. And so that probably means that we are seeing something perhaps its a little different than our competitors on a year-over-year basis. Secondly, we have had on a year-over-year basis, while we still probably have the most exposure to ultra low-cost carriers of any airline. They arent going in our markets anymore at least to a large degree. And so we have less of that incremental pressure and they are adding capacity in other places. And when they do that causes closing yields to decline in those markets. But we have already had that and we are overlapping now on a year-over-year basis, where they are effectively flat in our markets. And then third, we have been less involved in some of the pricing, I dont think is the right word, pricing issues going on between airlines. We have been involved on the periphery, but some others have been more involved in lowering fares in each others markets than we have and so we have probably benefited from not being quite as involved in that. Rajeev Lalwani Right, thanks. Doug, if I could ask you a quick question. As it relates to buybacks, you have obviously been pretty aggressive. Why not be even more aggressive where maybe taking the company private or something like that just given your confidence in the model? Doug Parker Well, I think we are being adequately aggressive and properly aggressive. Our view, as we stated many times is after we go through and make sure we are investing in all the right things, our people, the airline, our customers paying off high cost debts, the question then becomes of the cash we continue to generate in excess of that, what should we do with it. And certainly, given our view of the future that we described and where the market has the stock right now, it appears to us that the best use of that cash is to buyback our shares and we are doing so, I think in a reasonably aggressive way, but thats the current plan. Rajeev Lalwani Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen & Company. Helane Becker Thanks, operator. Hi, guys. Thanks for the time here. I just have a question about headcount. Do you think that there are extra people still on board  I guess thats a bad way to phrase it relative to the merger and the consolidation? And do you think that as you look out another couple of years that number starts to increase at a slower rate? Derek Kerr Yes. Helane, I would say the answer to that is yes. Our number one job is to get through the merger and complete the merger. So, there are areas where we do have extra headcount to make sure that we get the operation running right, to make sure that we complete the integration. So yes, I believe over time, we will pull it back and become more efficient, but I think right now we are doing the right things to make sure that we get everything running right and get the integration done. So, I think over time, it will come down, but over the next few years as we look forward. Helane Becker Okay. And then just another process question, I couldnt find it in the 10-Q real quickly this morning, but the intangibles from the balance sheet declined, did you have to make any adjustments for slots at Newark or anywhere else? Scott Kirby Yes, we did, but it wasnt very big. It was in the $20 million range for us, but it was very small from the Newark perspective. But we did make an adjustment and wrote those down to zero. Helane Becker Okay, great. Thank you for your help. Doug Parker Thanks, Helane. Operator Our next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay Hey, guys. Good morning. Doug Parker Hey, Hunter. Hunter Keay So I think, Scott, you said in the past that you guys expect to have the best margins in the industry amongst the legacy airline peers and thats probably looking a little bit less likely now. So if we would sort of like start here and pick one financial-oriented metric that you want American to lead the pack kind of the next 12 months from today, what would it be? Scott Kirby Well, look, I still want us to have the highest pre-tax margins amongst the network carriers. I still think we will get there. And I think we are on a good path. We took a step back from, well, a few big things that disproportionately impacted American and these kinds of things are cyclical and they will eventually come back. But you look at Venezuela first, which had RASM that was four times our system average and the country fell apart. And you had Brazil which was 80% something above system average and the country fell apart. Those were massive, massive headwinds that drove 3 to 4 points, just those two issues, 3 to 4 points of system PRASM and 3 to 4 points of margin decline. So, the hell we had to overcome to get back on those things was bigger, because those big macro exogenous events disproportionately impacted American. That said, it feels like we are  those things are about to be in the rearview mirror. Brazil is no longer a negative. Venezuela is still a big negative. Its still  RASM is going to be down 35% this coming quarter again, but its coming off a much smaller base. And so now you are something that we call out as a system level impact, because its coming off a smaller base. So, we have had some really big headwinds between that Dallas Love Field growth and those headwinds are now in the rearview mirror and we have a more normalized, at least on a year-over-year basis comparison to the rest of the industry. And I think you are starting to already see our  as we look out our RASM results start to reflect that. We have also been at least one hand tied behind our backs in the last few years as you get through integration and you have all your resources, you have systems locked down that even when you know you want to make changes you cant, because during the middle of converting the systems and our hands are getting untied now. We still have some of that work left to do but there is more coming. We would have had basic economy and premium economy, which I have said I think I will be disappointed if they are not $1 billion a year. We have those done by now if we hadnt been in the middle of integration, but we have been in the middle of integration and we have had to get through that. So, I think we are going to continue to knock those kinds of and many other smaller projects out along the way and that we are on a good path we get our credit card deal done. Others get theirs done ahead of time, we get ours done. So I feel really good about the path that we are on and ultimately our goal is to have the highest pre-tax margins amongst the network carriers. Hunter Keay Okay. So, you mentioned some of the ULCC competitive headwind shifting, do you feel vindicated, I mean I guess what you said here is, what we have learned is that it pays to kind of go nuclear when this stuff happens, so do you feel vindicated that this is happening now or do you  now that this is sort of settling down, do you feel like, well, maybe there could have been like a little bit more of a tactical way to do this without setting the house on fire, but we had to destroy the village to save it type thing or is there any like lessons learned that you can extrapolate going forward about how to compete maybe more tactically or do you have no regrets? Scott Kirby I dont agree with any of the commentary about nuclear, house on fire, any of that... Hunter Keay Fine, whatever you want to declare? Scott Kirby I think that there was absolutely no choice, but to compete and to match pricing of nonstop competitors, so just absolutely no choice. And its not a matter of vindicated or any other of those words. Its what you have to do. And its what we have done and its the right strategy. Hunter Keay Thank you. Doug Parker Thanks Hunter. Operator Our next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker Hey everybody. Doug Parker Hi Jamie. Jamie Baker I am trying to figure out a way to avoid using the term nuclear in my question now, but bazooka versus rifle or something like that. But listen Scott, you have avoided fuel hedging in the past, believing that fuel prices and passenger demand would broadly move in conjunction with one another, if you look at current revenue and GDP trends though, that time held relationship had decoupled for the first time since the financial crisis or the advent of the Internet and by the way, fuel and capacity have been volatile in the past, yet the revenue to GDP relationship was broadly unaffected, so I have two questions, first, what explains the disconnect, is it secular or self-inflicted and two, if the relationship is decoupling and continues to do so, then your primary argument against fuel hedging is no longer valid thoughts? Scott Kirby Okay. So I will try on both of those. First, I think there still is a relationship between fuel price and revenues. It comes with the lag. I have historically said four months to six months, one of our competitors said nine months. It does come with a lag. And I think revenues will be higher in the fourth quarter than it otherwise would have been if fuel was lower. Now fuel prices, whatever it was yesterday, $47 a barrel, while it took a very brief spike down to $35 a barrel, I doubt capacity ever adjusted all the way down to $35 a barrel and you saw earnings improve dramatically as a result. So I am not sure what the right comparison is if it was $35 a barrel or $47 a barrel where people were planning capacity from, but I think there still is a link. Second, I think there has been another structural change in the industry. And that has been in particular the growth of ultra low-cost carriers that was a structural change, a structural change that required a structural response. The structural response is twofold. Its one, to compete with them, which we are doing. And the second one is product segmentation. It has been a structural change in the industry, where 20 years ago we segmented customer demand based on fare rules. And if you are a business traveler, you are  the higher the fares, the low fares, which were designed for leisure customers, required a Saturday night stay, you had to buy 21 days in advance and that didnt work for business travelers. That kind of segmentation doesnt work in todays world anymore. And so we have to change the model. And changing the model is going to product segmentation, which is what basic economy and premium economy are all about. Now, I wish we could have done that by snapping our fingers like we could make a change in the fare filing and these ultra low-cost carriers grew that we could have immediately affected that change, but we couldnt. And so we had to compete first and then we will get to segmentation starting with basic economy later this year and premium economy next year. And I think thats going to address the secular change from ultra low-cost carriers. But we have taken a leg down because of that and I think we will recover once we get those things in effect. As to the fuel hedging question, there is two reasons to not hedge fuel and actually I would have said the tie to revenues is maybe the second one. The biggest reason to not hedged fuel is because its of rigged game thats impossible to be. Fuel prices, most of the time, are trading at contango. So while fuel is $47 a barrel today, if we try to buy fuel for a year from now, its well north of that. In addition, we all realize the risk that you take if you just do countless callers. And so what most people do and the prudent view is that you should buy the options. So if you want to buy an option for a fuel a year from now, Q  you are going to pay an $8 to $10 option premium. So fuel prices have to go up varies on times depending on how big the contango is and how high volatility is, but in the 30% to 50% range just to breakeven. And when you are playing a game that you have to have oil go up 30% to 50% to breakeven, its impossible to win in the long-term. You can be days that you win, but it can be months that you win, but it is impossible to win in the long-term. Jamie Baker Okay, I appreciate the input on both parts of the question. I will turn the mic over to somebody else. Take care gentlemen. Doug Parker Thanks Jamie. Jamie Baker Thanks Doug. Thanks Scott. Operator Next, we will take Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Dan McKenzie Hey. Good morning. Thanks guys. Doug Parker Hi Dan. Dan McKenzie Hey Scott, British Airways, they cut their earnings outlook following the Brexit vote and I am wondering if you can talk a little bit more about what Brexit might or might not mean for American as we look ahead. And then separately, I am wondering what you can share about BAs willingness to work with you to optimize the transatlantic flying as we look ahead? Scott Kirby So first on Brexit, I think in the near-term and I will define near-term as being until the UK actually leaves the EU. So 2-plus years, depending on when they trigger Article 50. There is sort of I think of it as three effects. One is the currency effect, which is a pretty clear negative. Actually we look that currency by currency, what has the biggest year-over-year impact, its been the Brazilian real for a long time, its now the UK pound because of the decline in currencies. And by the way, we generated about 4% of our revenues are sold in British pound. So currency decline is negative. The second point is that it will happen over the near to medium-term, the indirect direct impact, I actually think will be positive. When I say direct impact, I mean the number of people having to fly back and forth across the North Atlantic, particularly business customers as there is a lot more consultants, lawyers, bankers that are likely to be flying back and forth, figuring out what the heck this means and what are we going to do. The third and most concerning thing that will be  that has the potential to be negative is in the near to medium-term, is if it creates business confidence problems. We have seen historically, that when there is business confidence, one of the first things businesses do is cut travel and entertainment budget. Thats not something that would uniquely affect the UK or the EU, it will be a more broader impact. I was gratified to see that while the market fall for two days after the Brexit vote, it has bounced back and thats usually a pretty good indicator of confidence or highly correlated with confidence. And so I think its unlikely that we are going to see a big change of confidence. So all of which means, I think or the next few years at least, there is not going to be much impact from Brexit when you sort of do those three items. Dont have tons of data, we have a months worth of data so far and our booked revenues have improved in the month since Brexit happened, at least relative to where they were before. So hard to see any evidence that its a big problem. Longer term, the issue is going to be obviously what happens with the UK economy, what happens with the banking industry in particular because that is a big component of revenue across the transatlantic and what happens from a regulatory framework. But near-term, I dont anticipate an awful lot of issues. Dan McKenzie Comprehensive answer. Thanks. Derek... Doug Parker Thanks Dan. Dan McKenzie The board asked also. Well, I appreciate it. Derek, the reduced CapEx and cash tax perspective addresses key investor concerns that I have been getting, just given the net debt coming down, does that also mean gross adjusted debt will start coming down in 2017. And then as you think about the longer term leverage targets say, 3 years out, what could that look like? Derek Kerr Well, I think that if we look at CapEx, we talked about it being at $4.4 billion this year, goes down to $4 billion next year and then down to $2.1 billion, $2.5 billion, $2.5 billion. So the significant reduction in the CapEx will help all those leverage ratios out. So I think those will be benefited as well going out throughout the year. So, I think all of our metrics from a leverage basis get better as we go through 17, 18, 19, 20 as the aircraft CapEx gets reduced over that time period. Dan McKenzie Okay. Thanks, guys. Doug Parker Thank you, Dan. Operator Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth Hey, thanks for the time. Scott, I wonder if you could put a finer point on RASM expectations for Europe or the UK specifically. What are you expecting in terms of year-to-year change in RASM to the UK in the September quarter versus say the second quarter? Scott Kirby Well, look, Europe is probably the only region in the world that I think is going to get sequentially worse from the second quarter to the third quarter. Specifically, it will be about the same on RASM, domestic and Latin, as I said in my opening comments, going to get better. We do expect Europe to get worse, although its really core Europe more than it is the UK. Europe has several almost, I guess, three strikes against it looking forward. Its, one, there is more economic uncertainty. Its not just from Brexit, there is more economic uncertainty and its a challenging economic environment in Europe, so the macro is not good. You got accelerating capacity growth across the Atlantic. So, its a second strike for Europe. And third is currency. So, the one impact of Brexit that actually is identifiable negative is currency weakness. So, those three things, I mean, thats the one region of the world that we think is actually going to sequentially get worse in the third quarter, but its really not a UK issue, its actually more core Europe than it is UK from our perspective. Duane Pfennigwerth Appreciate that. You wouldnt care to put a finer point on it of how much you expect RASM to be down next quarter? Scott Kirby Well, I said double-digits in my opening comments and I am not going to put a finer point on it than that. Duane Pfennigwerth Okay. And then the comments on Latin are really interesting, maybe you could help us put some context around Brazil. Could you remind us how much your capacity is down 3Q versus 2Q and what the shape of RASM you are expecting? So for example, we have heard some others that maybe long-haul international to Brazil went from like down 35 to down 25, which is sequential improvement, but its still pretty weak for you, your capacity cuts are much greater than that, so maybe revenues or maybe RASM is still sort of flattish. Any help you can give us there will be appreciated? Scott Kirby Yes, we have cut capacity  I dont know 3Q or just 2Q, we started cutting capacity in 2015 and we could see these results clearly deteriorating. We were surprised actually in 2015. I think, every carrier that flies from Brazil to the United States not only increased capacity, but increased capacity by double-digits, except for American Airlines. So, I think we are probably down 35% to 40% from where we were back in 14 today. But in the second quarter for the first time, we actually saw industry capacity come down. Its going to come down even more in the third and fourth quarter. And as a result, Brazil, which was running down kind of 35%, in the second quarter RASM was down 13%, in the third quarter, we expect it to be positive. Now, we are getting a boost in the third quarter from the Olympics. So, I wouldnt necessarily expect the fourth quarter to remain positive. Although our guess is right now that the fourth quarter will remain positive. There has just been an awful lot of capacity come out and you just got to such a low level, I mean, the RASM will still be down. I dont know the number, 40%, 50% from where it was at the peak even if it turns positive in the third and fourth quarter, but its certainly  it feels like its not getting worse anymore. Its not really on  its coming off a low base. Its not really on a rapid recovery, but it does feel like its not getting worse anymore. Duane Pfennigwerth Thank you for that. So, maybe RASM positive on capacity down double-digits for you? Scott Kirby I dont know what our capacity is right now. As I look at it on our overall longer time horizon, over a longer time horizon, we are down probably close to 40%, but I dont know what it is 3Q versus 2Q. Duane Pfennigwerth Okay, thank you for the detailed answers. Thank you. Appreciate it. Doug Parker Thanks. Operator Next, we will take Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Doug Parker Hi, Julie. Julie Yates Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Derek, one for you on the CapEx decline in 2017 and 2018 starts to free up some free cash flow, what are your priorities, are there additional opportunities to prepay debt, and is this meant to help with the pension funding requirement coming in 2019? Derek Kerr Yes, two things. One it will be we are going to use cash to complete the integration and continue to do all the projects that we are  we have got on the list as Scott talked about, basic economy, premium economy, cash will definitely go to that first. As we look at pension requirements, our first pension requirement payment is in 19. We have a small requirement in 18, but the biggest requirement is in 19. We do have the possibility to do that early on the pensions in 18 if we want to get 80% funded in the 18 timeframe. So, thats a possibility to do, but its not required to do our requirement is in 19 to do that. So, I think the biggest uses are going to be making sure that we have enough CapEx. We have $1.2 billion this year in CapEx. We expect that to maintain, if not grow a little bit in 17 and 18 just due to all the projects and the backup demand thats there for everybody. So, I think thats where we will more likely go than any early pension payments, the requirement and the pensions in 19. Julie Yates Okay, very helpful. And then Scott, one for you, from the last year, we have seen the weakness from competitive actions is really contained. How much do you worry about that when you observe whats going on in other markets with the other airlines that you mentioned? Scott Kirby Well, look, its a really competitive environment and its still a yield in RASM, negative environment across the board. So, we are impacted by that. I think we get better at competing in that environment. The more experience we get with it, we work  learn things that work, learn things that we can do better, but the biggest thing we can do really is the structural response. And I know on these calls we typically focused on whats going to happen in the next quarter or the next three weeks and have a pretty short-term focus on it. But the biggest thing we can do is get the product segmentation right, not just for investors, but for our customers, where we can give customers what they are looking for, whether they want a really cheap barebones low price or whether they want a product that has more amenities and is a higher quality product. And its taking us time to get that done, but thats really the right structural response. So, we feel pretty good about where we are. We think that we are on a continuing trajectory and we expected to have a positive trajectory to get back to positive PRASM that happened this quarter and we expect it happen in the second quarter and expect it in the third quarter. And we think we are going to continue on that trend. So, we wish it was PRASM was positive today. We wish we had a benign competitive environment, but we have what we have and we think we are making good progress. Derek Kerr And Julie, this is Derek. Just one follow-up to that question. From a debt  non-aircraft debt payments, next year, its only $100 million for us. Year after that, its only $600 million. We do have an unsecured bond in 18 and we will  if there is any opportunities to prepay any high cost debt, which we have done a significant amount of and we will do at any point we can, we will use that cash to prepay any of that. We dont have any planned in 17 and 18, but if we find things that we can prepay early, we will use any cash to do that in 17 and 18. Julie Yates Okay, great. And then, Scott Doug Parker Its only because we have a lot of our employees who listen into these calls and you mentioned that pension, I just want to make sure I explain to everybody kind of whats going on there. The issue is you may or may not be doing that Julie. I mean, we are fully funded per some airline pension funding rules and more funded in that regard than our competitors on the pensions. We, at American, are required because of the way these  because of the fact, frankly, the American didnt file a bankruptcy and Delta Northwest did or Delta United did, we are required to move off that funding plan and two other funding plans sooner than they are. And as Derek said, I think thats 18 or 19 for us. So, that will require us to move up to a higher level at that time. We could do it today if we wanted to. This is not a funding issue. It will never be a funding issue. Its just whats the right time to pay debt amortizations, and this is  so we will pay that when  we will fund at that as we are required to. We are fully funded now higher than our competitors and will be funded at a rate higher than them when we do this. But we dont think  none of us think its in the best interest of the company to go fund it in advance or to be over-funded on something that doesnt have a return. So we will keep doing until that we are well aware that its not an issue whatsoever and its fully manageable, it can be funded now. Julie Yates Okay. Thanks Doug. And then just one last one for you Scott, on corporate, its been a pretty big topic on some of the other calls and you guys havent mentioned it, what  can you give us an update on what trends you are seeing from a corporate perspective? Scott Kirby Well, they continue as they have been. We had corporate demand up and we continue to win share. I think corporate revenue was down 1% for us in the quarter, so obviously its outperforming the rest of the system. But I think its much like it has been. Corporate demand is strong, but we have a lot of low fares in the markets, so we are getting the deal right now. Julie Yates Got it. Thanks so much. Operator Our next question comes from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi Hi guys. Thanks for the time. Maybe I would like to follow-up on Jamies question Scott, with regard to some of the secular trends that were perhaps one of the thing you would called out, the growth of low cost carriers, but one of the things that I have been thinking a little bit harder about more recently is that we have also seen a lot of frequency acceleration here over the last few years and I am just wondering if maybe you thought perhaps, the quality of the schedule having deteriorated a bit could have also driven some of the decoupling that we have seen in that historical relationship between airline revenue and GDP and just any thoughts around that? Scott Kirby I dont think so. I mean one of the things that is a close analog to that probably is every airline has increased density on aircraft. And so we have done it, but all of our competitors have as well. And at least as with regard to RASM, that we typically think of those extra seats is coming in at 50% of system RASM. And so we put another 12 seats on the 737-800s that, that 12 seats is 6% of capacity, it means that all those flights come in, the RASM is 3% lower than it otherwise would have been, they are profit positive. But I think that is  that is probably a change that has driven lower RASM, at least across the industry, it has a corresponding benefit on the cost side of course, that would drive lower RASM. But we still have high quality schedules for business travelers. And I dont think business travelers are flying less because maybe you have 14 flights a day in a market instead of 15 flights a day, I dont think you are really losing any business. But people are resigned to stay home because of that. Darryl Genovesi Okay. And then you had also mentioned that you thought the Olympics were going to be a positive, down in Brazil, I remember 2 years ago when we had the World Cup down dont there, you saw some very close-in revenue deterioration, bookings deterioration, which I think was related to hotel availability, do you think that, thats likely going to be an issue again this time? Scott Kirby Well, usually, the Olympics, World Cups, conventions are a negative for revenues, because business travelers just stay away, because they cant get hotels and worry about the crowds and some business travel dries up. We have seen that in all other Olympics. We have seen that in the World Cup. In this case, Brazil is so bad that there is no business traffic or close to no business traffic. As of this year, I think there will be a positive just because Brazil has fallen so much before. 2 years ago, I would have thought the Olympics would be a negative and it would have been 2 years ago. But today, because things have fallen so much, they are going to actually be a positive. Darryl Genovesi Great. And then if I could squeeze one last one, I just like a point of clarification for Derek. Derek I think you said CapEx was coming down by $500 million in 17 and $700 million in 18, is that just aircraft CapEx or is that total CapEx and I think you said there was also an offset on the non-aircraft one? Derek Kerr Thats just aircraft CapEx. Right now, we are showing $1.2 billion in 16 for non-aircraft CapEx. We think it will go up to $1.5 billion in 17 and then probably $1.5 billion, I just put $1.5 billion for both 17 and 18 as we finish off and then will drop off in 19 and 20. So I am trying to get done with all the basic economy, premium economy, all of the interior work that we are doing and all of the completion of all the merger activity we will have higher non-aircraft CapEx in 17 and 18, but then get back to that $1.2 billion, $1 billion run rate in 19 and 20. Darryl Genovesi Would you just provide the total gross CapEx as you see it today for those years? Derek Kerr Yes. I have 5.6 in 16, 5.5 in 17, 3.6 in 18, 3.6 in 19 and 3.2 in 20. Darryl Genovesi Thank you. Operator Our next question is coming from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth Hi, good morning. Actually if I could first ask a follow-up to Julies question on the corporate demand, can you just talk about like what the volume trend has been over the last several quarters and if thats similar or have you seen maybe a deceleration in that trend? Scott Kirby I think they have been similar. Not a real change from the corporate demand environment. Savi Syth Alright, great. And then just switching to the kind of the non-fuel cost side, on the pre pre-agreed profit sharing basis, if I look at the full year guide, it seems that there is a lot of pressure here in 2016, I am just wondering whats driving that and when we might see some of the kind of the benefits from merger or integration related benefits benefiting the cost side and maybe just some early thoughts on what we might see from the headwinds and tailwinds in 2017? Scott Kirby Yes. I think whats driving this year is primarily for a full year effect, its salaries and benefits and adding back in the profit sharing. So that of a full year, we have guided right around 5, thats almost 4.5 of it. The third quarter change from the second quarter is really driven by maintenance timing. I think we had a 1.7% good guy in maintenance in the first quarter, 1% in the second quarter and its shifting almost exactly opposite in the third and fourth quarter with about a 1.6 headwind in the third and a 1.4 headwind in the fourth. So its really a shift in the maintenance timing. Year-over-year, our maintenance is flat, its up 0.1, so its virtually flat. But its the timing of things moving from this year in the third and fourth quarter more than last year being in the first and second quarter, so thats really the year-over-year timing. As we look forward, we dont  we still have one contract to do that is not in our guidance, that we are still working hard to get our mechanics in our RAMP contract done and we want to get that done as soon as possible. That would be the biggest headwind going into next year from a CASM perspective. Other than that, we believe we should be in the zero to 2% range going forward and we dont see any major CASM headwinds looking out into 17 or 18. Savi Syth If I may follow-up on that, from a gauge standpoint, whats the trend is there going to be, kind of maybe its a zero to 2% would rely on the gauge improvement? Derek Kerr Gauge improvements from an aircraft perspective? Savi Syth Exactly? Derek Kerr There is still some gauge increase. Some of that is going as we modify the aircraft, so maybe 0.5% of that will be gauge driven. Savi Syth Okay. And then just from kind of on the regional side, there is not a lot more left then, from kind of up-gauging there? Derek Kerr Correct. There is only from a delivery perspective, we only have about 12 aircraft of gauge coming in 17, so there will be some effect from the 16. We had 42 aircraft coming in 16, so there will be a little bit affect that next year. This year, we had a gauge difference of about, from an ASM perspective, of about 3.3. Next year, its probably about half of that, 1.5 points to 2 points on the regional perspective. Savi Syth Alright, great. Thank you. Operator Next, we will take the question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Derek and Scott, I just want to talk about kind of the capacity reductions you announced, I guess it was last week, one of your peers have said that its essentially too expensive for them to pull capacity starting in fourth quarter, so I just want to understand, when you guys ran the numbers on pulling ASMs, was it dilutive to earnings and you were just willing to accept that to try and regain some pricing power or was it not? Derek Kerr No, we think its the right thing to do. We think its earnings positive in that world. I mean look, in a world where RASM is declining and/or fuel prices were going up, it just becomes mathematically true that everything across your system gets a little worse. And so the bottom 1% has a higher probability that its no longer profitable. It is true that you cant get 100% of the cost out in the short-term that does drive CASM pressure for us, but we think that, that the capacity changes we made are both revenue and earnings positive beginning in the fourth quarter even though we cant get 100% of the cost out. Joseph DeNardi Okay, okay. And then Derek, you have talked in some detail about the CapEx and debt profile over the next couple of years, can you just talk about just on the interest expense line when and at what level that, that number peaks and then starts to come down over the next couple of years? Derek Kerr On the interest expense line? Joseph DeNardi Yes. Derek Kerr Let me see. Let me try to grab that for the 5-year plan. Go ahead and ask another one and I will pull that question and I will pull that answer. Doug Parker What else you got, Joe? Joseph DeNardi I was going to try and stick to two, so I will let somebody else get on. Doug Parker We are still long enough... Derek Kerr It should stay pretty stable where we have it right now. So, our interest expense line in 16 is forecast to be right about at $1 billion and we forecast it for the next. Depending on what we do, I think, right now, we expect to finance a fair amount of those aircraft, so if we do that, we will reduce that pretty much commensurate with what we bring on. So, our interest expense should stay pretty flat over the next 5 years under that methodology. And we have reduced the cost of the debt from 5% down almost to 4% debt, which is as we have refinanced and financed these aircraft at really attractive rates we have reduced our overall cost of debt down to around 4%. Joseph DeNardi Great, thank you very much. Doug Parker Thanks, Joseph. Operator Our next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here guys. I guess just to go back to the revenue initiatives and cabin segmentation for a moment, I know the plan is to have basic economy by the end of this year. But can you give us a sense for when you would expect those initiatives to really start having some noticeable improvement on the P&L in terms of your RASM or PRASM? Derek Kerr So basic economy, I think we will start to have an impact probably on March of next year what I would say. And then premium economy, while we will roll it out at some point in 17 because it will also be tied in  we are going to treat premium economy like a separate cabin essentially. So different than what other airlines might call premium economy today, more expansive, more what it looks like or more how its treated internationally or how we are going to treat it internationally as a separate cabin. And because of that, it will have impact on the frequent flyer program and so that will probably be for 2018 really because we need to tell our frequent flyers in advance how it impacts the frequent flyer program. Jack Atkins Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on that then, is there a way to sort of put some brackets around the value you would expect that to generate to your earnings stream over the course of the next, call it 3 to 5 years? Scott Kirby I am going to be disappointed if its not a $1 billion a year. Jack Atkins Okay, thank you very much. Doug Parker Thank you. Operator And now we will begin the media portion of the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Susan Carey with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Susan Carey Good morning. Two probably for Scott. I think, Scott, at the outset, I understood you to say that your 3Q guidance is going to be for RASM, down 3.5% to 5.5% and I believe I understood you to say you were abandoning PRASM and you were going to be adopting the RASM model going forward. Am I getting that right? Scott Kirby Well, I didnt say abandon, but yes, thats right. Its the better metric to look at more an increasing percentage of our revenues come in the other revenue line. The credit card deal is obviously a big component of that. But also as we move into a world of basic economy and premium economy, there will be a higher amount of revenues that come in other revenues, and thats really the most important metric. So, we are going to be guiding to RASM on a going forward basis. Susan Carey And okay, so  and the other question I think an analyst asked it, you said there are  Brexit is not really going to have a big impact on you for the foreseeable future, except on the ForEx front, but I think the guy asked, what are you going to do about coordinating, with VA across the pond in case there has to be some kind of capacity adjustment? Is it premature to talk about that right now or is that something thats in your planning horizon? Scott Kirby Well look, we have a great relationship with IAG and we talk to them all the time about what the right amount of capacity is and will this continue in the normal course in that process and we will react as we see things happen in the market, but there is nothing specific to talk about today. Susan Carey Thank you. Doug Parker Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Jeffrey Dastin with Reuters. Jeffrey Dastin Hi, thank you for taking the question. Perhaps I missed this, but could you specify any markets or if there is particular region that will be impacted by the Airbus deferrals? Scott Kirby Well, we didnt specify and there really isnt, because we still have to work through the plans on where we are going to fly with the existing fleet. It  really, what this does is give us flexibility. All these aircraft were scheduled to be replacement aircraft for existing aircraft and so we can extend some of the leases longer to keep the existing flying and/or growth plans in place or given a weak international environment, we can keep some of those requirements in place as they were and pullback on what our growth plans otherwise would have been. So, it really just gives us flexibility. Jeffrey Dastin Great, thank you. And one follow-up question or unrelated question, how are bookings shaping up for cities in Cuba so far? Scott Kirby You know, I dont know. Jeffrey Dastin Right, thank you. Doug Parker We will get some of that back to you, Jeffrey. Jeffrey Dastin Great, thank you. Doug Parker Sure. Operator Next, we will take Edward Russell with Flightglobal. Edward Russell Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to understand why you are choosing to do the A350 deferrals now? You have the U.S. Airways and American order books back in 2013, so why the decision to do this now versus a year ago or so? Scott Kirby Well, in order to defer, you cant just unilaterally decide to defer aircraft and call Airbus or Boeing up and say, hey, we are going to defer aircraft and they say, okay. You have to work it out with them. And so we have just needed to find a point in time, where it was in Airbus best interest to defer the orders and ours. And so the timing is really about when it works for both sets of partners. Edward Russell Okay. I mean, one of the things that comes up I think of is I mean, Airbus has already started cutting metal for first half 17 deliveries at this point. So, I mean do you have any color on where you penalized for doing a deferral now or that it was just in the best interest? Scott Kirby No, this was something Airbus also wanted and so we were able to work out a win-win for Airbus and American and... Doug Parker Yes, hey, Edward, its Doug. I mean, look anyway, first off as you know, we came in with two realms of two large fleet orders and we have been trying to get them better coordinated this helps. And on the Airbus front, you should talk to them, but its been a very popular product as you know and they sold a lot of them and they are trying to meet all their customers needs and this deferral, I think, was consistent with that. Scott Kirby We did defer 4 787s last year, so... Doug Parker So, it worked out well for us and presumably worked out well for Airbus, but we did not  we certainly did not pay any penalties for it. Edward Russell Got it. Thank you very much. Operator And our next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein Hi, good morning. There has been some kind of dire forecast out of Europe, European airlines on the impact on travel demand from the terror incidents. Are you guys seeing anything or do you expect to see anything from that? Scott Kirby Well, we dont have anyway of knowing why bookings are lower or why revenue is weaker. Europe is the one area that is going to sequentially get worse in the third quarter than the second quarter. But whether its that or whether its the economic weakness or whether its Brexit or whether its just the currency impact or whether its all the capacity growth, there is a lot of things that could be driving it and its probably all of the above. Mary Schlangenstein Yes, thank you. Operator And our last question is coming from Ted Reed with The Street. Please go ahead. Ted Reed Thank you. Two quick things. First of all, first Delta said they were going to cut to UK by 6%, then United said incremental cuts, and now you are saying no cuts to UK. So whats the difference is just the traffic doing better than everybody thought? Scott Kirby Well, I dont think we said anything about what we are going to do in the UK. Ted Reed What are you going to do in the UK? Scott Kirby We havent said anything. Ted Reed Alright. And the other thing I wondered about is I was surprised  people were surprised when you put the 787-9 on to go to Madrid instead of to Asia, what was your thinking behind that? Scott Kirby Well, we have got a partner in Madrid with a hub there and we just thought it was the right route to come. There is going to be 78s, 9s that will be flying to Asia. We are taking a lot of deliveries and they will be coming, but starting it off, it worked for the aircraft rotation and worked flying into one of our partners hubs. Ted Reed Alright, thank you. Doug Parker Thanks Ted. Operator And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Doug Parker Alright. We have no additional closing remarks other than thank you and please let us know if you have any further questions. We appreciate your time.

[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mike Linenberg Yes, hey. Actually I think Derek, you may have called this out just competitive capacity growth is being an issue on the revenue performance, where did you see  like where was that most egregious, like which markets and maybe its more domestic and maybe this is actually more a question for Scott to answer, I know you did call it out, Derek, which of your domestic markets may be have seen the most degree just sort of conditions from a competitive capacity growth perspective? Thanks. Derek Kerr Well, look there is lots of capacity growth everywhere, its not just domestically, lot of capacity growth across the Atlantic and Pacific in particular, lot of capacity growth actually in the Caribbean and Mexico. The one place, internationally, at least, where we finally started to see capacity start to right-size to  well, I dont know right-size the right term, start to at least adjust to the demand environment is South America, where Brazil actual saw declining capacity and we continue to see declining capacity going forward. Domestically, I mean, its mostly across the board. We still see higher growth in Dallas out of Love Field. The good news for us is that, that growth as we get to September, we will overlap the last phase of Southwest growth. And so at least the head to head competitive environment for us relative to where it has been will improve in September, but really there has been a lot of growth everywhere. Los Angeles has been a high growth market, but I dont think other than Dallas, I would single out any particular market for high growth. Its been across the board. Mike Linenberg Right. Just a quick follow-up to Derek, on the NOLs now, I mean, now you are booking taxes, but at what point  do you have an estimate when you believe you will be paying cash taxes? And I guess I would just presume that just based on current profitability trends, our cash taxes going to become a real thing and maybe what, 2018, 2019, any thoughts on that? Derek Kerr Yes, we are thinking right now, 2019 or 2020, but it just depends on also aircraft purchases and other things like that. So, I think we are looking at more 19 to 20 for cash taxes. Mike Linenberg Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Doug Parker Thanks Mike. Operator And we will take our next question from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Rajeev Lalwani Thanks for the time. Scott, just a question for you. We have heard a lot from other airlines as far as pressure is on closing yields and that sort of thing. What are you seeing there, just thoughts going forward? Thats the first one. Scott Kirby Okay. So, I guess we are seeing something a little different. You know all of our competitors said it. Closing yields are still down year-over-year, they are still negative, but we certainly havent seen another like down. Actually, I would have said probably quite really optically that things look marginally less bad for us on closing yields. But some of that is probably because we do I think have a little bit of a different competitive environment on a year-over-year basis. We have had some huge headwinds from a competitive perspective. Dallas Love Field is one of those big headwinds domestically that drove a lot of capacity growth in our market. And now we are starting to overlap that. And so we have what would be a more normal comparison with the rest of the industry looking forward. And so that probably means that we are seeing something perhaps its a little different than our competitors on a year-over-year basis. Secondly, we have had on a year-over-year basis, while we still probably have the most exposure to ultra low-cost carriers of any airline. They arent going in our markets anymore at least to a large degree. And so we have less of that incremental pressure and they are adding capacity in other places. And when they do that causes closing yields to decline in those markets. But we have already had that and we are overlapping now on a year-over-year basis, where they are effectively flat in our markets. And then third, we have been less involved in some of the pricing, I dont think is the right word, pricing issues going on between airlines. We have been involved on the periphery, but some others have been more involved in lowering fares in each others markets than we have and so we have probably benefited from not being quite as involved in that. Rajeev Lalwani Right, thanks. Doug, if I could ask you a quick question. As it relates to buybacks, you have obviously been pretty aggressive. Why not be even more aggressive where maybe taking the company private or something like that just given your confidence in the model? Doug Parker Well, I think we are being adequately aggressive and properly aggressive. Our view, as we stated many times is after we go through and make sure we are investing in all the right things, our people, the airline, our customers paying off high cost debts, the question then becomes of the cash we continue to generate in excess of that, what should we do with it. And certainly, given our view of the future that we described and where the market has the stock right now, it appears to us that the best use of that cash is to buyback our shares and we are doing so, I think in a reasonably aggressive way, but thats the current plan. Rajeev Lalwani Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen & Company. Helane Becker Thanks, operator. Hi, guys. Thanks for the time here. I just have a question about headcount. Do you think that there are extra people still on board  I guess thats a bad way to phrase it relative to the merger and the consolidation? And do you think that as you look out another couple of years that number starts to increase at a slower rate? Derek Kerr Yes. Helane, I would say the answer to that is yes. Our number one job is to get through the merger and complete the merger. So, there are areas where we do have extra headcount to make sure that we get the operation running right, to make sure that we complete the integration. So yes, I believe over time, we will pull it back and become more efficient, but I think right now we are doing the right things to make sure that we get everything running right and get the integration done. So, I think over time, it will come down, but over the next few years as we look forward. Helane Becker Okay. And then just another process question, I couldnt find it in the 10-Q real quickly this morning, but the intangibles from the balance sheet declined, did you have to make any adjustments for slots at Newark or anywhere else? Scott Kirby Yes, we did, but it wasnt very big. It was in the $20 million range for us, but it was very small from the Newark perspective. But we did make an adjustment and wrote those down to zero. Helane Becker Okay, great. Thank you for your help. Doug Parker Thanks, Helane. Operator Our next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay Hey, guys. Good morning. Doug Parker Hey, Hunter. Hunter Keay So I think, Scott, you said in the past that you guys expect to have the best margins in the industry amongst the legacy airline peers and thats probably looking a little bit less likely now. So if we would sort of like start here and pick one financial-oriented metric that you want American to lead the pack kind of the next 12 months from today, what would it be? Scott Kirby Well, look, I still want us to have the highest pre-tax margins amongst the network carriers. I still think we will get there. And I think we are on a good path. We took a step back from, well, a few big things that disproportionately impacted American and these kinds of things are cyclical and they will eventually come back. But you look at Venezuela first, which had RASM that was four times our system average and the country fell apart. And you had Brazil which was 80% something above system average and the country fell apart. Those were massive, massive headwinds that drove 3 to 4 points, just those two issues, 3 to 4 points of system PRASM and 3 to 4 points of margin decline. So, the hell we had to overcome to get back on those things was bigger, because those big macro exogenous events disproportionately impacted American. That said, it feels like we are  those things are about to be in the rearview mirror. Brazil is no longer a negative. Venezuela is still a big negative. Its still  RASM is going to be down 35% this coming quarter again, but its coming off a much smaller base. And so now you are something that we call out as a system level impact, because its coming off a smaller base. So, we have had some really big headwinds between that Dallas Love Field growth and those headwinds are now in the rearview mirror and we have a more normalized, at least on a year-over-year basis comparison to the rest of the industry. And I think you are starting to already see our  as we look out our RASM results start to reflect that. We have also been at least one hand tied behind our backs in the last few years as you get through integration and you have all your resources, you have systems locked down that even when you know you want to make changes you cant, because during the middle of converting the systems and our hands are getting untied now. We still have some of that work left to do but there is more coming. We would have had basic economy and premium economy, which I have said I think I will be disappointed if they are not $1 billion a year. We have those done by now if we hadnt been in the middle of integration, but we have been in the middle of integration and we have had to get through that. So, I think we are going to continue to knock those kinds of and many other smaller projects out along the way and that we are on a good path we get our credit card deal done. Others get theirs done ahead of time, we get ours done. So I feel really good about the path that we are on and ultimately our goal is to have the highest pre-tax margins amongst the network carriers. Hunter Keay Okay. So, you mentioned some of the ULCC competitive headwind shifting, do you feel vindicated, I mean I guess what you said here is, what we have learned is that it pays to kind of go nuclear when this stuff happens, so do you feel vindicated that this is happening now or do you  now that this is sort of settling down, do you feel like, well, maybe there could have been like a little bit more of a tactical way to do this without setting the house on fire, but we had to destroy the village to save it type thing or is there any like lessons learned that you can extrapolate going forward about how to compete maybe more tactically or do you have no regrets? Scott Kirby I dont agree with any of the commentary about nuclear, house on fire, any of that... Hunter Keay Fine, whatever you want to declare? Scott Kirby I think that there was absolutely no choice, but to compete and to match pricing of nonstop competitors, so just absolutely no choice. And its not a matter of vindicated or any other of those words. Its what you have to do. And its what we have done and its the right strategy. Hunter Keay Thank you. Doug Parker Thanks Hunter. Operator Our next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker Hey everybody. Doug Parker Hi Jamie. Jamie Baker I am trying to figure out a way to avoid using the term nuclear in my question now, but bazooka versus rifle or something like that. But listen Scott, you have avoided fuel hedging in the past, believing that fuel prices and passenger demand would broadly move in conjunction with one another, if you look at current revenue and GDP trends though, that time held relationship had decoupled for the first time since the financial crisis or the advent of the Internet and by the way, fuel and capacity have been volatile in the past, yet the revenue to GDP relationship was broadly unaffected, so I have two questions, first, what explains the disconnect, is it secular or self-inflicted and two, if the relationship is decoupling and continues to do so, then your primary argument against fuel hedging is no longer valid thoughts? Scott Kirby Okay. So I will try on both of those. First, I think there still is a relationship between fuel price and revenues. It comes with the lag. I have historically said four months to six months, one of our competitors said nine months. It does come with a lag. And I think revenues will be higher in the fourth quarter than it otherwise would have been if fuel was lower. Now fuel prices, whatever it was yesterday, $47 a barrel, while it took a very brief spike down to $35 a barrel, I doubt capacity ever adjusted all the way down to $35 a barrel and you saw earnings improve dramatically as a result. So I am not sure what the right comparison is if it was $35 a barrel or $47 a barrel where people were planning capacity from, but I think there still is a link. Second, I think there has been another structural change in the industry. And that has been in particular the growth of ultra low-cost carriers that was a structural change, a structural change that required a structural response. The structural response is twofold. Its one, to compete with them, which we are doing. And the second one is product segmentation. It has been a structural change in the industry, where 20 years ago we segmented customer demand based on fare rules. And if you are a business traveler, you are  the higher the fares, the low fares, which were designed for leisure customers, required a Saturday night stay, you had to buy 21 days in advance and that didnt work for business travelers. That kind of segmentation doesnt work in todays world anymore. And so we have to change the model. And changing the model is going to product segmentation, which is what basic economy and premium economy are all about. Now, I wish we could have done that by snapping our fingers like we could make a change in the fare filing and these ultra low-cost carriers grew that we could have immediately affected that change, but we couldnt. And so we had to compete first and then we will get to segmentation starting with basic economy later this year and premium economy next year. And I think thats going to address the secular change from ultra low-cost carriers. But we have taken a leg down because of that and I think we will recover once we get those things in effect. As to the fuel hedging question, there is two reasons to not hedge fuel and actually I would have said the tie to revenues is maybe the second one. The biggest reason to not hedged fuel is because its of rigged game thats impossible to be. Fuel prices, most of the time, are trading at contango. So while fuel is $47 a barrel today, if we try to buy fuel for a year from now, its well north of that. In addition, we all realize the risk that you take if you just do countless callers. And so what most people do and the prudent view is that you should buy the options. So if you want to buy an option for a fuel a year from now, Q  you are going to pay an $8 to $10 option premium. So fuel prices have to go up varies on times depending on how big the contango is and how high volatility is, but in the 30% to 50% range just to breakeven. And when you are playing a game that you have to have oil go up 30% to 50% to breakeven, its impossible to win in the long-term. You can be days that you win, but it can be months that you win, but it is impossible to win in the long-term. Jamie Baker Okay, I appreciate the input on both parts of the question. I will turn the mic over to somebody else. Take care gentlemen. Doug Parker Thanks Jamie. Jamie Baker Thanks Doug. Thanks Scott. Operator Next, we will take Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Dan McKenzie Hey. Good morning. Thanks guys. Doug Parker Hi Dan. Dan McKenzie Hey Scott, British Airways, they cut their earnings outlook following the Brexit vote and I am wondering if you can talk a little bit more about what Brexit might or might not mean for American as we look ahead. And then separately, I am wondering what you can share about BAs willingness to work with you to optimize the transatlantic flying as we look ahead? Scott Kirby So first on Brexit, I think in the near-term and I will define near-term as being until the UK actually leaves the EU. So 2-plus years, depending on when they trigger Article 50. There is sort of I think of it as three effects. One is the currency effect, which is a pretty clear negative. Actually we look that currency by currency, what has the biggest year-over-year impact, its been the Brazilian real for a long time, its now the UK pound because of the decline in currencies. And by the way, we generated about 4% of our revenues are sold in British pound. So currency decline is negative. The second point is that it will happen over the near to medium-term, the indirect direct impact, I actually think will be positive. When I say direct impact, I mean the number of people having to fly back and forth across the North Atlantic, particularly business customers as there is a lot more consultants, lawyers, bankers that are likely to be flying back and forth, figuring out what the heck this means and what are we going to do. The third and most concerning thing that will be  that has the potential to be negative is in the near to medium-term, is if it creates business confidence problems. We have seen historically, that when there is business confidence, one of the first things businesses do is cut travel and entertainment budget. Thats not something that would uniquely affect the UK or the EU, it will be a more broader impact. I was gratified to see that while the market fall for two days after the Brexit vote, it has bounced back and thats usually a pretty good indicator of confidence or highly correlated with confidence. And so I think its unlikely that we are going to see a big change of confidence. So all of which means, I think or the next few years at least, there is not going to be much impact from Brexit when you sort of do those three items. Dont have tons of data, we have a months worth of data so far and our booked revenues have improved in the month since Brexit happened, at least relative to where they were before. So hard to see any evidence that its a big problem. Longer term, the issue is going to be obviously what happens with the UK economy, what happens with the banking industry in particular because that is a big component of revenue across the transatlantic and what happens from a regulatory framework. But near-term, I dont anticipate an awful lot of issues. Dan McKenzie Comprehensive answer. Thanks. Derek... Doug Parker Thanks Dan. Dan McKenzie The board asked also. Well, I appreciate it. Derek, the reduced CapEx and cash tax perspective addresses key investor concerns that I have been getting, just given the net debt coming down, does that also mean gross adjusted debt will start coming down in 2017. And then as you think about the longer term leverage targets say, 3 years out, what could that look like? Derek Kerr Well, I think that if we look at CapEx, we talked about it being at $4.4 billion this year, goes down to $4 billion next year and then down to $2.1 billion, $2.5 billion, $2.5 billion. So the significant reduction in the CapEx will help all those leverage ratios out. So I think those will be benefited as well going out throughout the year. So, I think all of our metrics from a leverage basis get better as we go through 17, 18, 19, 20 as the aircraft CapEx gets reduced over that time period. Dan McKenzie Okay. Thanks, guys. Doug Parker Thank you, Dan. Operator Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth Hey, thanks for the time. Scott, I wonder if you could put a finer point on RASM expectations for Europe or the UK specifically. What are you expecting in terms of year-to-year change in RASM to the UK in the September quarter versus say the second quarter? Scott Kirby Well, look, Europe is probably the only region in the world that I think is going to get sequentially worse from the second quarter to the third quarter. Specifically, it will be about the same on RASM, domestic and Latin, as I said in my opening comments, going to get better. We do expect Europe to get worse, although its really core Europe more than it is the UK. Europe has several almost, I guess, three strikes against it looking forward. Its, one, there is more economic uncertainty. Its not just from Brexit, there is more economic uncertainty and its a challenging economic environment in Europe, so the macro is not good. You got accelerating capacity growth across the Atlantic. So, its a second strike for Europe. And third is currency. So, the one impact of Brexit that actually is identifiable negative is currency weakness. So, those three things, I mean, thats the one region of the world that we think is actually going to sequentially get worse in the third quarter, but its really not a UK issue, its actually more core Europe than it is UK from our perspective. Duane Pfennigwerth Appreciate that. You wouldnt care to put a finer point on it of how much you expect RASM to be down next quarter? Scott Kirby Well, I said double-digits in my opening comments and I am not going to put a finer point on it than that. Duane Pfennigwerth Okay. And then the comments on Latin are really interesting, maybe you could help us put some context around Brazil. Could you remind us how much your capacity is down 3Q versus 2Q and what the shape of RASM you are expecting? So for example, we have heard some others that maybe long-haul international to Brazil went from like down 35 to down 25, which is sequential improvement, but its still pretty weak for you, your capacity cuts are much greater than that, so maybe revenues or maybe RASM is still sort of flattish. Any help you can give us there will be appreciated? Scott Kirby Yes, we have cut capacity  I dont know 3Q or just 2Q, we started cutting capacity in 2015 and we could see these results clearly deteriorating. We were surprised actually in 2015. I think, every carrier that flies from Brazil to the United States not only increased capacity, but increased capacity by double-digits, except for American Airlines. So, I think we are probably down 35% to 40% from where we were back in 14 today. But in the second quarter for the first time, we actually saw industry capacity come down. Its going to come down even more in the third and fourth quarter. And as a result, Brazil, which was running down kind of 35%, in the second quarter RASM was down 13%, in the third quarter, we expect it to be positive. Now, we are getting a boost in the third quarter from the Olympics. So, I wouldnt necessarily expect the fourth quarter to remain positive. Although our guess is right now that the fourth quarter will remain positive. There has just been an awful lot of capacity come out and you just got to such a low level, I mean, the RASM will still be down. I dont know the number, 40%, 50% from where it was at the peak even if it turns positive in the third and fourth quarter, but its certainly  it feels like its not getting worse anymore. Its not really on  its coming off a low base. Its not really on a rapid recovery, but it does feel like its not getting worse anymore. Duane Pfennigwerth Thank you for that. So, maybe RASM positive on capacity down double-digits for you? Scott Kirby I dont know what our capacity is right now. As I look at it on our overall longer time horizon, over a longer time horizon, we are down probably close to 40%, but I dont know what it is 3Q versus 2Q. Duane Pfennigwerth Okay, thank you for the detailed answers. Thank you. Appreciate it. Doug Parker Thanks. Operator Next, we will take Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Doug Parker Hi, Julie. Julie Yates Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Derek, one for you on the CapEx decline in 2017 and 2018 starts to free up some free cash flow, what are your priorities, are there additional opportunities to prepay debt, and is this meant to help with the pension funding requirement coming in 2019? Derek Kerr Yes, two things. One it will be we are going to use cash to complete the integration and continue to do all the projects that we are  we have got on the list as Scott talked about, basic economy, premium economy, cash will definitely go to that first. As we look at pension requirements, our first pension requirement payment is in 19. We have a small requirement in 18, but the biggest requirement is in 19. We do have the possibility to do that early on the pensions in 18 if we want to get 80% funded in the 18 timeframe. So, thats a possibility to do, but its not required to do our requirement is in 19 to do that. So, I think the biggest uses are going to be making sure that we have enough CapEx. We have $1.2 billion this year in CapEx. We expect that to maintain, if not grow a little bit in 17 and 18 just due to all the projects and the backup demand thats there for everybody. So, I think thats where we will more likely go than any early pension payments, the requirement and the pensions in 19. Julie Yates Okay, very helpful. And then Scott, one for you, from the last year, we have seen the weakness from competitive actions is really contained. How much do you worry about that when you observe whats going on in other markets with the other airlines that you mentioned? Scott Kirby Well, look, its a really competitive environment and its still a yield in RASM, negative environment across the board. So, we are impacted by that. I think we get better at competing in that environment. The more experience we get with it, we work  learn things that work, learn things that we can do better, but the biggest thing we can do really is the structural response. And I know on these calls we typically focused on whats going to happen in the next quarter or the next three weeks and have a pretty short-term focus on it. But the biggest thing we can do is get the product segmentation right, not just for investors, but for our customers, where we can give customers what they are looking for, whether they want a really cheap barebones low price or whether they want a product that has more amenities and is a higher quality product. And its taking us time to get that done, but thats really the right structural response. So, we feel pretty good about where we are. We think that we are on a continuing trajectory and we expected to have a positive trajectory to get back to positive PRASM that happened this quarter and we expect it happen in the second quarter and expect it in the third quarter. And we think we are going to continue on that trend. So, we wish it was PRASM was positive today. We wish we had a benign competitive environment, but we have what we have and we think we are making good progress. Derek Kerr And Julie, this is Derek. Just one follow-up to that question. From a debt  non-aircraft debt payments, next year, its only $100 million for us. Year after that, its only $600 million. We do have an unsecured bond in 18 and we will  if there is any opportunities to prepay any high cost debt, which we have done a significant amount of and we will do at any point we can, we will use that cash to prepay any of that. We dont have any planned in 17 and 18, but if we find things that we can prepay early, we will use any cash to do that in 17 and 18. Julie Yates Okay, great. And then, Scott Doug Parker Its only because we have a lot of our employees who listen into these calls and you mentioned that pension, I just want to make sure I explain to everybody kind of whats going on there. The issue is you may or may not be doing that Julie. I mean, we are fully funded per some airline pension funding rules and more funded in that regard than our competitors on the pensions. We, at American, are required because of the way these  because of the fact, frankly, the American didnt file a bankruptcy and Delta Northwest did or Delta United did, we are required to move off that funding plan and two other funding plans sooner than they are. And as Derek said, I think thats 18 or 19 for us. So, that will require us to move up to a higher level at that time. We could do it today if we wanted to. This is not a funding issue. It will never be a funding issue. Its just whats the right time to pay debt amortizations, and this is  so we will pay that when  we will fund at that as we are required to. We are fully funded now higher than our competitors and will be funded at a rate higher than them when we do this. But we dont think  none of us think its in the best interest of the company to go fund it in advance or to be over-funded on something that doesnt have a return. So we will keep doing until that we are well aware that its not an issue whatsoever and its fully manageable, it can be funded now. Julie Yates Okay. Thanks Doug. And then just one last one for you Scott, on corporate, its been a pretty big topic on some of the other calls and you guys havent mentioned it, what  can you give us an update on what trends you are seeing from a corporate perspective? Scott Kirby Well, they continue as they have been. We had corporate demand up and we continue to win share. I think corporate revenue was down 1% for us in the quarter, so obviously its outperforming the rest of the system. But I think its much like it has been. Corporate demand is strong, but we have a lot of low fares in the markets, so we are getting the deal right now. Julie Yates Got it. Thanks so much. Operator Our next question comes from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi Hi guys. Thanks for the time. Maybe I would like to follow-up on Jamies question Scott, with regard to some of the secular trends that were perhaps one of the thing you would called out, the growth of low cost carriers, but one of the things that I have been thinking a little bit harder about more recently is that we have also seen a lot of frequency acceleration here over the last few years and I am just wondering if maybe you thought perhaps, the quality of the schedule having deteriorated a bit could have also driven some of the decoupling that we have seen in that historical relationship between airline revenue and GDP and just any thoughts around that? Scott Kirby I dont think so. I mean one of the things that is a close analog to that probably is every airline has increased density on aircraft. And so we have done it, but all of our competitors have as well. And at least as with regard to RASM, that we typically think of those extra seats is coming in at 50% of system RASM. And so we put another 12 seats on the 737-800s that, that 12 seats is 6% of capacity, it means that all those flights come in, the RASM is 3% lower than it otherwise would have been, they are profit positive. But I think that is  that is probably a change that has driven lower RASM, at least across the industry, it has a corresponding benefit on the cost side of course, that would drive lower RASM. But we still have high quality schedules for business travelers. And I dont think business travelers are flying less because maybe you have 14 flights a day in a market instead of 15 flights a day, I dont think you are really losing any business. But people are resigned to stay home because of that. Darryl Genovesi Okay. And then you had also mentioned that you thought the Olympics were going to be a positive, down in Brazil, I remember 2 years ago when we had the World Cup down dont there, you saw some very close-in revenue deterioration, bookings deterioration, which I think was related to hotel availability, do you think that, thats likely going to be an issue again this time? Scott Kirby Well, usually, the Olympics, World Cups, conventions are a negative for revenues, because business travelers just stay away, because they cant get hotels and worry about the crowds and some business travel dries up. We have seen that in all other Olympics. We have seen that in the World Cup. In this case, Brazil is so bad that there is no business traffic or close to no business traffic. As of this year, I think there will be a positive just because Brazil has fallen so much before. 2 years ago, I would have thought the Olympics would be a negative and it would have been 2 years ago. But today, because things have fallen so much, they are going to actually be a positive. Darryl Genovesi Great. And then if I could squeeze one last one, I just like a point of clarification for Derek. Derek I think you said CapEx was coming down by $500 million in 17 and $700 million in 18, is that just aircraft CapEx or is that total CapEx and I think you said there was also an offset on the non-aircraft one? Derek Kerr Thats just aircraft CapEx. Right now, we are showing $1.2 billion in 16 for non-aircraft CapEx. We think it will go up to $1.5 billion in 17 and then probably $1.5 billion, I just put $1.5 billion for both 17 and 18 as we finish off and then will drop off in 19 and 20. So I am trying to get done with all the basic economy, premium economy, all of the interior work that we are doing and all of the completion of all the merger activity we will have higher non-aircraft CapEx in 17 and 18, but then get back to that $1.2 billion, $1 billion run rate in 19 and 20. Darryl Genovesi Would you just provide the total gross CapEx as you see it today for those years? Derek Kerr Yes. I have 5.6 in 16, 5.5 in 17, 3.6 in 18, 3.6 in 19 and 3.2 in 20. Darryl Genovesi Thank you. Operator Our next question is coming from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth Hi, good morning. Actually if I could first ask a follow-up to Julies question on the corporate demand, can you just talk about like what the volume trend has been over the last several quarters and if thats similar or have you seen maybe a deceleration in that trend? Scott Kirby I think they have been similar. Not a real change from the corporate demand environment. Savi Syth Alright, great. And then just switching to the kind of the non-fuel cost side, on the pre pre-agreed profit sharing basis, if I look at the full year guide, it seems that there is a lot of pressure here in 2016, I am just wondering whats driving that and when we might see some of the kind of the benefits from merger or integration related benefits benefiting the cost side and maybe just some early thoughts on what we might see from the headwinds and tailwinds in 2017? Scott Kirby Yes. I think whats driving this year is primarily for a full year effect, its salaries and benefits and adding back in the profit sharing. So that of a full year, we have guided right around 5, thats almost 4.5 of it. The third quarter change from the second quarter is really driven by maintenance timing. I think we had a 1.7% good guy in maintenance in the first quarter, 1% in the second quarter and its shifting almost exactly opposite in the third and fourth quarter with about a 1.6 headwind in the third and a 1.4 headwind in the fourth. So its really a shift in the maintenance timing. Year-over-year, our maintenance is flat, its up 0.1, so its virtually flat. But its the timing of things moving from this year in the third and fourth quarter more than last year being in the first and second quarter, so thats really the year-over-year timing. As we look forward, we dont  we still have one contract to do that is not in our guidance, that we are still working hard to get our mechanics in our RAMP contract done and we want to get that done as soon as possible. That would be the biggest headwind going into next year from a CASM perspective. Other than that, we believe we should be in the zero to 2% range going forward and we dont see any major CASM headwinds looking out into 17 or 18. Savi Syth If I may follow-up on that, from a gauge standpoint, whats the trend is there going to be, kind of maybe its a zero to 2% would rely on the gauge improvement? Derek Kerr Gauge improvements from an aircraft perspective? Savi Syth Exactly? Derek Kerr There is still some gauge increase. Some of that is going as we modify the aircraft, so maybe 0.5% of that will be gauge driven. Savi Syth Okay. And then just from kind of on the regional side, there is not a lot more left then, from kind of up-gauging there? Derek Kerr Correct. There is only from a delivery perspective, we only have about 12 aircraft of gauge coming in 17, so there will be some effect from the 16. We had 42 aircraft coming in 16, so there will be a little bit affect that next year. This year, we had a gauge difference of about, from an ASM perspective, of about 3.3. Next year, its probably about half of that, 1.5 points to 2 points on the regional perspective. Savi Syth Alright, great. Thank you. Operator Next, we will take the question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Derek and Scott, I just want to talk about kind of the capacity reductions you announced, I guess it was last week, one of your peers have said that its essentially too expensive for them to pull capacity starting in fourth quarter, so I just want to understand, when you guys ran the numbers on pulling ASMs, was it dilutive to earnings and you were just willing to accept that to try and regain some pricing power or was it not? Derek Kerr No, we think its the right thing to do. We think its earnings positive in that world. I mean look, in a world where RASM is declining and/or fuel prices were going up, it just becomes mathematically true that everything across your system gets a little worse. And so the bottom 1% has a higher probability that its no longer profitable. It is true that you cant get 100% of the cost out in the short-term that does drive CASM pressure for us, but we think that, that the capacity changes we made are both revenue and earnings positive beginning in the fourth quarter even though we cant get 100% of the cost out. Joseph DeNardi Okay, okay. And then Derek, you have talked in some detail about the CapEx and debt profile over the next couple of years, can you just talk about just on the interest expense line when and at what level that, that number peaks and then starts to come down over the next couple of years? Derek Kerr On the interest expense line? Joseph DeNardi Yes. Derek Kerr Let me see. Let me try to grab that for the 5-year plan. Go ahead and ask another one and I will pull that question and I will pull that answer. Doug Parker What else you got, Joe? Joseph DeNardi I was going to try and stick to two, so I will let somebody else get on. Doug Parker We are still long enough... Derek Kerr It should stay pretty stable where we have it right now. So, our interest expense line in 16 is forecast to be right about at $1 billion and we forecast it for the next. Depending on what we do, I think, right now, we expect to finance a fair amount of those aircraft, so if we do that, we will reduce that pretty much commensurate with what we bring on. So, our interest expense should stay pretty flat over the next 5 years under that methodology. And we have reduced the cost of the debt from 5% down almost to 4% debt, which is as we have refinanced and financed these aircraft at really attractive rates we have reduced our overall cost of debt down to around 4%. Joseph DeNardi Great, thank you very much. Doug Parker Thanks, Joseph. Operator Our next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here guys. I guess just to go back to the revenue initiatives and cabin segmentation for a moment, I know the plan is to have basic economy by the end of this year. But can you give us a sense for when you would expect those initiatives to really start having some noticeable improvement on the P&L in terms of your RASM or PRASM? Derek Kerr So basic economy, I think we will start to have an impact probably on March of next year what I would say. And then premium economy, while we will roll it out at some point in 17 because it will also be tied in  we are going to treat premium economy like a separate cabin essentially. So different than what other airlines might call premium economy today, more expansive, more what it looks like or more how its treated internationally or how we are going to treat it internationally as a separate cabin. And because of that, it will have impact on the frequent flyer program and so that will probably be for 2018 really because we need to tell our frequent flyers in advance how it impacts the frequent flyer program. Jack Atkins Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on that then, is there a way to sort of put some brackets around the value you would expect that to generate to your earnings stream over the course of the next, call it 3 to 5 years? Scott Kirby I am going to be disappointed if its not a $1 billion a year. Jack Atkins Okay, thank you very much. Doug Parker Thank you. Operator And now we will begin the media portion of the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Susan Carey with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. Susan Carey Good morning. Two probably for Scott. I think, Scott, at the outset, I understood you to say that your 3Q guidance is going to be for RASM, down 3.5% to 5.5% and I believe I understood you to say you were abandoning PRASM and you were going to be adopting the RASM model going forward. Am I getting that right? Scott Kirby Well, I didnt say abandon, but yes, thats right. Its the better metric to look at more an increasing percentage of our revenues come in the other revenue line. The credit card deal is obviously a big component of that. But also as we move into a world of basic economy and premium economy, there will be a higher amount of revenues that come in other revenues, and thats really the most important metric. So, we are going to be guiding to RASM on a going forward basis. Susan Carey And okay, so  and the other question I think an analyst asked it, you said there are  Brexit is not really going to have a big impact on you for the foreseeable future, except on the ForEx front, but I think the guy asked, what are you going to do about coordinating, with VA across the pond in case there has to be some kind of capacity adjustment? Is it premature to talk about that right now or is that something thats in your planning horizon? Scott Kirby Well look, we have a great relationship with IAG and we talk to them all the time about what the right amount of capacity is and will this continue in the normal course in that process and we will react as we see things happen in the market, but there is nothing specific to talk about today. Susan Carey Thank you. Doug Parker Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Jeffrey Dastin with Reuters. Jeffrey Dastin Hi, thank you for taking the question. Perhaps I missed this, but could you specify any markets or if there is particular region that will be impacted by the Airbus deferrals? Scott Kirby Well, we didnt specify and there really isnt, because we still have to work through the plans on where we are going to fly with the existing fleet. It  really, what this does is give us flexibility. All these aircraft were scheduled to be replacement aircraft for existing aircraft and so we can extend some of the leases longer to keep the existing flying and/or growth plans in place or given a weak international environment, we can keep some of those requirements in place as they were and pullback on what our growth plans otherwise would have been. So, it really just gives us flexibility. Jeffrey Dastin Great, thank you. And one follow-up question or unrelated question, how are bookings shaping up for cities in Cuba so far? Scott Kirby You know, I dont know. Jeffrey Dastin Right, thank you. Doug Parker We will get some of that back to you, Jeffrey. Jeffrey Dastin Great, thank you. Doug Parker Sure. Operator Next, we will take Edward Russell with Flightglobal. Edward Russell Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to understand why you are choosing to do the A350 deferrals now? You have the U.S. Airways and American order books back in 2013, so why the decision to do this now versus a year ago or so? Scott Kirby Well, in order to defer, you cant just unilaterally decide to defer aircraft and call Airbus or Boeing up and say, hey, we are going to defer aircraft and they say, okay. You have to work it out with them. And so we have just needed to find a point in time, where it was in Airbus best interest to defer the orders and ours. And so the timing is really about when it works for both sets of partners. Edward Russell Okay. I mean, one of the things that comes up I think of is I mean, Airbus has already started cutting metal for first half 17 deliveries at this point. So, I mean do you have any color on where you penalized for doing a deferral now or that it was just in the best interest? Scott Kirby No, this was something Airbus also wanted and so we were able to work out a win-win for Airbus and American and... Doug Parker Yes, hey, Edward, its Doug. I mean, look anyway, first off as you know, we came in with two realms of two large fleet orders and we have been trying to get them better coordinated this helps. And on the Airbus front, you should talk to them, but its been a very popular product as you know and they sold a lot of them and they are trying to meet all their customers needs and this deferral, I think, was consistent with that. Scott Kirby We did defer 4 787s last year, so... Doug Parker So, it worked out well for us and presumably worked out well for Airbus, but we did not  we certainly did not pay any penalties for it. Edward Russell Got it. Thank you very much. Operator And our next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein Hi, good morning. There has been some kind of dire forecast out of Europe, European airlines on the impact on travel demand from the terror incidents. Are you guys seeing anything or do you expect to see anything from that? Scott Kirby Well, we dont have anyway of knowing why bookings are lower or why revenue is weaker. Europe is the one area that is going to sequentially get worse in the third quarter than the second quarter. But whether its that or whether its the economic weakness or whether its Brexit or whether its just the currency impact or whether its all the capacity growth, there is a lot of things that could be driving it and its probably all of the above. Mary Schlangenstein Yes, thank you. Operator And our last question is coming from Ted Reed with The Street. Please go ahead. Ted Reed Thank you. Two quick things. First of all, first Delta said they were going to cut to UK by 6%, then United said incremental cuts, and now you are saying no cuts to UK. So whats the difference is just the traffic doing better than everybody thought? Scott Kirby Well, I dont think we said anything about what we are going to do in the UK. Ted Reed What are you going to do in the UK? Scott Kirby We havent said anything. Ted Reed Alright. And the other thing I wondered about is I was surprised  people were surprised when you put the 787-9 on to go to Madrid instead of to Asia, what was your thinking behind that? Scott Kirby Well, we have got a partner in Madrid with a hub there and we just thought it was the right route to come. There is going to be 78s, 9s that will be flying to Asia. We are taking a lot of deliveries and they will be coming, but starting it off, it worked for the aircraft rotation and worked flying into one of our partners hubs. Ted Reed Alright, thank you. Doug Parker Thanks Ted. Operator And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Doug Parker Alright. We have no additional closing remarks other than thank you and please let us know if you have any further questions. We appreciate your time.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks. Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today we're pleased to report third quarter results that reflect stronger customer demand and business performance than we anticipated just 90 days ago and include several encouraging signs. Revenue of $42.4 billion was near the high end of our guidance range and gross margin of 38% was at the top of our guidance range. We achieved these results while reducing channel inventory by about $3.6 billion, significantly more than the $2 billion inventory reduction we had expected. So our sell-through was markedly greater than our sell-in. iPhone accounted for the vast majority of the channel inventory reduction. iPhone unit sell-through was down just 8% year on year, an even greater improvement over the March quarter than we predicted, and we expect the September quarter sell-through comparison to improve further. We feel good about our channel inventory levels and believe they position us well for the months ahead. We had a very successful global launch of iPhone SE, and demand outstripped supply throughout the quarter. We brought on additional capacity and were able to achieve supply/demand balance as we entered the September quarter. At its launch, we said that the addition of the iPhone SE to the iPhone lineup placed us in a better position to meet the needs of customers who love a four-inch phone and to attract even more customers into our ecosystem. In both cases, that strategy is working. Our initial sales data tells us that the iPhone SE is popular in both developed and emerging markets, and the percentage of iPhone SE sales going to customers who are new to iPhone is greater than we've seen in the first weeks of availability for other iPhones launched in the last several years. Overall, we added millions of first-time smartphone buyers in the June quarter, and switchers accounted for the highest percentage of quarterly iPhone sales we've ever measured. In absolute terms, our year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we've seen in any nine-month period, and our active installed base of iPhones is up strong double-digits year over year. We saw tremendous performance from our Services businesses, which grew 19% to a June quarter record of $6 billion. The growth was broad-based, with App Store revenue up 37% to a new all-time high, in addition to strong increases in Music, iCloud, and AppleCare. In the last 12 months, our Services revenue is up almost $4 billion year on year to $23.1 billion, and we expect it to be the size of a Fortune 100 company next year. Most of our terrific Services performance during the quarter was fueled by our active installed base of devices, with installed base-related purchases of $10.3 billion accelerating to 29% growth year on year. We had our best iPad compare in 10 quarters, with revenue growing 7% thanks to the rollout of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. We're proud to have the most exciting lineup of tablets and accessories in the world and exceptionally high customer satisfaction and engagement. Our surveys also show that about half of iPad Pro purchases are buying them for work. iPad Pro is the ultimate upgrade for existing iPad users and the ultimate replacement device for customers switching from PC notebooks. Apple Watch continues to be the best-selling smartwatch in the world. And just this month, J.D. Power ranked it highest in customer satisfaction among all smartwatches. With watchOS 3 coming this fall, customers will be able to update their Apple Watches with an enhanced user interface, significantly improved performance and all-new fitness and health capabilities, including activity sharing. We're just getting started with the Apple Watch, and we look forward to even more exciting announcements in this space. On a personal note, during the past quarter I visited China and India, and I am very encouraged about our growth prospects in those countries. We remain very optimistic about the long-term opportunities in Greater China and we continue to invest there. We opened our 41st Greater China retail store during the quarter, and we also made a $1 billion investment in Didi Chuxing. Switchers and first-time smartphone buyers represented the lion's share of our iPhone sales in the quarter, and our installed base of iPhones in China has grown by 34% over the last year alone. According to China Mobile, there are more iPhones on their network than any other brand, with iPhone users ranking first in terms of customer loyalty, data usage and ARPU. By far, the largest portion of our global channel inventory reduction was in Greater China, so our underlying business there is stronger than our results imply. We face some challenges in Greater China, as the economic environment has slowed down since the beginning of the year. This is reflected in consumer confidence and retail spending, and the Chinese yuan has depreciated by 7% relative to the U.S. dollar since August of last year. Hong Kong's tourism and retail businesses also continue to be significantly impacted by the stronger Hong Kong dollar relative to other Asian currencies. Combining this backdrop with the tough comparison to last year, when revenue grew 112%, and the channel inventory reduction this year, we're reporting a decline in revenue in the June quarter. But to keep things in perspective, when we look back on our accomplishments in this segment over the last couple of years, they are truly remarkable. In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our total revenue from Greater China was almost $40 billion, up 55% from the same timeframe just two years ago, while iPhone units were up 47%. India is now one of our fastest growing markets. In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our iPhone sales in India were up 51% year on year. We just announced a first of its kind design and development accelerator to support Indian developers creating innovative applications for iOS, and we opened a new office in Hyderabad to accelerate maps development. We're looking forward to opening retail stores in India down the road, and we see huge potential for that vibrant country. As we look forward to the fall, we are thrilled by customers' response to the software and services we previewed at our Worldwide Developers Conference last month. This was our biggest WWDC ever. And for the first time, we have four innovative Apple platforms for our developers' apps, iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. In fact, iOS 10 will be the biggest release ever for iOS. The momentum of all four platforms shows the strong relationship Apple enjoys with customers throughout their day and wherever they go, whether it's at home, in their car, at work, or everywhere in between. The Apple ecosystem is thriving and growing, and our new OS releases this fall will take these great experiences to a new level. Customers can look forward to more expressive ways to communicate with messages now with its own App Store, allowing users to create and share content, make payments, add stickers and more, all without leaving messages, which is now one of the largest messaging services in the world. Customers can also look forward to a broader and more intelligent role for Siri, which will work with your favorite apps from the App Store, so you can ask Siri to book a ride with your favorite ride sharing app or send money to someone with Square. There are also beautifully redesigned apps for music, maps and news, significant enhancements to HomeKit, CarPlay, and the Health app, building on our strategy to give users a seamless experience in all aspects of their lives. There's also a major update with macOS Sierra, with new features like Siri and Apple Pay that make the Mac smarter and more helpful than ever, and even stronger continuity features across all the Apple devices. These experiences become more powerful and intuitive as we continue our long history of enriching our products through advanced artificial intelligence. We have focused our AI efforts on the features that best enhance the customer experience. For example, machine learning enables Siri to understand words as well as the intent behind them. That means Siri does a better job understanding and even predicting what you want, then delivering the right responses to requests. To make Siri an even smarter assistant, we're opening the service to developers, and this fall Siri will be available across our entire product line. We're also using machine learning in many other ways across our products and services, including recommending songs, apps, and news. Machine learning is improving facial and image recognition in photos, predicting word choice while typing in messages and mail, and providing context awareness in maps for better directions. Deep learning within our products even enables them to recognize usage patterns and improve their own battery life. And most importantly, we deliver these intelligent services while protecting users' privacy. Most of the AI processing takes place on the device rather than being sent to the cloud. And starting this fall, we'll be using sophisticated technology called differential privacy, enhancing our ability to deliver the kinds of services we dream of and customers love without compromising on the individual privacy our customers have come to expect from us. This fall we'll also bring Apple Pay to Safari so users can easily make secure and private purchases when shopping on participating websites. Tens of millions of users around the world are enjoying Apple Pay today at stores and in app, with estimated monthly active users up more than 450% year on year last month. Leading financial partners tell us that three out of four contactless payments in the U.S. are made with Apple Pay. This is amazing. There are more than 11 million contactless-ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay is available today, including 3 million locations now accepting Apple Pay in the United States. With the launch of France, Switzerland, and Hong Kong this month, Apple Pay is now live in nine markets, including six of our top 10. Adoption outside the U.S. has been explosive, with over half of transaction volume now coming from non-U.S. markets. With our latest OS releases, the unparalleled continuity across Apple devices will become even more powerful. For example, macOS Sierra will sense other devices and use secure protocols to communicate. With an authenticated Apple Watch, I can auto-unlock my Mac when I open it without typing a password. With Universal Clipboard, I can copy and paste text, images, and even video between my iOS devices and my Mac. And I can automatically access the files on my Mac desktop and documents folder from another Mac, iOS device, or even a PC. Innovations like these are the kinds of things that only Apple can do. We have an incredible lineup of products in our pipeline, and I'm very bullish about our long-term opportunity. Now I'd like to hand it over to Luca to share more details with you on the June quarter. Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the June quarter was $42.4 billion, near the high end of our guidance range, compared to $49.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. Customer demand for our products and services was stronger than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. As Tim mentioned, we reduced overall channel inventories by roughly $3.6 billion. On a geographic basis, our revenue grew strongly in Japan to a new June quarter record, and we experienced healthy growth in a number of other important markets, including Russia, Brazil, Turkey, India, and Canada. Gross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range. Operating margin was 23.9% of revenue, and net income was $7.8 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.42, and cash flow from operations was strong at $10.6 billion. For details by product, I will start with the iPhone. We sold 40.4 million iPhones in the quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by over 4 million units compared to about 0.5 million units a year ago, so sell-through was down by 8%. We exited the quarter near the low end of our five-week to seven-week target range for channel inventory. The rollout of our new entry-level iPhone SE concurrent with the channel reduction of more than 4 million higher-end iPhones resulted in a lower than usual iPhone ASP of $595. Therefore, we expect ASPs to improve this quarter. We experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets, with sales in Russia more than doubling year over year, and double-digit growth in many other key countries, including Japan, Turkey, Brazil, India, Canada, and Sweden. iPhone continues to show great momentum in business markets. A recent survey by 451 Research found that among U.S. corporate buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPhones. This is the highest corporate purchase intent ever measured by the survey for the September quarter. Turning to Services, we generated $6 billion in revenue, an increase of 19% over the June quarter last year. We set a new record for customers transacting on our iTunes Stores. And among our customers who purchase apps and content, the average amount spent per customer was the highest that we've ever measured. The App Store's growth rate has now accelerated for four consecutive quarters, reaching 37% in Q3. The App Store is overwhelmingly the preferred destination for both customers and developers. According to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the June quarter, widening our lead from the March quarter. Because of this continued growth, for the first nine months of our fiscal year, Services increased from 8% of our total revenue a year ago to 11% this year, and it represents an even higher percentage of our profitability. Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.3 million Macs compared to 4.8 million last year. It was a challenging quarter for personal computer sales across the industry, with IDC estimating a 4% global contraction. In addition to the overall market slowdown, we faced a very difficult compare to the year-ago quarter, when we introduced a new MacBook Pro and a new iMac. Despite these challenges, Mac continues to gain a high percentage of new customers, and our Mac installed base has grown to a new all-time high at the end of the June quarter. We ended the quarter below our four-week to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory. Now turning to iPad, revenue grew 7%. iPad ASP was $490 compared to $415 in the year-ago quarter, with the increase driven by iPad Pro, and we sold 10 million iPads compared to 10.9 million in the year-ago quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by about 500,000 units and exited the quarter within our five-week to seven-week target range. In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the overall U.S. tablet market in the June quarter and has 84% share of tablets priced above $200. And in May, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini and a 95% rate for iPad Air. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 63% plan to purchase an iPad, almost four times the purchase intention rate of the next highest brand measured, with iPad Pro the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers report a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 71% for the September quarter. One recent example of iPad business adoption is Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, which is adding 22,000 iPads to more than 10,000 purchased last year to deploy corporate mobility solutions across the organization and enable its consultants to serve customers in a more engaging and more efficient way. More broadly, we're making great progress with our enterprise initiatives and we see strong growth opportunities ahead of us. In May, we announced a global strategic partnership with SAP to reimagine business processes with native iOS apps. SAP is the world's largest enterprise software provider, with more than 130 million potential users among its 300,000 global customers. In fact, it's estimated that 76% of global business transactions touch an SAP system. Our partnership will deliver an SDK to fast-track iOS projects for SAP environments, an iOS academy to enable the 2.5 million SAP developers around the world to build great native iOS apps, and a portfolio of industry-specific apps to accelerate mobile transformation in the enterprise. Last month, we announced the first three solutions from our Cisco partnership, two that will dramatically improve the network performance of iOS traffic running on Cisco networks, and one that will bring the desk phone to the 21st century by integrating iPhone Wi-Fi calling into Cisco Spark. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $231.5 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential decrease of $1.4 billion. $214.8 billion of this cash, or 93% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued a total $2.4 billion of debt in Taiwan and in Australia, while retiring $2.5 billion in U.S. debt, leaving us with $72 billion in term debt at the end of the quarter, essentially unchanged from last quarter. We returned a total of over $13 billion to investors during the June quarter as follows. We paid $3.2 billion in dividends and equivalent. We spent $4 billion on repurchases of 41.2 million Apple shares through open-market transactions. And we launched a new $6 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 48.2 million shares. We also completed our sixth accelerated share repurchase program, retiring an additional 8.7 million shares. We've now completed almost $177 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program, including $127 billion in share repurchases. During the quarter, we also spent $1 billion on a minority investment in Didi Chuxing in China, completed three acquisitions and incurred $4.2 billion in capital expenditures. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $45.5 billion and $47.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.050 billion and $6.150 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $350 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock, payable on August 11, 2016 to shareholders of record as of August 8, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions. Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Your first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Thank you very much for the question. Tim, can you talk a little bit about your thoughts on investments? You made the Didi investment this quarter. Obviously, you continue to make acquisitions over time. We just saw I guess you invested in buying some of Carpool Karaoke. I'm just curious as to how you're thinking about where you're putting your investment dollars for more of an acquisition or a potential equity stake standpoint as you look at overall capital allocation. Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director Shannon, we obviously invest a ton of capital in our business itself to support research and development and the production of our products. And that's the main source of our capital. However, we're constantly looking on the outside for great talent and great intellectual property. And we have been buying companies on average every three to four weeks or so, and we continue to do that. And we think we've made some really great choices there. In terms of the investment in Didi, it was an unusual investment in that, as you know, we don't have a long history of doing a lot of these, but we have done some before. We invested in ARM in the early days. We invested in Akamai and a few other companies. So it wasn't the first. From a Didi point of view, we see that as, one, a great financial investment. Two, we think that there are some strategic things that the companies can do together over time. And three, we think that we'll learn a lot about the business and the Chinese market even beyond what we currently know, and Didi has an incredible team there. And so that's the rationale for why we did that. Would we do more investments? Yes, but it's not something that you'll see a whole string of from us. But we will constantly look for things that are smart to do. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Great. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up for Luca. If you could, talk a little bit about the gross margin puts and takes for guidance, 37% to 38%. How are you thinking about commodity pricing and mix of the new products and that just as you look to how you guided gross margin? Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Yes, Shannon. Let me correct you. It's 37.5% to 38%... Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Sorry. I had that written down, but I said the wrong thing. Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President ...for the September quarter. So essentially, we're guiding GM flat to slightly down sequentially. On the positive side, we're going to have leverage because we are guiding to a sequential increase in revenue, and we expect to have positive mix as we get into the September quarter, and these positives being offset more or less by what we call product transition costs, which are typical at this time of the year for us. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Great. Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director Shannon, on the commodity side and for the September quarter, we see NAND being pretty much in balance while DRAM and LCDs and other major commodities remain in an oversupply situation. And so overall commodity prices we expect to decline at at-least historical rates. Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From UBS, we'll hear from Steve Milunovich. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Great, thank you very much. Regarding your revenue guidance for September, it's up about 10% sequentially, which is clearly at the high end historically. So what can you tell us about the timing of the new iPhone model? Is that affecting this? You mentioned that 451 Research is finding business interest in phones, but their survey on consumers actually finds the lowest level of expectation for purchases in the next three months since 2008. You've seen the upgrade numbers from the carriers are quite low. So it seems like it's still a very tough demand environment. So where is the strength coming from in the September quarter? Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director Steve, we're not going to get into products or product transition. However, we've taken what we've learned from last quarter, and we did see a number of encouraging signs. Luca talked about the number of countries that we saw double-digit growth in during the quarter, from Japan to Brazil to India, some even stronger numbers than that in Russia. So there's a number of countries that we saw strong signals from that perspective. We also are very happy with the switcher rate that we saw, our highest ever recorded. And the number of switchers through the nine months are the highest absolute numbers that we've ever had. And so when we look at that and then we look at the things going on, on our other products and services, and we think Services will continue to grow very briskly. We've made our best estimate of where we think we'll come in, and that's $45.5 billion to $47.5 billion. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Okay, fair enough. And as a follow-up, I wanted to ask you about your platform strategy. You talk about the four operating systems essentially as platforms, which I agree with. And it's just interesting to me because Apple has such a control over the vertical integration of your products, and yet you've somehow been able to grasp the openness that's required for platforms. And I think that's reflected in WWDC, as you pointed out, opening up APIs and so forth on messaging. And you made the case there for apps versus messaging and the anti-bot argument. I'm just curious. Is that the way  am I characterizing this roughly correctly in terms about how you think about the business? And how are you managing that internally in terms of having this vertically integrated somewhat closed view of the hardware and yet this pretty open platform where the value is created externally? Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director We think to have a great platform you have to have a really healthy ecosystem. And so we're really proud of the developer community and the fact that developers are earning a lot more money in writing for iOS than other apps. We think that the best experience for users include apps, and so we want to do everything that we can do to continue building that. We now have over 2 million apps in the App Store and are more focused these days on discovery and other things to bring more great apps to the service because there are so many out there. And so that's what we're doing. The TV, and you didn't mention CarPlay, but these are trying to provide our users a seamless experience across all the different things that they do in their lives. And so that's the rationale for CarPlay. It's the rationale for why we're putting a huge investment in the home, making  really bringing home automation to life for people in a very simple and elegant way. It's the reason for Apple TV and what we're doing in the living room. And so all these things, all these things together are all about the user experience and making people's daily lives better. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury Thank you, Steve. Could we have the next question please? Operator We'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. Luca, as it relates to gross margin, the guidance today is very similar to what you've provided over the last five years in terms of gross margin guidance in September versus June. And the variances that you walked through in response to Shannon's questions are very similar to the dynamics that you see in any September quarter. But there's an added factor this time around, which is you don't have the 4 million units of high-ASP, high-margin inventory drain in September like you did in the June quarter. So I guess I'd just push back and ask why gross margin guidance wouldn't be even better? Is it the more balanced NAND environment that Tim spoke to, or is there something else impacting the guidance? Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Katy, I've talked about these elements at a broad level. Of course, there are degrees of positive impact. We for example on the mix front, every cycle is slightly different on our product mix, and so that clearly has an impact on gross margins. And the other thing that we need to keep in mind as we step back for a second and now we've gone through a couple of cycles where the U.S. dollar has strengthened. And as you know, we work with our hedging program where we get protection from FX fluctuations in the short term. When these hedges roll off over time, we end up replacing them with new hedging contracts at spot rates. And so versus September of 2014, for example, the U.S. dollar has now strengthened on average against international currencies by about 15%. And I think we need to accept that now we're living in this stronger U.S. dollar environment. We've taken a lot of actions on the cost side, on the pricing side, and obviously with hedges. But we need to deal with this situation, and that's where we are right now. We feel that 37.5% to 38% given the new FX environment I think says a lot about all the work that we've done on the cost side to get there. Just to give you a sense, on a year-over-year basis, when I look at foreign exchange, that has an impact of almost 300 basis points on our margins. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay, thank you. And, Tim, can you speak to how you envision the upgrade rate of the iPhone installed base to play out over the next quarter or the next year? Somebody mentioned that U.S. carriers have reported really weak upgrade rates, not necessarily for iPhone, but across their installed base. The press is discussing only modest technology upgrades in your next iPhone cycle. And so those data points would lead investors to believe that the upgrade rate will be low, but curious if you have a different view. Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director I don't want to talk about phones that aren't announced. And so that aside, what we have seen in the past tense or current tense on the upgrade rate is that the iPhone upgrade rate for the iPhone 6S is very similar to the iPhone 5S. And I guess in retrospect, maybe that was a predictable thing, although we didn't predict it in the beginning. It took us a little time to realize that. The iPhone 6 was significantly higher than that, and so it likely accelerated upgrades that would have been in the current year ahead of those. And so what the future holds, we'll see. But I'm very optimistic about the future because I see so many signs that are positive. I see an installed base that has gotten incredibly large. I see a switcher rate that is the highest ever. I see the smartphone itself, led by iPhone, becoming even more instrumental and important to people's lives. It's becoming essential. And all of the things that are coming both in the fall, the things that we've announced that you can see with iOS 10, hopefully you're running by now with the beta, those and other things make it even more instrumental. And AI even makes it even more and more. As the phone becomes more and more your assistant, it's one of those that you're not going to leave without it. And so I see all of those things as vectors that are incredibly positive. I also really like what I've seen with the iPhone SE and the fact that it's opening the door to customers that we weren't reaching before and likely convincing some people to upgrade that wanted a smaller form factor but wanted to stay with iPhone, and so they were waiting for the iPhone SE. And so I see lots of positive things, and so that's how I look at it. Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question please? Operator We'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi - Bernstein Research Yes, thank you. You commented about the significant inventory drawdown in the quarter, $3.6 billion on the revenue side. So sell-through was $46 billion effectively, over 4 million iPhones, suggesting that sell-through iPhone sales were 45 million. When I look to your guidance for Q4, I actually have the opposite question of a previous question, which is in light of the true sell-through rate, which seems to reflect better than normal seasonality in Q3, likely some contribution and elasticity from the SE, when I look at Q4, it looks like you're guiding for iPhone unit on a sell-through basis to be flat or potentially down and for total company revenues to be only fractionally up and below the seasonality we see in Q4. So I guess my question is, are you expecting any drawdowns in channel inventory in fiscal Q4? Are my inferences around sell-through rate incorrect? Or given the business momentum that you spoke about in response to an earlier question and the hopefulness that you expressed in your prepared remarks, Tim, I'm actually surprised that the guidance isn't a bit stronger on the top line. Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Toni, let me take it. Starting with your comments on the June quarter, I just want to point out that when we talk about a $3.6 billion channel inventory reduction, that is not entirely related to iPhone. iPhone is the vast majority of that, but we did reduce channel inventory on all other products as well. So that probably leads you to different conclusions to the math that you have just expressed. On the September quarter, when I look at the sequential increase for iPhone units that we are expecting, I would say that it is, even with the sell-through adjustments that you've talked about, it's still pretty much in line with what we've seen in the past. As you know, we do not provide guidance for channel inventory. But I would say, in general, I think it's important to keep in mind that if we look around the world, we do see a lot of positive signs, but we also know that the macroeconomic environment is slowing down in a number of places around the world. And that needs to be taken into account in our guidance. Toni Sacconaghi - Bernstein Research Okay. Luca, I did understand the $3.6 billion, but you said over 4 million iPhones were drawn down. I added that to the 40.4 million, so that would suggest close to 45 million on a sell-through basis. So that was the basis for my observation. I was wondering if I could direct one at Tim. You talked about the upgrade cycle and how it elongated relative to the iPhone 6 and that it's similar to what you saw with the iPhone 5S. And my belief is that one of the bigger longer-term concerns for Apple is that the replacement cycle could just structurally elongate over time, particularly as your installed base of customers becomes less affluent and more international. So I guess my question is, you have a mechanism, which is the Apple Upgrade Program, which takes replacement cycle out of the equation and puts people on buying the phone as a service. And so I'd welcome any comments on how that program is doing. And then just more broadly, is Apple thinking about ways to sell not only the iPhone, but more of its products on a monthly type subscription basis, perhaps in a more bundled fashion so that you can add more predictability to what is now largely a transactional revenue model? Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director The iPhone demand is made up, as you know, of upgraders, switchers and new to smartphone. And so if you take it in reverse order for a minute and look at a new smartphone, smartphone penetration right now around the world at the end of December was 42%. And so there's quite a bit of room there. It is true that a lot of those are in emerging markets, but we have done  we've had reasonable business success in several emerging markets. And so we don't enter into those with no experience, although we will enter into them humbly. On the switcher side, we really like what we're seeing. And we think that from a user point of view, as the smartphone itself becomes more and more essential to people's daily lives, which is a part of what I had talked about before, a part of bringing it into the home in a bigger way and in the car and at work and so forth, we think people will put more and more focus on what they're buying and the thing that Apple does best, which is provide this killer experience. A killer user experience that's integrated across their lives I think becomes more important and I think that really plays to our advantage. I also think that the deployment of AI technology is something that we will excel at because of our focus on user experience, and so I like that. From an upgrade point of view, there are pluses and minuses as I see it. A plus is that more and more people have already joined upgrade programs. Some of these programs, like the one that you referenced that we've done, replaces the iPhone every year. There are also carriers that have similar kind of plans, where they also replace or change out the iPhone every year. Others have an 18-month clock. Some have a 24-month clock, and there are even some that have a 30-month clock. And so there's various time schedules there. And so, as of today, there are obviously a lot more people on those programs than ever before because they just started. It really got underway in a big way last year, in a smaller way two years ago. And so we'll see more of those this coming fall. The minus side is that the bifurcation of the smartphone from the service itself has a plus and a minus into it. The subsidy, the lack of that  and this is more of a U.S. phenomenon than the rest of the world, some of that can be a shock for people that were used to paying $199 for their smartphone. They come back in and they pay less for the service but they pay more for their smartphone. And so there's lots of pluses and minuses on this. But overall, as I look at this for Apple, and this is not a statement on the industry itself, but for Apple, I'm very optimistic. Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From Goldman Sachs, Simona Jankowski. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Tim, as you mentioned, you traveled to China during the quarter. And while you certainly sound encouraged on China and highlighted the Didi investment, there are some of the key services for Apple like iBooks and iTunes Movies that are still banned, and some of the local vendors appear to be gaining share. So can you just give us your perspective on the market, your expectations around getting those services back up, and also regaining share? Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director Yes, for books and movies, we currently have those stores off, as you mentioned. To put this in some context, those two stores for the months that we had them operational, which was several months, the revenue was less than $1 million. And so it's not a revenue-related issue. From our point of view, this is a service we want to provide our customers. And so we're working very closely with the appropriate government agencies, and we hope to make books and movies available again to our customers there. And so we'll see how that goes, but we're optimistic there. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. And in terms of just regaining share in that market more broadly? Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director I think we've always had  if you look at our share over time, our share in China tends to peak during launch windows. There's a higher high and a lower low there. There's a bigger difference between those two. And so what we have to do and what we're doing is innovating like crazy and delivering the best smartphone to our customers there. And if we do a really great job of that, which we will, then I'm confident that we'll do well. Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please? Operator Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co. Good afternoon. Tim, you gave some nice data points around Apple Pay. Can you remind us? Is this a business that ultimately impacts the Services line in any measurable way, or is Apple Pay generally about selling iPhones? And separately, when you just take a step back and look at the proof point that the augmented reality [AR] theme has had with this whole Pokémon phenomenon, how does it impact how you think about the future? I assume you think about it. I'm just curious what goes on in your mind when you see all that. Thanks. Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director On the Apple Pay side, the revenues from Apple Pay are in the Services line. The growth is astronomical, but the base is very small. And so for today, Apple Pay is very much about a great feature for our customers so that they can pay in a very simple, private, and secure way. In terms of AR and the Pokémon phenomenon, it's incredible what has happened there. I think it's a testament to what happens with innovative apps and the whole ecosystem and the power of being a developer being able to press a button, so to speak, and offer their product around the world. And just a certain developer has elected not to go worldwide yet because of the pressure on their servers, et cetera, because of the demand. But I'm sure that they will over time. It also does show, as you point out, that AR can be really great. And we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity. And so we're investing, and the number one thing is to make sure our products work well with other developers' products like Pokémon. And so that's the reason why you see so many iPhones out in the wild right now chasing Pokémons. Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co. Would you say there's going to be a computing shift to AR longer term? Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director I notice there are people that want to call it a new computer platform, and we'll see. I think there's a tendency in this industry to call everything new the next computer platform. However, that said, I think AR can be huge. So we'll see whether it's the next platform. But regardless, it will be huge. Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury Thanks, Gene. Can we have the next question, please? Operator We'll go to Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc. Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. I just want to follow up, Tim, if I could, related to the R&D pace of growth, clearly a lot of momentum there over the last couple years. But we're just trying to figure out how much of that is dedicated to existing products and services versus what's next? Can you give us a sense in terms of when investors should think about the ROI coming back to them from the R&D perspective? And a corollary to that, is it really restricted just to products and services currently, or can we see more of a cloud services apparatus evolve over time where you do more and more in the enterprise just given the core trips with SAP and Cisco and IBM? And then my follow-up for Luca is around ASPs for the iPhone. We keep getting a lot of questions around iPhone SE in terms of how cannibalistic could it be to the core iPhone franchise. Are you seeing any moderation in terms of the ASP pressures here? Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director On R&D growth, we do continue to invest significantly in R&D. The growth rates are still large on a year-over-year basis, and Luca can share the exact ones. But I think the recent quarter was in the mid-20% for R&D. The balance of the company we're managing more flattish from a year-over-year point of view. The products that are in R&D, there is quite a bit of investment in there for products and services that are not currently shipping or derivations of what is currently shipping. And so I don't want to talk about the exact split of it. But you can look at the growth rate and conclude that there's a lot of stuff that we're doing beyond the current products. Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Mark, on the ASP question, I talked about the $595 in Q3. It's down $65 on a year-over-year basis. Keep in mind, about $20 of that $65 is foreign exchange. So during the quarter, we had this combination of starting with no iPhone SE units in channel inventory, so we had to do an at least a partial channel fill that obviously had an impact on ASPs. And then the other element was the fact that we've reduced more than 4 million units of channel inventory on the high end. So the combination of these two things obviously had an impact on ASPs. But I think as I said or Tim said during the prepared remarks, we do expect iPhone ASP to improve sequentially as we move into the September quarter because these two factors that I just mentioned are not going to repeat. On cannibalization, of course we've got limited experience because the phone has been in the market just for a few weeks. But when we look at our survey data on iPhone SE, as Tim was saying, we believe that the iPhone SE is doing exactly what it was intended, which is we are seeing a higher rate of new to iPhone customers, which is obviously very important to us because we bring new people into the iOS ecosystem. And we see a higher rate of previous iPhone owners that really prefer the four-inch form factor. We have not seen clear evidence of cannibalization from iPhone 6S or iPhone 6S Plus. Of course, there's always going to be some level of cannibalization. But really to us what is much more relevant is the much bigger opportunity to bring more people into the iOS ecosystem. Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury Thanks, Mark. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From Credit Suisse, we'll hear from Kulbinder Garcha. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Thanks, just a couple questions for me. Luca, I just want to clarify that last point on ASPs on iPhone because last quarter it seemed that you were quite clear that that was a negative driver to the gross margin of the company. So I understand there are other drivers going into the September quarter. But just to be clear, the phone units you didn't sell through that were depleted in channel inventory, those are relatively high gross margin as well. That's the clarification. And then for Tim, on the Services side, as Apple has spoken more and more loudly I guess in the last three or four quarters, I just think about some of the comments you've made about the TV market and how it's been stuck I think in the 1960s and the 1970s and the experience hasn't changed. I understand you've got the Apple TV box out. But in terms of driving actual video-on-demand services, is that something that Apple wants to do themselves? Do you want a partner? Could you even build content? How do you think about that as an actual business opportunity as opposed to here's an Apple box and we sell some units, but it's not that meaningful to the overall company in terms of size? I'm just curious given the installed base and users you have. Thanks. Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Kulbinder, on your question on iPhone ASP, I'm not sure if I understood it correctly. But clearly the iPhone SE has a downward impact on iPhone ASP, of course, because it comes at the low end of the range. From a gross margin perspective, it is slightly dilutive to company margins, but the impact is not particularly large. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Okay, okay. Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director On the Apple TV question, the introduction of Apple TV and tvOS last October and the subsequent OS releases and what's coming out this fall, think of that as building the foundation for what we believe can be a broader business over time. And so I don't want to be more precise than that. But you shouldn't look at what's there today and think we've done what we want to do. We've built a foundation that we can do something bigger off of. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Okay, thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director Thank you for the question. Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury Thank you, Kulbinder.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator Your first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Thank you very much for the question. Tim, can you talk a little bit about your thoughts on investments? You made the Didi investment this quarter. Obviously, you continue to make acquisitions over time. We just saw I guess you invested in buying some of Carpool Karaoke. I'm just curious as to how you're thinking about where you're putting your investment dollars for more of an acquisition or a potential equity stake standpoint as you look at overall capital allocation. Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director Shannon, we obviously invest a ton of capital in our business itself to support research and development and the production of our products. And that's the main source of our capital. However, we're constantly looking on the outside for great talent and great intellectual property. And we have been buying companies on average every three to four weeks or so, and we continue to do that. And we think we've made some really great choices there. In terms of the investment in Didi, it was an unusual investment in that, as you know, we don't have a long history of doing a lot of these, but we have done some before. We invested in ARM in the early days. We invested in Akamai and a few other companies. So it wasn't the first. From a Didi point of view, we see that as, one, a great financial investment. Two, we think that there are some strategic things that the companies can do together over time. And three, we think that we'll learn a lot about the business and the Chinese market even beyond what we currently know, and Didi has an incredible team there. And so that's the rationale for why we did that. Would we do more investments? Yes, but it's not something that you'll see a whole string of from us. But we will constantly look for things that are smart to do. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Great. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up for Luca. If you could, talk a little bit about the gross margin puts and takes for guidance, 37% to 38%. How are you thinking about commodity pricing and mix of the new products and that just as you look to how you guided gross margin? Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Yes, Shannon. Let me correct you. It's 37.5% to 38%... Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Sorry. I had that written down, but I said the wrong thing. Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President ...for the September quarter. So essentially, we're guiding GM flat to slightly down sequentially. On the positive side, we're going to have leverage because we are guiding to a sequential increase in revenue, and we expect to have positive mix as we get into the September quarter, and these positives being offset more or less by what we call product transition costs, which are typical at this time of the year for us. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Great. Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director Shannon, on the commodity side and for the September quarter, we see NAND being pretty much in balance while DRAM and LCDs and other major commodities remain in an oversupply situation. And so overall commodity prices we expect to decline at at-least historical rates. Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From UBS, we'll hear from Steve Milunovich. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Great, thank you very much. Regarding your revenue guidance for September, it's up about 10% sequentially, which is clearly at the high end historically. So what can you tell us about the timing of the new iPhone model? Is that affecting this? You mentioned that 451 Research is finding business interest in phones, but their survey on consumers actually finds the lowest level of expectation for purchases in the next three months since 2008. You've seen the upgrade numbers from the carriers are quite low. So it seems like it's still a very tough demand environment. So where is the strength coming from in the September quarter? Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director Steve, we're not going to get into products or product transition. However, we've taken what we've learned from last quarter, and we did see a number of encouraging signs. Luca talked about the number of countries that we saw double-digit growth in during the quarter, from Japan to Brazil to India, some even stronger numbers than that in Russia. So there's a number of countries that we saw strong signals from that perspective. We also are very happy with the switcher rate that we saw, our highest ever recorded. And the number of switchers through the nine months are the highest absolute numbers that we've ever had. And so when we look at that and then we look at the things going on, on our other products and services, and we think Services will continue to grow very briskly. We've made our best estimate of where we think we'll come in, and that's $45.5 billion to $47.5 billion. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Okay, fair enough. And as a follow-up, I wanted to ask you about your platform strategy. You talk about the four operating systems essentially as platforms, which I agree with. And it's just interesting to me because Apple has such a control over the vertical integration of your products, and yet you've somehow been able to grasp the openness that's required for platforms. And I think that's reflected in WWDC, as you pointed out, opening up APIs and so forth on messaging. And you made the case there for apps versus messaging and the anti-bot argument. I'm just curious. Is that the way  am I characterizing this roughly correctly in terms about how you think about the business? And how are you managing that internally in terms of having this vertically integrated somewhat closed view of the hardware and yet this pretty open platform where the value is created externally? Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director We think to have a great platform you have to have a really healthy ecosystem. And so we're really proud of the developer community and the fact that developers are earning a lot more money in writing for iOS than other apps. We think that the best experience for users include apps, and so we want to do everything that we can do to continue building that. We now have over 2 million apps in the App Store and are more focused these days on discovery and other things to bring more great apps to the service because there are so many out there. And so that's what we're doing. The TV, and you didn't mention CarPlay, but these are trying to provide our users a seamless experience across all the different things that they do in their lives. And so that's the rationale for CarPlay. It's the rationale for why we're putting a huge investment in the home, making  really bringing home automation to life for people in a very simple and elegant way. It's the reason for Apple TV and what we're doing in the living room. And so all these things, all these things together are all about the user experience and making people's daily lives better. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury Thank you, Steve. Could we have the next question please? Operator We'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. Luca, as it relates to gross margin, the guidance today is very similar to what you've provided over the last five years in terms of gross margin guidance in September versus June. And the variances that you walked through in response to Shannon's questions are very similar to the dynamics that you see in any September quarter. But there's an added factor this time around, which is you don't have the 4 million units of high-ASP, high-margin inventory drain in September like you did in the June quarter. So I guess I'd just push back and ask why gross margin guidance wouldn't be even better? Is it the more balanced NAND environment that Tim spoke to, or is there something else impacting the guidance? Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Katy, I've talked about these elements at a broad level. Of course, there are degrees of positive impact. We for example on the mix front, every cycle is slightly different on our product mix, and so that clearly has an impact on gross margins. And the other thing that we need to keep in mind as we step back for a second and now we've gone through a couple of cycles where the U.S. dollar has strengthened. And as you know, we work with our hedging program where we get protection from FX fluctuations in the short term. When these hedges roll off over time, we end up replacing them with new hedging contracts at spot rates. And so versus September of 2014, for example, the U.S. dollar has now strengthened on average against international currencies by about 15%. And I think we need to accept that now we're living in this stronger U.S. dollar environment. We've taken a lot of actions on the cost side, on the pricing side, and obviously with hedges. But we need to deal with this situation, and that's where we are right now. We feel that 37.5% to 38% given the new FX environment I think says a lot about all the work that we've done on the cost side to get there. Just to give you a sense, on a year-over-year basis, when I look at foreign exchange, that has an impact of almost 300 basis points on our margins. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay, thank you. And, Tim, can you speak to how you envision the upgrade rate of the iPhone installed base to play out over the next quarter or the next year? Somebody mentioned that U.S. carriers have reported really weak upgrade rates, not necessarily for iPhone, but across their installed base. The press is discussing only modest technology upgrades in your next iPhone cycle. And so those data points would lead investors to believe that the upgrade rate will be low, but curious if you have a different view. Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director I don't want to talk about phones that aren't announced. And so that aside, what we have seen in the past tense or current tense on the upgrade rate is that the iPhone upgrade rate for the iPhone 6S is very similar to the iPhone 5S. And I guess in retrospect, maybe that was a predictable thing, although we didn't predict it in the beginning. It took us a little time to realize that. The iPhone 6 was significantly higher than that, and so it likely accelerated upgrades that would have been in the current year ahead of those. And so what the future holds, we'll see. But I'm very optimistic about the future because I see so many signs that are positive. I see an installed base that has gotten incredibly large. I see a switcher rate that is the highest ever. I see the smartphone itself, led by iPhone, becoming even more instrumental and important to people's lives. It's becoming essential. And all of the things that are coming both in the fall, the things that we've announced that you can see with iOS 10, hopefully you're running by now with the beta, those and other things make it even more instrumental. And AI even makes it even more and more. As the phone becomes more and more your assistant, it's one of those that you're not going to leave without it. And so I see all of those things as vectors that are incredibly positive. I also really like what I've seen with the iPhone SE and the fact that it's opening the door to customers that we weren't reaching before and likely convincing some people to upgrade that wanted a smaller form factor but wanted to stay with iPhone, and so they were waiting for the iPhone SE. And so I see lots of positive things, and so that's how I look at it. Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question please? Operator We'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi - Bernstein Research Yes, thank you. You commented about the significant inventory drawdown in the quarter, $3.6 billion on the revenue side. So sell-through was $46 billion effectively, over 4 million iPhones, suggesting that sell-through iPhone sales were 45 million. When I look to your guidance for Q4, I actually have the opposite question of a previous question, which is in light of the true sell-through rate, which seems to reflect better than normal seasonality in Q3, likely some contribution and elasticity from the SE, when I look at Q4, it looks like you're guiding for iPhone unit on a sell-through basis to be flat or potentially down and for total company revenues to be only fractionally up and below the seasonality we see in Q4. So I guess my question is, are you expecting any drawdowns in channel inventory in fiscal Q4? Are my inferences around sell-through rate incorrect? Or given the business momentum that you spoke about in response to an earlier question and the hopefulness that you expressed in your prepared remarks, Tim, I'm actually surprised that the guidance isn't a bit stronger on the top line. Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Toni, let me take it. Starting with your comments on the June quarter, I just want to point out that when we talk about a $3.6 billion channel inventory reduction, that is not entirely related to iPhone. iPhone is the vast majority of that, but we did reduce channel inventory on all other products as well. So that probably leads you to different conclusions to the math that you have just expressed. On the September quarter, when I look at the sequential increase for iPhone units that we are expecting, I would say that it is, even with the sell-through adjustments that you've talked about, it's still pretty much in line with what we've seen in the past. As you know, we do not provide guidance for channel inventory. But I would say, in general, I think it's important to keep in mind that if we look around the world, we do see a lot of positive signs, but we also know that the macroeconomic environment is slowing down in a number of places around the world. And that needs to be taken into account in our guidance. Toni Sacconaghi - Bernstein Research Okay. Luca, I did understand the $3.6 billion, but you said over 4 million iPhones were drawn down. I added that to the 40.4 million, so that would suggest close to 45 million on a sell-through basis. So that was the basis for my observation. I was wondering if I could direct one at Tim. You talked about the upgrade cycle and how it elongated relative to the iPhone 6 and that it's similar to what you saw with the iPhone 5S. And my belief is that one of the bigger longer-term concerns for Apple is that the replacement cycle could just structurally elongate over time, particularly as your installed base of customers becomes less affluent and more international. So I guess my question is, you have a mechanism, which is the Apple Upgrade Program, which takes replacement cycle out of the equation and puts people on buying the phone as a service. And so I'd welcome any comments on how that program is doing. And then just more broadly, is Apple thinking about ways to sell not only the iPhone, but more of its products on a monthly type subscription basis, perhaps in a more bundled fashion so that you can add more predictability to what is now largely a transactional revenue model? Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director The iPhone demand is made up, as you know, of upgraders, switchers and new to smartphone. And so if you take it in reverse order for a minute and look at a new smartphone, smartphone penetration right now around the world at the end of December was 42%. And so there's quite a bit of room there. It is true that a lot of those are in emerging markets, but we have done  we've had reasonable business success in several emerging markets. And so we don't enter into those with no experience, although we will enter into them humbly. On the switcher side, we really like what we're seeing. And we think that from a user point of view, as the smartphone itself becomes more and more essential to people's daily lives, which is a part of what I had talked about before, a part of bringing it into the home in a bigger way and in the car and at work and so forth, we think people will put more and more focus on what they're buying and the thing that Apple does best, which is provide this killer experience. A killer user experience that's integrated across their lives I think becomes more important and I think that really plays to our advantage. I also think that the deployment of AI technology is something that we will excel at because of our focus on user experience, and so I like that. From an upgrade point of view, there are pluses and minuses as I see it. A plus is that more and more people have already joined upgrade programs. Some of these programs, like the one that you referenced that we've done, replaces the iPhone every year. There are also carriers that have similar kind of plans, where they also replace or change out the iPhone every year. Others have an 18-month clock. Some have a 24-month clock, and there are even some that have a 30-month clock. And so there's various time schedules there. And so, as of today, there are obviously a lot more people on those programs than ever before because they just started. It really got underway in a big way last year, in a smaller way two years ago. And so we'll see more of those this coming fall. The minus side is that the bifurcation of the smartphone from the service itself has a plus and a minus into it. The subsidy, the lack of that  and this is more of a U.S. phenomenon than the rest of the world, some of that can be a shock for people that were used to paying $199 for their smartphone. They come back in and they pay less for the service but they pay more for their smartphone. And so there's lots of pluses and minuses on this. But overall, as I look at this for Apple, and this is not a statement on the industry itself, but for Apple, I'm very optimistic. Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From Goldman Sachs, Simona Jankowski. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Tim, as you mentioned, you traveled to China during the quarter. And while you certainly sound encouraged on China and highlighted the Didi investment, there are some of the key services for Apple like iBooks and iTunes Movies that are still banned, and some of the local vendors appear to be gaining share. So can you just give us your perspective on the market, your expectations around getting those services back up, and also regaining share? Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director Yes, for books and movies, we currently have those stores off, as you mentioned. To put this in some context, those two stores for the months that we had them operational, which was several months, the revenue was less than $1 million. And so it's not a revenue-related issue. From our point of view, this is a service we want to provide our customers. And so we're working very closely with the appropriate government agencies, and we hope to make books and movies available again to our customers there. And so we'll see how that goes, but we're optimistic there. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. And in terms of just regaining share in that market more broadly? Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director I think we've always had  if you look at our share over time, our share in China tends to peak during launch windows. There's a higher high and a lower low there. There's a bigger difference between those two. And so what we have to do and what we're doing is innovating like crazy and delivering the best smartphone to our customers there. And if we do a really great job of that, which we will, then I'm confident that we'll do well. Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please? Operator Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co. Good afternoon. Tim, you gave some nice data points around Apple Pay. Can you remind us? Is this a business that ultimately impacts the Services line in any measurable way, or is Apple Pay generally about selling iPhones? And separately, when you just take a step back and look at the proof point that the augmented reality [AR] theme has had with this whole Pokémon phenomenon, how does it impact how you think about the future? I assume you think about it. I'm just curious what goes on in your mind when you see all that. Thanks. Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director On the Apple Pay side, the revenues from Apple Pay are in the Services line. The growth is astronomical, but the base is very small. And so for today, Apple Pay is very much about a great feature for our customers so that they can pay in a very simple, private, and secure way. In terms of AR and the Pokémon phenomenon, it's incredible what has happened there. I think it's a testament to what happens with innovative apps and the whole ecosystem and the power of being a developer being able to press a button, so to speak, and offer their product around the world. And just a certain developer has elected not to go worldwide yet because of the pressure on their servers, et cetera, because of the demand. But I'm sure that they will over time. It also does show, as you point out, that AR can be really great. And we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity. And so we're investing, and the number one thing is to make sure our products work well with other developers' products like Pokémon. And so that's the reason why you see so many iPhones out in the wild right now chasing Pokémons. Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co. Would you say there's going to be a computing shift to AR longer term? Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director I notice there are people that want to call it a new computer platform, and we'll see. I think there's a tendency in this industry to call everything new the next computer platform. However, that said, I think AR can be huge. So we'll see whether it's the next platform. But regardless, it will be huge. Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury Thanks, Gene. Can we have the next question, please? Operator We'll go to Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc. Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. I just want to follow up, Tim, if I could, related to the R&D pace of growth, clearly a lot of momentum there over the last couple years. But we're just trying to figure out how much of that is dedicated to existing products and services versus what's next? Can you give us a sense in terms of when investors should think about the ROI coming back to them from the R&D perspective? And a corollary to that, is it really restricted just to products and services currently, or can we see more of a cloud services apparatus evolve over time where you do more and more in the enterprise just given the core trips with SAP and Cisco and IBM? And then my follow-up for Luca is around ASPs for the iPhone. We keep getting a lot of questions around iPhone SE in terms of how cannibalistic could it be to the core iPhone franchise. Are you seeing any moderation in terms of the ASP pressures here? Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director On R&D growth, we do continue to invest significantly in R&D. The growth rates are still large on a year-over-year basis, and Luca can share the exact ones. But I think the recent quarter was in the mid-20% for R&D. The balance of the company we're managing more flattish from a year-over-year point of view. The products that are in R&D, there is quite a bit of investment in there for products and services that are not currently shipping or derivations of what is currently shipping. And so I don't want to talk about the exact split of it. But you can look at the growth rate and conclude that there's a lot of stuff that we're doing beyond the current products. Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Mark, on the ASP question, I talked about the $595 in Q3. It's down $65 on a year-over-year basis. Keep in mind, about $20 of that $65 is foreign exchange. So during the quarter, we had this combination of starting with no iPhone SE units in channel inventory, so we had to do an at least a partial channel fill that obviously had an impact on ASPs. And then the other element was the fact that we've reduced more than 4 million units of channel inventory on the high end. So the combination of these two things obviously had an impact on ASPs. But I think as I said or Tim said during the prepared remarks, we do expect iPhone ASP to improve sequentially as we move into the September quarter because these two factors that I just mentioned are not going to repeat. On cannibalization, of course we've got limited experience because the phone has been in the market just for a few weeks. But when we look at our survey data on iPhone SE, as Tim was saying, we believe that the iPhone SE is doing exactly what it was intended, which is we are seeing a higher rate of new to iPhone customers, which is obviously very important to us because we bring new people into the iOS ecosystem. And we see a higher rate of previous iPhone owners that really prefer the four-inch form factor. We have not seen clear evidence of cannibalization from iPhone 6S or iPhone 6S Plus. Of course, there's always going to be some level of cannibalization. But really to us what is much more relevant is the much bigger opportunity to bring more people into the iOS ecosystem. Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury Thanks, Mark. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From Credit Suisse, we'll hear from Kulbinder Garcha. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Thanks, just a couple questions for me. Luca, I just want to clarify that last point on ASPs on iPhone because last quarter it seemed that you were quite clear that that was a negative driver to the gross margin of the company. So I understand there are other drivers going into the September quarter. But just to be clear, the phone units you didn't sell through that were depleted in channel inventory, those are relatively high gross margin as well. That's the clarification. And then for Tim, on the Services side, as Apple has spoken more and more loudly I guess in the last three or four quarters, I just think about some of the comments you've made about the TV market and how it's been stuck I think in the 1960s and the 1970s and the experience hasn't changed. I understand you've got the Apple TV box out. But in terms of driving actual video-on-demand services, is that something that Apple wants to do themselves? Do you want a partner? Could you even build content? How do you think about that as an actual business opportunity as opposed to here's an Apple box and we sell some units, but it's not that meaningful to the overall company in terms of size? I'm just curious given the installed base and users you have. Thanks. Luca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President Kulbinder, on your question on iPhone ASP, I'm not sure if I understood it correctly. But clearly the iPhone SE has a downward impact on iPhone ASP, of course, because it comes at the low end of the range. From a gross margin perspective, it is slightly dilutive to company margins, but the impact is not particularly large. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Okay, okay. Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director On the Apple TV question, the introduction of Apple TV and tvOS last October and the subsequent OS releases and what's coming out this fall, think of that as building the foundation for what we believe can be a broader business over time. And so I don't want to be more precise than that. But you shouldn't look at what's there today and think we've done what we want to do. We've built a foundation that we can do something bigger off of. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Okay, thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director Thank you for the question. Nancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury Thank you, Kulbinder.

Muse  Evercore Toshiya Hari  Goldman Sachs Operator Good morning and welcome to the Analog Devices Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. Id like to now introduce your host for todays call, Mr. Ali Husain, Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Ali Husain All right, thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the Analog Devices third quarter FY16 earnings conference call. You can find our press release, relating financial schedules, and our investor toolkit, which includes additional information that we believe will be useful for investors, you could find that at investor.analog.com. As usual, Im joined by ADIs CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADIs CFO, Dave Zinsner. So, before we start, lets get through some disclosures. Please note the information were about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, and the proposed acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which we have reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in todays earnings release, which weve posted at investor.analog.com. And so with that lets get started. So revenue in the third quarter totaled $870 million and exceeded our revised guidance. Revenue increased 12% sequentially and increased 1% from the prior year. Our B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure in the aggregate were slightly down sequentially but grew 4% over the prior year. Now lets talk about our results by end market. The highly diverse industrial market represented 43% of revenue in the third quarter. All industrial sub sectors were stable to up sequentially in line with expectations, but the timing of customer orders in the aerospace and defense vertical led to a weaker than anticipated performance in this sector in the quarter. The automotive market at 15% of revenue decreased 2% sequentially in the seasonally slower July quarter, but importantly returned to year-over-year growth increasing 3%. We believe the headwinds from the passive safety market have largely abated, and were in fact very excited about our prospects for automotive revenue growth going forward. Turning now to the communications infrastructure market, at 20% of revenue sales to our hundreds of communications infrastructure customers were stable sequentially and grew 23% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, wireless infrastructure decreased while wireline infrastructure applications revenue increased, as customers continued to build out metro and inter-data center network infrastructure for 100 gig and 100 gig plus optical networking. Turning now to the consumer market, the consumer market typically drives significant ROI and free cash flow for ADI, and this market represented 21% of total sales in the quarter, increasing 131% sequentially. This strong sequential performance was due to better than anticipated portable consumer application revenue. So now Id like to turn the call back over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. With the exception of revenue and other expense, Daves comments on our third quarter P&L line items will exclude special items, which in the aggregate totaled $28 million for the quarter. When comparing our third quarter performance to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior quarter and year-over-year results, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included on Schedule E in todays earnings release. So with that, Dave, Ill turn it over to you. Dave Zinsner Thanks, Ali, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter was a very good quarter for ADI, with revenue increasing to $870 million and diluted earnings per share growing to $0.82, with both results exceeding our revised guidance. Gross margin of 66% increased 20 basis points from the prior quarter as cost savings and lower spend in the fabs offset lower utilization rates and mix. Inventory on a dollars basis decreased $7 million sequentially, and on a days basis decreased 16 days to 122 days. Were now expecting days of inventory to decline further in the fourth quarter and to be the range of 110 days to 115 days, in line with our model. Inventory and distribution channel on a dollars basis was modestly higher than in the prior quarter, and on a weeks basis remained at seven weeks, consistent with the prior quarter. Operating expenses increased 2% sequentially, lagging well behind the 12% sequential increase in revenue as we continued to manage our expenses very tightly and gain operating leverage in our financial model. As a result, operating profit before tax of $296 million, increased 24% sequentially, and as a percent of sales operating profit before tax expanded 330 basis points to 34.1%. Other expense in the third quarter was approximately $12 million. Given our recently announced acquisition of Linear Tech and related financing costs, we expect that our net interest expense will be approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter and remain at that quarterly run rate until we close the transaction. Our third quarter tax rate was approximately 10%, as we adjusted our full year tax rate down slightly to 12%. Excluding special items, our business delivered strong operating leverage, with diluted earnings per share of $0.82, increasing 28% sequentially on a 12% increase in revenue. Diluted EPS increased 6% over the prior year. At the end of the third quarter, our cash and short-term investment balance was $3.8 billion, with $860 million available domestically. We had approximately $1.8 billion in debt outstanding, which resulted in a net cash position of $2 billion. Our business strategy and consistent financial execution enabled strong free cash flow generation, which supports investments in our business and the return of cash to shareholders. Excluding a one-time item, over the past 12 months ADI has generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow, effectively converting each dollar of revenue into $0.32 of free cash flow, at the very high end of our free cash flow model range. In the third quarter alone, free cash flow margins expanded 600 basis points as compared to the prior year. In terms of cash returns to shareholders, over the past 12 months we have returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which represents a 90% free cash flow payout. I want to now take a minute to talk about our capital allocation philosophy in light of the recently announced Linear Tech acquisition. As we mentioned when we announced the deal, the combined companys pro forma free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis ending April 2016, would have increased from $1 billion to $1.7 billion. After the deal closes, we plan to use our combined cash generation to rapidly pay down the debt associated with the transaction. As a result, we anticipate our net debt to EBITDA to go from 3.8 times at deal close to approximately two times net debt to EBITDA within three years of the transaction closing, which translates into an approximate $1 billion per year expected debt paydown schedule. In order to facilitate this rapid deleveraging, we have suspended our share repurchase program. That said, the dividend remains a cornerstone of our capital allocation philosophy, and we intend to maintain our dividend policy. So in summary, this was a solid quarter on several fronts. We executed well in our business, and the diversity of our customers, applications, and markets, coupled with the sustainability of our innovation, enabled both revenue and diluted earnings per share to exceed our revised guidance. Were also very excited about the acquisition of Linear Tech, which we announced during the quarter, and Ill invite Vince to come on and say a few words in a minute. Now turning to our outlook and expectations for the fourth quarter, which, with the exception of revenue expectations is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes special items that are outlined in todays release. Were planning for another quarter of sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter. In the B2B markets of industrial, automotive, and communications infrastructure we are planning for aggregate demand to remain stable sequentially, and on a year-over-year basis to increase in the low-to-mid-single digits. In the consumer market, strong customer demand and increasing dollar content in portable applications, leads us to plan for continued sequential growth in this market. In total, we are planning for revenue in the fourth quarter to grow sequentially, and be in the range of $910 million to $970 million. We expect factory utilization in the fourth quarter to be similar to its third quarter level as we manage our days of inventory, and so we are planning for gross margins in the fourth quarter to decrease approximately 50 basis points to 65.5% on the expected mix of business. We are planning for operating expenses in the fourth quarter to increase slightly sequentially, but to significantly lag our expected sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter, and for operating margins to expand from their third-quarter levels. Based on these estimates and excluding any special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.94. Now before we move on to Q&A, Id like to invite Vince to say a few words about the recently announced Linear Tech combination. Vince? Vincent Roche Great, thanks, Dave. As you know late last month we announced an agreement to acquire Linear Technology Corporation. This is a transformative acquisition that brings together the two best franchises in the analog industry, and once we combine our highly complementary portfolios, will make us a market leader across all major analog product categories. Following last months announcement, Ive personally heard from many customers, from employees, and shareholders and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Our customers are excited to gain access to a comprehensive portfolio of the best brands in high-performance analog, the industrys best design engineers and FAE support, and a best-in-class supply chain all under one roof and with our continued commitment to the long-term support of our customers. Our employees as well are very excited by the opportunities created by combining our two complementary suites of high-performance analog products and technologies. Beyond that, both companies have long admired the technical expertise and acumen of the other, and our teams are looking forward to the collaboration and innovation possibilities when combining two of the best engineering teams on the planet. ADI and Linear are two amazing companies with very storied histories and vibrant cultures, and we plan to take the best of both companies to create something much greater than the some of the parts. We have many ties that bind us. We both believe that innovation and a passion for our customers success drives superior business results, and we share an intense focus on operational excellence across quality, reliability, supply chain, and of course financial returns. As a result of this combination, our financial profile is expected to be among the best in the industry with strong margins and free cash flow, which we expect will increase over time as we realize the financial synergies and cross-selling opportunities inherent in this transaction. And as Dave mentioned, ADIs anticipated free cash flow generation is expected to increase significantly from current levels. We believe that this combination is good for all of our stakeholders. For customers it will create a true innovation and support partner that is unmatched in the industry. For employees it will create a tremendous opportunity for professional growth and the ability to help redefine an industry. And for shareholders this acquisition will further diversify our end market exposure and strengthen our business and financial profile. Notably, we expect this transaction to be immediately accretive to earnings and free cash flow, and anticipate non-GAAP EPS accretion of 10% right out of the gates. There is no other team of people out there who could accomplish what we believe Analog and Linear will accomplish together. And Im very excited to get started on the next phase of our journey together. And so with that, well now start taking your questions. Ali Husain All right, great. Thanks, Vince. Just for callers on the line, just a quick reminder, please limit yourself to one question. If you have a follow-up, I ask that you please requeue. And again, we do this in the spirit of fairness so that all callers get to ask at least one of their questions. So we plan to run the call until 11. And so I think thats plenty of time to get to everyones questions.  So with that, operator, lets start the Q&A session. Folks on the line can ask questions of either myself, Vince or Dave. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Ambrish Srivastava Hi. Thank you very much. I had a quick clarification and then my question. Clarification, Dave, you mentioned on the dividend policy, you have been raising dividend consistently for as long as I can remember. You did mean to imply that you would be raising dividend consistently like you have in the past? And then my question on autos, good to see the headwind from MEMS kind of abating. What are the areas that you are excited about as you alluded to that you should expect to see growth in that segment? Thank you. Dave Zinsner Okay, Ill take the dividend question and Ill let Vince comment on the areas of automotive that were excited about. On the dividend policy, as you know our model is to grow our dividend over time at a rate of 5% to 10%, and that continues to be our model. Ambrish Srivastava Okay, thank you for that. Vincent Roche Yes. So okay on the automotive side, we play in three I would say premier spaces where innovation really matters. We play in powertrain and there for example we have new sensor technology. We have an ongoing stream of growth in the battery management area. And we have new modalities such as AMR, for example, managing or measuring very, very accurately sensing measuring torque, for example, which is an important modality in the car. Also, our audio infotainment solutions are becoming more and more adopted across many, many platforms across the OEMs in the global market. For example, recently we saw that  you probably saw Ford announced our  weve talked to you before about this A2B bus, a very, very efficient high integrity bus thats being used in the car to move media, audio media. Ford just announced with our brand the inclusion of that technology in two of their particular car models. Weve talked before as well about the growth of ADAS. We have a very strong position on 24 gigahertz radar solutions, microwave to bits, and we are starting to move with some very attractive solutions as well in the 77-gigahertz radar area. So I think weve a good spread of technologies across the various car platforms using our underlying strength in sensing, measuring, and interpreting in both the precision signal processing area as well as the very, very high speed signal processing area. Ali Husain Great. Thanks, Vince, and thanks, Ambrish, for the question. I think, Ambrish, you do highlight a good point which is if you actually look at our automotive business, excluding the passive safety area. Weve actually grown that business in the high-single digits year-over-year in the quarter. And I think that really speaks to the additional content that were getting into vehicles now, as Vince mentioned. And that we are really excited about going forward as well. So thanks for the question, and well get to the next caller please. Operator Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg Yes, thank you, great numbers. So my question is on the consumer business. So up 130% sequentially. Could you just talk about the dynamics there, how we should think about that business here in the back half of the year? Clearly a very volatile business but yes, if theres anything you can add on the actual trends in the second half, thatd be great. Thank you. Vincent Roche So Tore you mean trends in terms of how is going to do next quarter you mean? Tore Svanberg Well, just obviously 130% is not the actual growth of that business. Vincent Roche Right. Tore Svanberg Obviously think about the volatility? Vincent Roche Yes, I would say in the fourth quarter it certainly going to be up again. Thats going to be the driver of the sequential growth. Probably in the high 20s, low 30s percent virtually. Then the next quarter, last year we declined about 60%, I think, sequentially. But that was, partially its due to seasonality and then the other part of it that, there was a build of inventory last year in the fourth quarter and we had that kind of consumption of that inventory in the channel that affected demand for us. This year I think we have a closer linkage between supply and demand here on the consumer side. So I would expect us to decline seasonally in the first quarter but only seasonally. I dont think we would have this kind of ramp down due to overbuild in the inventory side of things in the supply chain. So it's probably going to be roughly half the rate of what we saw last year sequentially. Vincent Roche I think the way to look at this market overall, Tore, we take a long-term view to the consumer market like we do to all our markets in which we participate. We're picking out  with our customers we're picking the hardest problems to solve, were pointing our technology at these problems, and we look for areas where we can get sustainability from generation to generation. So we take a long-term view and then the market will do what the market does in terms of generation. But I think in the areas that we're playing, we're executing well, and we've got some very, very exciting technologies in the pipeline as well for the future here. Tore Svanberg Thats s great color. Thank you. Dave Zinsner Yes. Great, thanks, Tore, that's was a great question. And then I just pointed as I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks that business for ADI drives very strong ROI, very strong free cash flow business for the company; and if you note that certainly consumer grew a 131% or so, sequentially the operating margins for the company also expended  for the entire company expanded well over 300 basis points as a result, so great business to be and if you pick your spots. All right, well get to our next caller please. Operator Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Tristan Gerra Good morning. Just quick follow-up on the consumer question. You talked about some content increase, can you quantify this a little bit? Is it a mid-single digit content increase relative to what you had last year? Dave Zinsner Its about 30%. Tristan Gerra Okay. Thank you. Ali Husain All right, thanks for the question. Next caller please. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach Yes, thank you. As you work toward the Linear Tech deal, can you give us an update on just the Hittite integration kind of how its going versus initial expectation a couple of years ago? And then also just from a cross-selling perspective how thats performed in the opportunities that you have? Dave Zinsner Okay. So Ill talk about it from an operational standpoint and then Vince can talk big picture about how its gone. Just operationally I would say we're pretty much fully integrated. We had expectations to get synergies that would drive the kind of accretion up into the kind of high-teens and we've actually been successful with that, in fact we're actually a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be from an expense perspective. From a revenue pipeline perspective, we have seen a lot of activity in terms of design ins and in some case design wins where we have been either able to take product that Hittite sold and bring them into our customer base. Were actually vise versa, for example in the case of the military business, they've actually been able to bring ADI parts into their customer base. And that's going quite well. I would say thats exceeding our expectations. I wouldn't say that it shown up significantly on the revenue line just yet nor that we expect it to. This is  these are markets that have long design level, but from everything we can tell just looking at how the activity has transpired from the time we close till where we are today, we think we are ahead of where we thought we would be. I dont know if you have anything to add. Vincent Roche Yes, thats good color, Dave. I think we're approaching the LTC combination very much as we did with Hittite. We  I think with both Hittite and LTC, we share the same values essentially, we're very innovation centered, we very, very high standards in terms of how we execute in supply chain quality and financial returns. And that's not negotiable, that's what we strive for in these combinations. Obviously the cultures are different, but I view the cultural diversity as an opportunity to improve both companies. You know there are  when you get world-class companies who've been doing things very, very well as they were independently, youve got to listen very carefully and understand what each side has been doing and do your best to combine the entities to create something greater than the some of the parts we did that with Hittite and that's the approach we're taking as well with LTC. And when I look at the combination of Hittite with ADI, for example, with our customers in communication infrastructure, broad-based communications activity, in the instrumentation, the aerospace and defense areas, it's really exciting to see how we are now solving big problems from end-to-end. Weve got the unique capabilities. I think we are probably the only high performance microwave to big supplier out there that can run the gambit of technologies and solve big footprint radio problems for our customers. So I think obviously with LTC, we get the real strength that they bring in the power area and some of the mix signal areas in the little niches. So my sense is we will take the very same approaches that we did with Hittite, we've learned a lot as well through the process. And we will  as I said, listen very, very carefully to making sure that we understand the best practices that we use them across technology, product development, supply chain quality and customer support, of course. Craig Hettenbach Got it. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi Group. Chris Danely Hey, thanks guys. So if we incorporate your guidance for the individual product segments for the fiscal Q4 for fiscal 2016, I think comm industrial and auto are all essentially flat. So what sort of growth would we expected for those three segments? And you can just do relative if you want for fiscal 2017 and then how much would consumer would up  would be expect to be up for fiscal 2017? Dave Zinsner Difficult to say at this point how all the stuff is going to transpire. We actually haven't done our plan or annual operating plan for 2017 yet, which is due to happen in the next couple of months. I would say that our expectation is that the industrial market grows normally and kind of in the mid-single digits kind of GDP plus a little. So I think that's kind of how we're building it, whether that happens in 2017 probably has more to do with how the macro does than anything, but I think it's a good rule of thumb to think about the growing in those kind of rates. Automotive I think over time should be back into the levels that Ali talked about with the sub segments which is to grow in the high-single digits, it's been way down a bit obviously by this passive safety business kind of coming off, but thats kind of running its course. It seems to be the driver for automotive stay flat; its still going to be a little bit of a headwind although a smaller headwind into next year. But I think automotive has a chance to start to move, I think it grew a few percent or will have grown a few percent this year, probably grows mid-single digits next year and probably grows up to the high-single digits the following year given all of the exciting opportunities we have that Vince talked about. In the comm space if anybody guess I think over time we think that our technology which is ahead of competitors will allow us to drive share gains in that market. And so even if the market itself, the CapEx environment of comm infrastructure market is kind of really low single-digit CapEx increases year-over-year, we think we will grow faster than that because of our position in that marketplace. And then the consumer market, obviously it was down or should be down most likely year-over-year this year as we won't have the same inventory build we had last year which kind of hit us this year. But I think next year as an opportunity to have a pretty decent year because this year was actually way down by the fact that they were digesting inventory in the first half of the year. Next year that wont be the case, on top of that we will get the full year effect of the dollar content improvements that we got at the end of this year. So we're cautiously optimistic about the consumer business having a decent year next year. Chris Danely Great. Thanks a lot, Dave. Dave Zinsner Sure. Operator Your next question is Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis Yes, thanks for taking the question. Dave, I was hoping you could just comment on the ends of the outlook range on revenues. Is the gap between the low end and the high end just allowing for still uncertain macro or is it just related to violence is in any of the segments for different types of build plan assumptions? And any color on what would swing things to the low end or high end would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Dave Zinsner Good question, Craig. A part of it is the fact that consumer tends to have a little bit of uncertainty built in. Come in with quite a bit of backlog but sometimes that backlog can shift around towards the end of the quarter a little bit and that can affect the quarter number even though it doesnt affect kind of the full build plan over time. The other piece was you just have to build a little bit of cushion in for kind of a macro uncertainty that might hit us at some point. We dont expect that which is why kind of the middle of the range is a pretty decent increase. But we did build in some cushion just in case something kind of surprised us. But I would tell you that we come in, in a very good position from a backlog perspective. And so although we give a wide range, we feel pretty good about them hitting the middle part of that range. And if things go better than that, we could hit the higher end of the range. Ali Husain All right, great. Thanks, next question. Operator Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC. Amit Daryanani Thanks, good morning, guys. Just a question on the industrial side. Sounds like part of the year-over-year decline was driven by this aerospace and defense orders getting pushed out, are the timing getting pushed out [indiscernible]. Can you just talk about what sort of revenue did you end up missing, in July quarter because of that? And is it logical to assume that you picked this backup in the October quarter and you could see a better growth in the industrial segment in that case? Dave Zinsner Yes, so the industrial weakness was really, as Ali actually mentioned, it was really specific to aerospace and defense thats programmatic sometimes in certain particular quarters they may not take as much as we have forecasted just by the timing of the programs. We do expect that to resume in the fourth quarter, come back in the fourth quarter. And that was really the most significant impact. We didnt really expect industrial to have significant improvement sequentially. So its not all together surprising that we were down $10 million. But it was in that kind of range that where the miss occurred. On the automotive side, I would say we kind of hit where we thought we would. We thought we would be down around 3%, I think were down sequentially down 2%. So we did actually marginally better than we expected in the automotive space. So thats going, I would say better than expected. Vincent Roche Yes. And let me just give you a little color on the industrial segment if I can, I mean really everything within the industrial space performed as we had expected, everything was stable to slightly up sequentially. Let me give you a little more color then. In North America we had a good quarter in factory automation. We believe thats driven by stabilization in the oil and gas space. In China, renewable energy did particularly well. And as Dave mentioned the aerospace and defense area hit a bit of an air pocket this quarter. But I think if you look it on a trailing 12-month basis that business has actually done very, very well for ADI. And really the acquisition of Hittite has really, as Vince mentioned earlier, reinvigorated that business for us. Weve got a guy who is running that business hes doing an amazing job. What I think is a pretty expensive portfolio in that area. So we think A&D is actually a growth market for us going forward. And there  in there the customers are really looking at these old mechanical systems that are expensive and they are looking to replace them with higher performance cheaper silicon solutions and that really increases our content meaningfully in those systems overtime. So I think looking at any of these markets in a quarter, particularly in lumpy markets can be fraught with peril. I think if you take a longer-term view, I think these markets are doing pretty nicely for ADI. So well appreciate the question and next question. Operator Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess in the third quarter then you mentioning about $10 million offset from the aero, but you had originally guided the B2B business up in the mid-to-upper single digits. Vincent Roche Yes. Stacy Rasgon $10 million differential still wouldnt quite get you there. So Im wondering what other areas in the quarter were potentially weaker than you thought. And I was also hoping if you could give us a little more color on the segment basis for what you expect for the next quarter beyond just the aggregate platform. Vincent Roche Right. Well the other area that was little less than planned was the communications market, it declined about 1%, I think sequentially. We expected that business to be up this quarter. Dave Zinsner In mid-single digits Vincent Roche I would say that was customer specific. There was one particular customer that did quite a bit weaker than expect. Dave Zinsner On the wireless side. Vincent Roche On the wireless side, and there was some color around India pushing out some of their infrastructure build outs that may have contributed to that. That was the other area that surprised us. And then your other part of your question Stacy is how I expect the end markets to play out in the fourth quarter. I would think that we mentioned B2B was likely to be flat. I think the combination of industrial and auto is likely to be up a bit and I think communications might be marginally weaker. Stacy Rasgon Thank you. Ali Husain Excellent, next caller. Operator Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Dave, you got interest income up throughout  until the close of the deal. Could you just talk about what debt you're adding and at what interest rate? And does that come off the $7.3 billion that you are planning on raising to acquire Linear? Dave Zinsner Yes, its really just the  so when we executed the agreement with Linear Tech  Linear, we had to enter into a underwriting commitment with set of banks to provide, so that the funding was essentially guaranteed. We havent drawn any of the money, but banks don't agree to do that without you agreeing to pay them something. So the step up from what was about $12 million a quarter up to what is going to be around $20 million give or take is really that cost of them providing that commitment, even though we havent borrowed anything. That then goes away once we enter into the agreement with or rather close the deal with Linear Tech. And then therell be a new financing cost obviously which is actually the drawn down amount, which as I indicated was going to be around 3% pretax on what was sort out being $11 billion but quickly paydown to about $7.5 billion. Blayne Curtis Perfect, thanks. Ali Husain Thanks, Blayne. Operator Your next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore Hi, guys. Just want to ask a question on the communications area. That in past calls youve been pretty bullish about the expectations there. I know you talked about the wireless being weak in both the quarter and it seems like even in the guide you are talking comms being a little bit weaker. Can you talk about any confidence or what level of confidence you have in that communication segment growing going forward? Vincent Roche Yes, its a good question. So we look at the comms infrastructure market in general, its a very important market for ADI. And as always we take a long-term view to how we invest, how we pick our spots and how we invest there. So were solving radio problems for our customers, I believe with a level of completeness that is quite unique. And with the addition of Hittite to our portfolio were very well-positioned in microwave to bits. And of course with the addition of the linear portfolio were able to attach the high-performance power products which will enable us to even offer more complete solutions to our customers. So I think the way to look at this market whatever happens with the short-term gyrations the challenges that our customers are facing are really immense. The problems are getting harder and harder from generation to generation. They are trying to solve the ongoing problem with spectral efficiency, information integrity, power efficiency and those problems will persist. And were in a better position than ever to solve these problems. So the markets are going to gyrate, its very, very hard to predict its quite a lumpy business as we always say, its hard predict quarter-to-quarter whats going to happen. But we view the whole comms infrastructure area as, really the electricity of the modern economy and the things that are under our control, how we innovate, how we engage with our customers. Were doing better there than ever, we continue to make improvements and I believe were poised to take share. So whatever the market is were poised to take share as the years move on here. So I think thats the way to view communications infrastructure. Ali Husain All right, Ross. Thank you, good question. The next caller. Operator Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So within your broad-based industrial business, can you just talk about the geographical demand trends you saw in Q3, I know you touched upon some specific product drivers in certain geographies? But maybe just touch upon sort of the broad geographical trends, particularly China since I think your industrial business in China has been a strong driver over the last couple of quarters. And then maybe touch upon whats implied within the fourth quarter industrial guidance again from a geographical perspective. Thank you. Dave Zinsner Sure. Good question Harlan, let me take that one. Okay so by region Id say North America and Europe were a little bit weaker sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, even though factory automation was quite strong in North America, our A&D business tends to be more focused in North America. And so as a result of that being weak, North America ended up being a weaker region for us in the industrial space. China was very strong again as you mentioned it is a key area for us in the industrial space. That was strong on instrumentation, applications, smart city and energy type applications. And as I mentioned earlier North America factory automation was pretty strong on stable oil and gas. As we look forward to the fourth quarter, it's actually an interesting question that you post because generally speaking the fourth quarter for industrial tends to be down in the mid single-digits. This time were expecting industrial to be pretty stable to the third quarter level and there's a few reasons for that why we're feeling I guess relatively bullish on that market in the next quarter. The aerospace and defense sector we expect to come back a little bit in the following quarter. And frankly if you look at the orders in distribution, they are currently pretty strong and I think if you compare that to some of the outlooks painted by some of the larger distributors out there, their book-to-bills are trending at parity or above parity so that would support the strong flows were seeing in distribution. So as a result I think when you package up all of those disparate points we come up with a view the next quarter, the industrial market should be pretty stable to its third quarter levels here, so hopefully that answers the question and will get to our next caller. Operator Your next question comes from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Cody Acree Hey, thanks guys for taking my questions. With the Linear acquisition what are your long-term thoughts on your capacity needs and how that might impact margins? Dave Zinsner What we'll have four fabs on a combined basis and so we'll have plenty of capacity for the future demand of the business. We've had utilization down this quarter expected to be down next quarter, probably would be down again in the first  at this level in the first quarter again. And then it steps up a bit, their utilization is actually pretty good. So I think that for the foreseeable future, I think we feel pretty good about what our capacity looks like. Vincent Roche Yes, I think job number one when you think about fabs and foundry. So the job number one is to make sure, that across the huge breadth of SKUs that we've got that are very, very important to particularly our industrial and B2B customers. Job number one is to make sure we have no supply chain interruptions whatsoever. Both LTC and ADI have, we got very, very high scores for being able to supply a huge diversity of products. Over very, very long periods of time and that's a tremendous value to our customers. So job number one is to make sure that we don't diminish that value in any way. And as Dave said, we manage utilization on a dynamic basis to make sure that we met supply and demand and that will continue to be the way. Ali Husain Yes. I think it's worthy of mentioning here this transaction is to better serve our customers so let's not lose side of that. Vincent Roche Okay, good question. Well move on to our next caller. Operator Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. David Wong Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea in the longer run how 5G might affect your content opportunity and comps infrastructure. Is there any additional opportunity or are the systems essentially the same? Vincent Roche Well, apparently the demand for spectral efficiency is going to increase several orders of magnitude. And one of the methods that they're going to use to get there obviously the bandwidth has got to increase but were going to be moving well into the microwave area. So the complexity of the problem is going to significantly increase in terms of all the things that we've been talking about, in terms of spectral efficiency, power management, power efficiency, obviously cost per bit and so and so forth. So with each successive generation, there has been more pressure on the technology to deliver ever increasing levels of, as our customers with a productivity, innovation productivity. So our belief, David, is that we're looking at orders of magnitude of complexity increase, which will continue to put pressure on our technology. But that's in our wheelhouse. That's what we like. We like hard problems to solve. That's what we build our business on. David Wong Great. Ali Husain Thanks, David. Thank you next question. Operator Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer Yes. Good morning guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Dave, I wanted to go back to the consumer business. If I look at a year-over-year compare, July quarter consumer was down about 10, the midpoint of your guidance is down close to 20% year-over-year and notwithstanding sort of the inventory issues last year, I would have stopped the July quarter would have been a more difficult compare quarter because my understanding was that July last year benefited from builds beginning early in the quarter throughout the quarter. And this year the July quarter really only benefited from the month of July builds for handsets. And so I'm kind of hoping you can kind of help circle, or square the circle there for me as to why year-over-year growth would be so much worse in the October quarter than the July quarter in the consumer business? Dave Zinsner Yes. I mean simply put, John, we just had an inventory build that was pretty significant in the fourth quarter. And we do not expect hopefully to have had happen this time around. It will be more closely aligned with demand. I would say that we do have a range and as you get to the higher end of the range that would suggest a lower  I guess a lower year-over-year decline, yes I guess would be the way to describe it. So that's obviously a possibility but not what we've built into the plan or the midpoint of the forecast. John Pitzer And Dave did the July quarter only benefit from builds in the month of July or did builds happen earlier in July quarter than we thought or than you initially thought on the last conference call? Dave Zinsner No, it was definitely more of a July ramp in the third quarter. I would say that probably on a weekly basis, was probably at a higher level than it was last year on a direct compare of the months of July for this year and last year. John Pitzer Thank you. Dave Zinsner Sure. Operator Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. A quick question around the Linear acquisition. First can you remind us of the timing, expected timing to close? And Dave, can you also sort of relate your early experiences coming to ADI and then also your experiences working to help integrate Hittite and maybe string a narrative as to the types of things we should expect to hear around integration when that begins. Dave Zinsner Okay, Ill let Ali talk about the timing piece. Ali Husain Okay, all right sounds good. So, yes, I realize that question is top of mind regarding time, but were not going to comment on the regulatory approval process at this stage. You see the conditions to the closing the transaction including required regulatory filings, they are all going to be in the Form S-4 registration statement and the proxy statement that ADI and Linear will be falling in connection with the merger in the upcoming weeks. So that takes care of the timing, Dave. Dave Zinsner Good lawyered up comment, Ali. Vincent Roche Okay, so on the William Stein I'm a good reader Vincent Roche On the integration side, obviously this is going to be different. It's bigger. It's on a different coast so it's not quite as  it's not in our backyard so we have that aspect of things. But I would say fundamentally it's going to be similar. What I think we do is, we buy really good companies and really good companies don't need to be fixed. And what we try to do is take the best aspects of each company and leverage them in the combined company to make something better than the some of the parts. So that's really what we intend to do. We're just in the initial planning stages as we speak. Well probably have a more formalized plan as we work with our compatriots over there at Linear Tech to help to form a good integration plan together. And I think that will take the better part of the rest of our fiscal year to really kind of come to conclusion on. And then once we do have I think a more clear plan will definitely communicate that to investors and to analysts. But at the moment, I think just our fundamental premises take the best of both companies and make a better company is really how it's going to, the main ethos of the integration. I think its going to go well. I think we did a great job at Hittite doing those same things and every integration is different but I think the elements of that process are pretty much going to be the way, we approach at this time. And so I suspect it's going to be a really great combination, just the early reads from every customer we've heard from, our employees, as we've been able to talk, clearly about the Linear Tech, we haven't gotten to every Linear Tech employee yet, but the ones we have talked to I think they got the excitement of what this could mean and so I think its going be a tremendous combination. William Stein Thank you. Dave Zinsner Sure. Ali Husain Thank you. And I saw Dave dropped a tremendous all of Donald Trumps through  all right, a good question. Vincent Roche Huge. Dave Zinsner All of my Donald Trumps, thats scary. Ali Husain Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Steve Smigie Great. Thanks a lot guys. Vince, something you could maybe give a high level strategy comment, ADI obviously been very strong over the years in analog to digital converters, good amplifier portfolios with Linear adding, as you mentioned, fantastic power. Since you've got pretty much the soup to nuts great stuff on Analog, as we think about increasing IoT applications out there which traditionally hasnt been a big market for you guys, but if you think about that starting to invest more in digital makes sense may be ramping up investing DSP. I was just curious of your high level thoughts on where you go after you got the complete Analog portfolio here. Vincent Roche Yes, great question. Good question, Steve. So, yes, we view the IoT, it is the great kind of latest marketing buzz in the world of semiconductors today. But we view IoT has really an extension of the things we already do, so there's a need for precise sensing, precise signal conditioning and conversion at ultra low power levels. And our customers are asking us for, to be able to take some of the bits we generate and develop information to interpret with the bits and give them information which we do in areas for example like reliable healthcare monitoring. So I think the way to view it is we've got a platform of technologies that we apply to industrial applications, take industrial automation for example. So we've got the conversion technology, signal conditioning amplification, we got processing both on the DSP side. We've fixed function processing that was developed. We're quite a large user of ARM technologies for example a lot of our products now use  MCUs, very, very low power MCUs, which we traded for our applications. With the RF technologies that we can bring to bear for the connectivity and obviously power management is the core part of the overall solution as well. So the underlying foundation of silicon technologies will be supplemented over time with more algorithmic technology and lyric for example that we acquired several years ago is a key player in enabling us to bring out algorithmic technology to bear. We're looking at how we make each  anything that gets connected need security, so as connectivity in the IoT sector is synonymous, it needs security, so that something that we're actually experimenting with. We're looking at possibilities to acquire some technology there as well. So that's  what I've described to you is we've got a very, very broad base of technologies that are enabling ADI in our traditional markets, these more connected are IoT markets, where sensing, measuring and interpreting is very, very important. And we're looking for token technologies and organic developments to move to ADI further up the stack for the example into the interpretation using algorithmic technology as well as security and communications. Steve Smigie All right. Thank you. Vincent Roche So I hope that helps you. Operator Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Shankar Iyer Hi, thanks for letting me ask a question. This is Shankar on behalf of Vivek. A lot of good question asked about the segments but I just want to ask about the OpEx side of things. You guys mentioned you're having a tight OpEx control right now in Q3 and Q4 just guided to flat go up. But given Linear deal, are you going to be focused on keeping the OpEx at current levels till the deal close? Could you just talk about the trends from Q4 to middle of next year and then how you think about the business long-term? Dave Zinsner Okay. So I think when history is written on 2016, we will have been roughly flat year-over-year in OpEx. So I think I'd concur with you thats a pretty good OpEx control. I think our goal is really to be largely flat next year at the ADI level. And what we'll do is in certain cases reprioritize our investments into areas that we're more confident around the growth levels and shift things around as appropriate and not seek to add a lot of resources particularly as we're going to get a whole bunch of resources hopefully by the middle of next year in the form of Linear Tech in place. So that's kind of the goal  it likely means that OpEx normally comes down in the first quarter just because the revenue comes down and then it pops back up in the second quarter if revenue is kind of seasonal, but kind of roughly in these kinds of zip codes, plus or minus $10 million from where we are today. Vincent Roche Needless to say we're operating as two independent businesses till we close. So we're all the time, we're very opportunity-rich as a company and we're all the time looking to pick the best opportunities, make sure they're properly funded, and we're always looking for talents. So within the boundaries of an OpEx model that is spending 18% or 19% in R&D that's what we intend to do and scale it with revenue growth over time. Shankar Iyer Got it. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Kristen Shaka Hi. This is Kristen Shaka for Romit. Congrats on a great quarter guys. Vincent Roche Thank you. Kristen Shaka Just to go back to the consumer segment for a little bit, how did consumer business outside of your largest North American handset customer performed? Dave Zinsner Yes, I can take that one. I would tell you as we enter sort of the back half of the year for ADI the consumer business has some positive seasonality. And so it actually performed quite nicely on a sequential basis and it was about stable to the prior year. So hopefully, that's helpful, and we can get to the next question. Operator Your next question is from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Dave Zinsner Ian, are you there? Ian Ing Yes. Hi, thanks a lot. I believe at one point you gave a full year CapEx target of $140 million to $150 million, you're running below that. Is that because of the Linear deal perhaps getting accessed to some equipment and factory outputs and maybe there's some spending you won't need here? Dave Zinsner No, we're just generally sent a budget that we're going to spend at 4% of revenue in  I think coming into year we thought  we didn't suspect this air pocket we'd run into on the consumer side and so we had a higher expectation on CapEx, but given that the revenue was a bit lower, we lowered the CapEx to this so we could maintain the 4%. Vincent Roche Yes, and so the new numbers somewhere in the range of $130 million to $135 million for the year or so. Ali Husain Thanks, Ian. Good question. Next caller please. Operator Your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin Hi, guys. Thanks for taking for my question. Just given some of the color earlier on some of the growth in your wired infrastructure business because of the 100 gig optical. I was wondering if you could provide some more color on whether that's primarily driven by hyper scale data center customers or if there are some teleco carrier CapEx thats driving that as well? And related to that is looking forward is set pretty much running in line with demand or is there some big element of capacity build ahead or build out for us  for consumption around this year? Thanks. Vincent Roche Yes, good question. It's driven by demand. I think there's a very, very good balance between what we're seeing in terms of demand and supply. There's obviously a huge amount of activity in the intra data center connectivity, and we're participating in that with our customers, also long haul and kind of metro build outs, and I think there's a good balance between the three, but it seems that the data center is hotter at this point in time and looks like it will be a wave for several years to come. So I think it's a good mix and very good balance between demand and supply here. Ali Husain All right, Stephen, thanks. Next caller. Operator Next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse Yes, good morning, thank you for squeezing me in. I guess a quick question around the Linear merger; curious what kind of conversations if any you've had in terms of locking up talent there. And as you think about your compensation plan versus theirs, what are the implications to OpEx going forward? Vincent Roche Well, we're operating as two separate companies until we close and obviously when you look at both companies actually we've had tremendous  we've got tremendously long tenure in both companies and the attrition rates run very, very, very low in both companies. And I expect that to be what it will  that will maintain its pace for many, many years to come. People remain with these companies because we do exciting things. We solve big, big hard problems. We've got very strong cultures. And I believe that just as it was so with Hittite and ADI, it is our goal to make sure that we win the hearts and minds of all of our engineers, who really create the value for both companies, and I'm very confident about that based on the conversations I've so far had with the LTC leadership and I see that as being a tremendous value and strength of both companies. Dave Zinsner And I would say that from an OpEx management perspective we run in this  into this every time we integrate a company there are always slight differences in terms of how the compensation works and I think we're pretty good at figuring out a way that we can do it that works for employees and keep them energized and engaged and simultaneously doesn't have an impact on our total OpEx and our ability to manage our OpEx appropriately. So we haven't worked out the particulars of that and that will also be done over the coming months. But I feel pretty confident that we'll be able to address employees concerns and shareholders concerns and come up with something that's optimal. Ali Husain Thanks C.J. And Okay. So we're past 11:00 AM here Eastern. So that means we have time for one last caller. Operator And our final question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari Hey, good morning and thanks for squeezing me in. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your content win and consumer. Where are you seeing the design wins? How fast is content this year growing relative to last year? And how sustainable is that rate of growth going into next year? Thank you so much. Dave Zinsner Well, as I said the content increases 30%. We can't get into the details. We have confidentiality of our requirements with our customers that don't allow us to go into any more detail other than that. Vincent Roche You know the wins are consistent with our stated strategy. We play in really, really high quality problem areas in the user experience and the wins weve had are very, very consistent with that stated strategy. Ali Husain Okay, great. Well, that was last question. So as a remainder, our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results will be issued on Wednesday, November 22 at 8:00 AM Eastern and the earnings call will began two hours later 10:00 AM Eastern. So that's it from us from Norwood, Massachusetts. And so, thanks for joining us this morning. We will talk to you soon. Operator This concludes todays Analog Devices conference call.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Ambrish Srivastava Hi. Thank you very much. I had a quick clarification and then my question. Clarification, Dave, you mentioned on the dividend policy, you have been raising dividend consistently for as long as I can remember. You did mean to imply that you would be raising dividend consistently like you have in the past? And then my question on autos, good to see the headwind from MEMS kind of abating. What are the areas that you are excited about as you alluded to that you should expect to see growth in that segment? Thank you. Dave Zinsner Okay, Ill take the dividend question and Ill let Vince comment on the areas of automotive that were excited about. On the dividend policy, as you know our model is to grow our dividend over time at a rate of 5% to 10%, and that continues to be our model. Ambrish Srivastava Okay, thank you for that. Vincent Roche Yes. So okay on the automotive side, we play in three I would say premier spaces where innovation really matters. We play in powertrain and there for example we have new sensor technology. We have an ongoing stream of growth in the battery management area. And we have new modalities such as AMR, for example, managing or measuring very, very accurately sensing measuring torque, for example, which is an important modality in the car. Also, our audio infotainment solutions are becoming more and more adopted across many, many platforms across the OEMs in the global market. For example, recently we saw that  you probably saw Ford announced our  weve talked to you before about this A2B bus, a very, very efficient high integrity bus thats being used in the car to move media, audio media. Ford just announced with our brand the inclusion of that technology in two of their particular car models. Weve talked before as well about the growth of ADAS. We have a very strong position on 24 gigahertz radar solutions, microwave to bits, and we are starting to move with some very attractive solutions as well in the 77-gigahertz radar area. So I think weve a good spread of technologies across the various car platforms using our underlying strength in sensing, measuring, and interpreting in both the precision signal processing area as well as the very, very high speed signal processing area. Ali Husain Great. Thanks, Vince, and thanks, Ambrish, for the question. I think, Ambrish, you do highlight a good point which is if you actually look at our automotive business, excluding the passive safety area. Weve actually grown that business in the high-single digits year-over-year in the quarter. And I think that really speaks to the additional content that were getting into vehicles now, as Vince mentioned. And that we are really excited about going forward as well. So thanks for the question, and well get to the next caller please. Operator Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg Yes, thank you, great numbers. So my question is on the consumer business. So up 130% sequentially. Could you just talk about the dynamics there, how we should think about that business here in the back half of the year? Clearly a very volatile business but yes, if theres anything you can add on the actual trends in the second half, thatd be great. Thank you. Vincent Roche So Tore you mean trends in terms of how is going to do next quarter you mean? Tore Svanberg Well, just obviously 130% is not the actual growth of that business. Vincent Roche Right. Tore Svanberg Obviously think about the volatility? Vincent Roche Yes, I would say in the fourth quarter it certainly going to be up again. Thats going to be the driver of the sequential growth. Probably in the high 20s, low 30s percent virtually. Then the next quarter, last year we declined about 60%, I think, sequentially. But that was, partially its due to seasonality and then the other part of it that, there was a build of inventory last year in the fourth quarter and we had that kind of consumption of that inventory in the channel that affected demand for us. This year I think we have a closer linkage between supply and demand here on the consumer side. So I would expect us to decline seasonally in the first quarter but only seasonally. I dont think we would have this kind of ramp down due to overbuild in the inventory side of things in the supply chain. So it's probably going to be roughly half the rate of what we saw last year sequentially. Vincent Roche I think the way to look at this market overall, Tore, we take a long-term view to the consumer market like we do to all our markets in which we participate. We're picking out  with our customers we're picking the hardest problems to solve, were pointing our technology at these problems, and we look for areas where we can get sustainability from generation to generation. So we take a long-term view and then the market will do what the market does in terms of generation. But I think in the areas that we're playing, we're executing well, and we've got some very, very exciting technologies in the pipeline as well for the future here. Tore Svanberg Thats s great color. Thank you. Dave Zinsner Yes. Great, thanks, Tore, that's was a great question. And then I just pointed as I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks that business for ADI drives very strong ROI, very strong free cash flow business for the company; and if you note that certainly consumer grew a 131% or so, sequentially the operating margins for the company also expended  for the entire company expanded well over 300 basis points as a result, so great business to be and if you pick your spots. All right, well get to our next caller please. Operator Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Tristan Gerra Good morning. Just quick follow-up on the consumer question. You talked about some content increase, can you quantify this a little bit? Is it a mid-single digit content increase relative to what you had last year? Dave Zinsner Its about 30%. Tristan Gerra Okay. Thank you. Ali Husain All right, thanks for the question. Next caller please. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach Yes, thank you. As you work toward the Linear Tech deal, can you give us an update on just the Hittite integration kind of how its going versus initial expectation a couple of years ago? And then also just from a cross-selling perspective how thats performed in the opportunities that you have? Dave Zinsner Okay. So Ill talk about it from an operational standpoint and then Vince can talk big picture about how its gone. Just operationally I would say we're pretty much fully integrated. We had expectations to get synergies that would drive the kind of accretion up into the kind of high-teens and we've actually been successful with that, in fact we're actually a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be from an expense perspective. From a revenue pipeline perspective, we have seen a lot of activity in terms of design ins and in some case design wins where we have been either able to take product that Hittite sold and bring them into our customer base. Were actually vise versa, for example in the case of the military business, they've actually been able to bring ADI parts into their customer base. And that's going quite well. I would say thats exceeding our expectations. I wouldn't say that it shown up significantly on the revenue line just yet nor that we expect it to. This is  these are markets that have long design level, but from everything we can tell just looking at how the activity has transpired from the time we close till where we are today, we think we are ahead of where we thought we would be. I dont know if you have anything to add. Vincent Roche Yes, thats good color, Dave. I think we're approaching the LTC combination very much as we did with Hittite. We  I think with both Hittite and LTC, we share the same values essentially, we're very innovation centered, we very, very high standards in terms of how we execute in supply chain quality and financial returns. And that's not negotiable, that's what we strive for in these combinations. Obviously the cultures are different, but I view the cultural diversity as an opportunity to improve both companies. You know there are  when you get world-class companies who've been doing things very, very well as they were independently, youve got to listen very carefully and understand what each side has been doing and do your best to combine the entities to create something greater than the some of the parts we did that with Hittite and that's the approach we're taking as well with LTC. And when I look at the combination of Hittite with ADI, for example, with our customers in communication infrastructure, broad-based communications activity, in the instrumentation, the aerospace and defense areas, it's really exciting to see how we are now solving big problems from end-to-end. Weve got the unique capabilities. I think we are probably the only high performance microwave to big supplier out there that can run the gambit of technologies and solve big footprint radio problems for our customers. So I think obviously with LTC, we get the real strength that they bring in the power area and some of the mix signal areas in the little niches. So my sense is we will take the very same approaches that we did with Hittite, we've learned a lot as well through the process. And we will  as I said, listen very, very carefully to making sure that we understand the best practices that we use them across technology, product development, supply chain quality and customer support, of course. Craig Hettenbach Got it. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi Group. Chris Danely Hey, thanks guys. So if we incorporate your guidance for the individual product segments for the fiscal Q4 for fiscal 2016, I think comm industrial and auto are all essentially flat. So what sort of growth would we expected for those three segments? And you can just do relative if you want for fiscal 2017 and then how much would consumer would up  would be expect to be up for fiscal 2017? Dave Zinsner Difficult to say at this point how all the stuff is going to transpire. We actually haven't done our plan or annual operating plan for 2017 yet, which is due to happen in the next couple of months. I would say that our expectation is that the industrial market grows normally and kind of in the mid-single digits kind of GDP plus a little. So I think that's kind of how we're building it, whether that happens in 2017 probably has more to do with how the macro does than anything, but I think it's a good rule of thumb to think about the growing in those kind of rates. Automotive I think over time should be back into the levels that Ali talked about with the sub segments which is to grow in the high-single digits, it's been way down a bit obviously by this passive safety business kind of coming off, but thats kind of running its course. It seems to be the driver for automotive stay flat; its still going to be a little bit of a headwind although a smaller headwind into next year. But I think automotive has a chance to start to move, I think it grew a few percent or will have grown a few percent this year, probably grows mid-single digits next year and probably grows up to the high-single digits the following year given all of the exciting opportunities we have that Vince talked about. In the comm space if anybody guess I think over time we think that our technology which is ahead of competitors will allow us to drive share gains in that market. And so even if the market itself, the CapEx environment of comm infrastructure market is kind of really low single-digit CapEx increases year-over-year, we think we will grow faster than that because of our position in that marketplace. And then the consumer market, obviously it was down or should be down most likely year-over-year this year as we won't have the same inventory build we had last year which kind of hit us this year. But I think next year as an opportunity to have a pretty decent year because this year was actually way down by the fact that they were digesting inventory in the first half of the year. Next year that wont be the case, on top of that we will get the full year effect of the dollar content improvements that we got at the end of this year. So we're cautiously optimistic about the consumer business having a decent year next year. Chris Danely Great. Thanks a lot, Dave. Dave Zinsner Sure. Operator Your next question is Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis Yes, thanks for taking the question. Dave, I was hoping you could just comment on the ends of the outlook range on revenues. Is the gap between the low end and the high end just allowing for still uncertain macro or is it just related to violence is in any of the segments for different types of build plan assumptions? And any color on what would swing things to the low end or high end would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Dave Zinsner Good question, Craig. A part of it is the fact that consumer tends to have a little bit of uncertainty built in. Come in with quite a bit of backlog but sometimes that backlog can shift around towards the end of the quarter a little bit and that can affect the quarter number even though it doesnt affect kind of the full build plan over time. The other piece was you just have to build a little bit of cushion in for kind of a macro uncertainty that might hit us at some point. We dont expect that which is why kind of the middle of the range is a pretty decent increase. But we did build in some cushion just in case something kind of surprised us. But I would tell you that we come in, in a very good position from a backlog perspective. And so although we give a wide range, we feel pretty good about them hitting the middle part of that range. And if things go better than that, we could hit the higher end of the range. Ali Husain All right, great. Thanks, next question. Operator Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC. Amit Daryanani Thanks, good morning, guys. Just a question on the industrial side. Sounds like part of the year-over-year decline was driven by this aerospace and defense orders getting pushed out, are the timing getting pushed out [indiscernible]. Can you just talk about what sort of revenue did you end up missing, in July quarter because of that? And is it logical to assume that you picked this backup in the October quarter and you could see a better growth in the industrial segment in that case? Dave Zinsner Yes, so the industrial weakness was really, as Ali actually mentioned, it was really specific to aerospace and defense thats programmatic sometimes in certain particular quarters they may not take as much as we have forecasted just by the timing of the programs. We do expect that to resume in the fourth quarter, come back in the fourth quarter. And that was really the most significant impact. We didnt really expect industrial to have significant improvement sequentially. So its not all together surprising that we were down $10 million. But it was in that kind of range that where the miss occurred. On the automotive side, I would say we kind of hit where we thought we would. We thought we would be down around 3%, I think were down sequentially down 2%. So we did actually marginally better than we expected in the automotive space. So thats going, I would say better than expected. Vincent Roche Yes. And let me just give you a little color on the industrial segment if I can, I mean really everything within the industrial space performed as we had expected, everything was stable to slightly up sequentially. Let me give you a little more color then. In North America we had a good quarter in factory automation. We believe thats driven by stabilization in the oil and gas space. In China, renewable energy did particularly well. And as Dave mentioned the aerospace and defense area hit a bit of an air pocket this quarter. But I think if you look it on a trailing 12-month basis that business has actually done very, very well for ADI. And really the acquisition of Hittite has really, as Vince mentioned earlier, reinvigorated that business for us. Weve got a guy who is running that business hes doing an amazing job. What I think is a pretty expensive portfolio in that area. So we think A&D is actually a growth market for us going forward. And there  in there the customers are really looking at these old mechanical systems that are expensive and they are looking to replace them with higher performance cheaper silicon solutions and that really increases our content meaningfully in those systems overtime. So I think looking at any of these markets in a quarter, particularly in lumpy markets can be fraught with peril. I think if you take a longer-term view, I think these markets are doing pretty nicely for ADI. So well appreciate the question and next question. Operator Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess in the third quarter then you mentioning about $10 million offset from the aero, but you had originally guided the B2B business up in the mid-to-upper single digits. Vincent Roche Yes. Stacy Rasgon $10 million differential still wouldnt quite get you there. So Im wondering what other areas in the quarter were potentially weaker than you thought. And I was also hoping if you could give us a little more color on the segment basis for what you expect for the next quarter beyond just the aggregate platform. Vincent Roche Right. Well the other area that was little less than planned was the communications market, it declined about 1%, I think sequentially. We expected that business to be up this quarter. Dave Zinsner In mid-single digits Vincent Roche I would say that was customer specific. There was one particular customer that did quite a bit weaker than expect. Dave Zinsner On the wireless side. Vincent Roche On the wireless side, and there was some color around India pushing out some of their infrastructure build outs that may have contributed to that. That was the other area that surprised us. And then your other part of your question Stacy is how I expect the end markets to play out in the fourth quarter. I would think that we mentioned B2B was likely to be flat. I think the combination of industrial and auto is likely to be up a bit and I think communications might be marginally weaker. Stacy Rasgon Thank you. Ali Husain Excellent, next caller. Operator Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Dave, you got interest income up throughout  until the close of the deal. Could you just talk about what debt you're adding and at what interest rate? And does that come off the $7.3 billion that you are planning on raising to acquire Linear? Dave Zinsner Yes, its really just the  so when we executed the agreement with Linear Tech  Linear, we had to enter into a underwriting commitment with set of banks to provide, so that the funding was essentially guaranteed. We havent drawn any of the money, but banks don't agree to do that without you agreeing to pay them something. So the step up from what was about $12 million a quarter up to what is going to be around $20 million give or take is really that cost of them providing that commitment, even though we havent borrowed anything. That then goes away once we enter into the agreement with or rather close the deal with Linear Tech. And then therell be a new financing cost obviously which is actually the drawn down amount, which as I indicated was going to be around 3% pretax on what was sort out being $11 billion but quickly paydown to about $7.5 billion. Blayne Curtis Perfect, thanks. Ali Husain Thanks, Blayne. Operator Your next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore Hi, guys. Just want to ask a question on the communications area. That in past calls youve been pretty bullish about the expectations there. I know you talked about the wireless being weak in both the quarter and it seems like even in the guide you are talking comms being a little bit weaker. Can you talk about any confidence or what level of confidence you have in that communication segment growing going forward? Vincent Roche Yes, its a good question. So we look at the comms infrastructure market in general, its a very important market for ADI. And as always we take a long-term view to how we invest, how we pick our spots and how we invest there. So were solving radio problems for our customers, I believe with a level of completeness that is quite unique. And with the addition of Hittite to our portfolio were very well-positioned in microwave to bits. And of course with the addition of the linear portfolio were able to attach the high-performance power products which will enable us to even offer more complete solutions to our customers. So I think the way to look at this market whatever happens with the short-term gyrations the challenges that our customers are facing are really immense. The problems are getting harder and harder from generation to generation. They are trying to solve the ongoing problem with spectral efficiency, information integrity, power efficiency and those problems will persist. And were in a better position than ever to solve these problems. So the markets are going to gyrate, its very, very hard to predict its quite a lumpy business as we always say, its hard predict quarter-to-quarter whats going to happen. But we view the whole comms infrastructure area as, really the electricity of the modern economy and the things that are under our control, how we innovate, how we engage with our customers. Were doing better there than ever, we continue to make improvements and I believe were poised to take share. So whatever the market is were poised to take share as the years move on here. So I think thats the way to view communications infrastructure. Ali Husain All right, Ross. Thank you, good question. The next caller. Operator Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So within your broad-based industrial business, can you just talk about the geographical demand trends you saw in Q3, I know you touched upon some specific product drivers in certain geographies? But maybe just touch upon sort of the broad geographical trends, particularly China since I think your industrial business in China has been a strong driver over the last couple of quarters. And then maybe touch upon whats implied within the fourth quarter industrial guidance again from a geographical perspective. Thank you. Dave Zinsner Sure. Good question Harlan, let me take that one. Okay so by region Id say North America and Europe were a little bit weaker sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, even though factory automation was quite strong in North America, our A&D business tends to be more focused in North America. And so as a result of that being weak, North America ended up being a weaker region for us in the industrial space. China was very strong again as you mentioned it is a key area for us in the industrial space. That was strong on instrumentation, applications, smart city and energy type applications. And as I mentioned earlier North America factory automation was pretty strong on stable oil and gas. As we look forward to the fourth quarter, it's actually an interesting question that you post because generally speaking the fourth quarter for industrial tends to be down in the mid single-digits. This time were expecting industrial to be pretty stable to the third quarter level and there's a few reasons for that why we're feeling I guess relatively bullish on that market in the next quarter. The aerospace and defense sector we expect to come back a little bit in the following quarter. And frankly if you look at the orders in distribution, they are currently pretty strong and I think if you compare that to some of the outlooks painted by some of the larger distributors out there, their book-to-bills are trending at parity or above parity so that would support the strong flows were seeing in distribution. So as a result I think when you package up all of those disparate points we come up with a view the next quarter, the industrial market should be pretty stable to its third quarter levels here, so hopefully that answers the question and will get to our next caller. Operator Your next question comes from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Cody Acree Hey, thanks guys for taking my questions. With the Linear acquisition what are your long-term thoughts on your capacity needs and how that might impact margins? Dave Zinsner What we'll have four fabs on a combined basis and so we'll have plenty of capacity for the future demand of the business. We've had utilization down this quarter expected to be down next quarter, probably would be down again in the first  at this level in the first quarter again. And then it steps up a bit, their utilization is actually pretty good. So I think that for the foreseeable future, I think we feel pretty good about what our capacity looks like. Vincent Roche Yes, I think job number one when you think about fabs and foundry. So the job number one is to make sure, that across the huge breadth of SKUs that we've got that are very, very important to particularly our industrial and B2B customers. Job number one is to make sure we have no supply chain interruptions whatsoever. Both LTC and ADI have, we got very, very high scores for being able to supply a huge diversity of products. Over very, very long periods of time and that's a tremendous value to our customers. So job number one is to make sure that we don't diminish that value in any way. And as Dave said, we manage utilization on a dynamic basis to make sure that we met supply and demand and that will continue to be the way. Ali Husain Yes. I think it's worthy of mentioning here this transaction is to better serve our customers so let's not lose side of that. Vincent Roche Okay, good question. Well move on to our next caller. Operator Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. David Wong Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea in the longer run how 5G might affect your content opportunity and comps infrastructure. Is there any additional opportunity or are the systems essentially the same? Vincent Roche Well, apparently the demand for spectral efficiency is going to increase several orders of magnitude. And one of the methods that they're going to use to get there obviously the bandwidth has got to increase but were going to be moving well into the microwave area. So the complexity of the problem is going to significantly increase in terms of all the things that we've been talking about, in terms of spectral efficiency, power management, power efficiency, obviously cost per bit and so and so forth. So with each successive generation, there has been more pressure on the technology to deliver ever increasing levels of, as our customers with a productivity, innovation productivity. So our belief, David, is that we're looking at orders of magnitude of complexity increase, which will continue to put pressure on our technology. But that's in our wheelhouse. That's what we like. We like hard problems to solve. That's what we build our business on. David Wong Great. Ali Husain Thanks, David. Thank you next question. Operator Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer Yes. Good morning guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Dave, I wanted to go back to the consumer business. If I look at a year-over-year compare, July quarter consumer was down about 10, the midpoint of your guidance is down close to 20% year-over-year and notwithstanding sort of the inventory issues last year, I would have stopped the July quarter would have been a more difficult compare quarter because my understanding was that July last year benefited from builds beginning early in the quarter throughout the quarter. And this year the July quarter really only benefited from the month of July builds for handsets. And so I'm kind of hoping you can kind of help circle, or square the circle there for me as to why year-over-year growth would be so much worse in the October quarter than the July quarter in the consumer business? Dave Zinsner Yes. I mean simply put, John, we just had an inventory build that was pretty significant in the fourth quarter. And we do not expect hopefully to have had happen this time around. It will be more closely aligned with demand. I would say that we do have a range and as you get to the higher end of the range that would suggest a lower  I guess a lower year-over-year decline, yes I guess would be the way to describe it. So that's obviously a possibility but not what we've built into the plan or the midpoint of the forecast. John Pitzer And Dave did the July quarter only benefit from builds in the month of July or did builds happen earlier in July quarter than we thought or than you initially thought on the last conference call? Dave Zinsner No, it was definitely more of a July ramp in the third quarter. I would say that probably on a weekly basis, was probably at a higher level than it was last year on a direct compare of the months of July for this year and last year. John Pitzer Thank you. Dave Zinsner Sure. Operator Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. A quick question around the Linear acquisition. First can you remind us of the timing, expected timing to close? And Dave, can you also sort of relate your early experiences coming to ADI and then also your experiences working to help integrate Hittite and maybe string a narrative as to the types of things we should expect to hear around integration when that begins. Dave Zinsner Okay, Ill let Ali talk about the timing piece. Ali Husain Okay, all right sounds good. So, yes, I realize that question is top of mind regarding time, but were not going to comment on the regulatory approval process at this stage. You see the conditions to the closing the transaction including required regulatory filings, they are all going to be in the Form S-4 registration statement and the proxy statement that ADI and Linear will be falling in connection with the merger in the upcoming weeks. So that takes care of the timing, Dave. Dave Zinsner Good lawyered up comment, Ali. Vincent Roche Okay, so on the William Stein I'm a good reader Vincent Roche On the integration side, obviously this is going to be different. It's bigger. It's on a different coast so it's not quite as  it's not in our backyard so we have that aspect of things. But I would say fundamentally it's going to be similar. What I think we do is, we buy really good companies and really good companies don't need to be fixed. And what we try to do is take the best aspects of each company and leverage them in the combined company to make something better than the some of the parts. So that's really what we intend to do. We're just in the initial planning stages as we speak. Well probably have a more formalized plan as we work with our compatriots over there at Linear Tech to help to form a good integration plan together. And I think that will take the better part of the rest of our fiscal year to really kind of come to conclusion on. And then once we do have I think a more clear plan will definitely communicate that to investors and to analysts. But at the moment, I think just our fundamental premises take the best of both companies and make a better company is really how it's going to, the main ethos of the integration. I think its going to go well. I think we did a great job at Hittite doing those same things and every integration is different but I think the elements of that process are pretty much going to be the way, we approach at this time. And so I suspect it's going to be a really great combination, just the early reads from every customer we've heard from, our employees, as we've been able to talk, clearly about the Linear Tech, we haven't gotten to every Linear Tech employee yet, but the ones we have talked to I think they got the excitement of what this could mean and so I think its going be a tremendous combination. William Stein Thank you. Dave Zinsner Sure. Ali Husain Thank you. And I saw Dave dropped a tremendous all of Donald Trumps through  all right, a good question. Vincent Roche Huge. Dave Zinsner All of my Donald Trumps, thats scary. Ali Husain Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Steve Smigie Great. Thanks a lot guys. Vince, something you could maybe give a high level strategy comment, ADI obviously been very strong over the years in analog to digital converters, good amplifier portfolios with Linear adding, as you mentioned, fantastic power. Since you've got pretty much the soup to nuts great stuff on Analog, as we think about increasing IoT applications out there which traditionally hasnt been a big market for you guys, but if you think about that starting to invest more in digital makes sense may be ramping up investing DSP. I was just curious of your high level thoughts on where you go after you got the complete Analog portfolio here. Vincent Roche Yes, great question. Good question, Steve. So, yes, we view the IoT, it is the great kind of latest marketing buzz in the world of semiconductors today. But we view IoT has really an extension of the things we already do, so there's a need for precise sensing, precise signal conditioning and conversion at ultra low power levels. And our customers are asking us for, to be able to take some of the bits we generate and develop information to interpret with the bits and give them information which we do in areas for example like reliable healthcare monitoring. So I think the way to view it is we've got a platform of technologies that we apply to industrial applications, take industrial automation for example. So we've got the conversion technology, signal conditioning amplification, we got processing both on the DSP side. We've fixed function processing that was developed. We're quite a large user of ARM technologies for example a lot of our products now use  MCUs, very, very low power MCUs, which we traded for our applications. With the RF technologies that we can bring to bear for the connectivity and obviously power management is the core part of the overall solution as well. So the underlying foundation of silicon technologies will be supplemented over time with more algorithmic technology and lyric for example that we acquired several years ago is a key player in enabling us to bring out algorithmic technology to bear. We're looking at how we make each  anything that gets connected need security, so as connectivity in the IoT sector is synonymous, it needs security, so that something that we're actually experimenting with. We're looking at possibilities to acquire some technology there as well. So that's  what I've described to you is we've got a very, very broad base of technologies that are enabling ADI in our traditional markets, these more connected are IoT markets, where sensing, measuring and interpreting is very, very important. And we're looking for token technologies and organic developments to move to ADI further up the stack for the example into the interpretation using algorithmic technology as well as security and communications. Steve Smigie All right. Thank you. Vincent Roche So I hope that helps you. Operator Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Shankar Iyer Hi, thanks for letting me ask a question. This is Shankar on behalf of Vivek. A lot of good question asked about the segments but I just want to ask about the OpEx side of things. You guys mentioned you're having a tight OpEx control right now in Q3 and Q4 just guided to flat go up. But given Linear deal, are you going to be focused on keeping the OpEx at current levels till the deal close? Could you just talk about the trends from Q4 to middle of next year and then how you think about the business long-term? Dave Zinsner Okay. So I think when history is written on 2016, we will have been roughly flat year-over-year in OpEx. So I think I'd concur with you thats a pretty good OpEx control. I think our goal is really to be largely flat next year at the ADI level. And what we'll do is in certain cases reprioritize our investments into areas that we're more confident around the growth levels and shift things around as appropriate and not seek to add a lot of resources particularly as we're going to get a whole bunch of resources hopefully by the middle of next year in the form of Linear Tech in place. So that's kind of the goal  it likely means that OpEx normally comes down in the first quarter just because the revenue comes down and then it pops back up in the second quarter if revenue is kind of seasonal, but kind of roughly in these kinds of zip codes, plus or minus $10 million from where we are today. Vincent Roche Needless to say we're operating as two independent businesses till we close. So we're all the time, we're very opportunity-rich as a company and we're all the time looking to pick the best opportunities, make sure they're properly funded, and we're always looking for talents. So within the boundaries of an OpEx model that is spending 18% or 19% in R&D that's what we intend to do and scale it with revenue growth over time. Shankar Iyer Got it. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Kristen Shaka Hi. This is Kristen Shaka for Romit. Congrats on a great quarter guys. Vincent Roche Thank you. Kristen Shaka Just to go back to the consumer segment for a little bit, how did consumer business outside of your largest North American handset customer performed? Dave Zinsner Yes, I can take that one. I would tell you as we enter sort of the back half of the year for ADI the consumer business has some positive seasonality. And so it actually performed quite nicely on a sequential basis and it was about stable to the prior year. So hopefully, that's helpful, and we can get to the next question. Operator Your next question is from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Dave Zinsner Ian, are you there? Ian Ing Yes. Hi, thanks a lot. I believe at one point you gave a full year CapEx target of $140 million to $150 million, you're running below that. Is that because of the Linear deal perhaps getting accessed to some equipment and factory outputs and maybe there's some spending you won't need here? Dave Zinsner No, we're just generally sent a budget that we're going to spend at 4% of revenue in  I think coming into year we thought  we didn't suspect this air pocket we'd run into on the consumer side and so we had a higher expectation on CapEx, but given that the revenue was a bit lower, we lowered the CapEx to this so we could maintain the 4%. Vincent Roche Yes, and so the new numbers somewhere in the range of $130 million to $135 million for the year or so. Ali Husain Thanks, Ian. Good question. Next caller please. Operator Your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin Hi, guys. Thanks for taking for my question. Just given some of the color earlier on some of the growth in your wired infrastructure business because of the 100 gig optical. I was wondering if you could provide some more color on whether that's primarily driven by hyper scale data center customers or if there are some teleco carrier CapEx thats driving that as well? And related to that is looking forward is set pretty much running in line with demand or is there some big element of capacity build ahead or build out for us  for consumption around this year? Thanks. Vincent Roche Yes, good question. It's driven by demand. I think there's a very, very good balance between what we're seeing in terms of demand and supply. There's obviously a huge amount of activity in the intra data center connectivity, and we're participating in that with our customers, also long haul and kind of metro build outs, and I think there's a good balance between the three, but it seems that the data center is hotter at this point in time and looks like it will be a wave for several years to come. So I think it's a good mix and very good balance between demand and supply here. Ali Husain All right, Stephen, thanks. Next caller. Operator Next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse Yes, good morning, thank you for squeezing me in. I guess a quick question around the Linear merger; curious what kind of conversations if any you've had in terms of locking up talent there. And as you think about your compensation plan versus theirs, what are the implications to OpEx going forward? Vincent Roche Well, we're operating as two separate companies until we close and obviously when you look at both companies actually we've had tremendous  we've got tremendously long tenure in both companies and the attrition rates run very, very, very low in both companies. And I expect that to be what it will  that will maintain its pace for many, many years to come. People remain with these companies because we do exciting things. We solve big, big hard problems. We've got very strong cultures. And I believe that just as it was so with Hittite and ADI, it is our goal to make sure that we win the hearts and minds of all of our engineers, who really create the value for both companies, and I'm very confident about that based on the conversations I've so far had with the LTC leadership and I see that as being a tremendous value and strength of both companies. Dave Zinsner And I would say that from an OpEx management perspective we run in this  into this every time we integrate a company there are always slight differences in terms of how the compensation works and I think we're pretty good at figuring out a way that we can do it that works for employees and keep them energized and engaged and simultaneously doesn't have an impact on our total OpEx and our ability to manage our OpEx appropriately. So we haven't worked out the particulars of that and that will also be done over the coming months. But I feel pretty confident that we'll be able to address employees concerns and shareholders concerns and come up with something that's optimal. Ali Husain Thanks C.J. And Okay. So we're past 11:00 AM here Eastern. So that means we have time for one last caller. Operator And our final question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari Hey, good morning and thanks for squeezing me in. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your content win and consumer. Where are you seeing the design wins? How fast is content this year growing relative to last year? And how sustainable is that rate of growth going into next year? Thank you so much. Dave Zinsner Well, as I said the content increases 30%. We can't get into the details. We have confidentiality of our requirements with our customers that don't allow us to go into any more detail other than that. Vincent Roche You know the wins are consistent with our stated strategy. We play in really, really high quality problem areas in the user experience and the wins weve had are very, very consistent with that stated strategy. Ali Husain Okay, great. Well, that was last question. So as a remainder, our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results will be issued on Wednesday, November 22 at 8:00 AM Eastern and the earnings call will began two hours later 10:00 AM Eastern. So that's it from us from Norwood, Massachusetts. And so, thanks for joining us this morning. We will talk to you soon. Operator This concludes todays Analog Devices conference call.

(NASDAQ: ADP ) Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call July 28, 2016, 08:30 ET Executives Sara Grilliot - VP, IR Carlos Rodriguez - President & CEO Jan Siegmund - CFO Analysts James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Christin Chen - Jefferies Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus Rick Eccleston - Wells Fargo Securities Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets Operator Good morning. My name is Andrew and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Fourth Quarter FY 16 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference over to Miss Sara Grilliot, Vice President of Investor or Relations. Please go ahead. Sara Grilliot Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Sara Grilliot, ADP's Vice President Investor Relations and I'm here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP's President and Chief Executive Officer and Jan Siegmund, ADP's Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter FY '16 earnings call and webcast. Before we begin, you may have noticed in the slide presentation posted on our website that we included the detail of our client funds available for sale portfolios as of June 30th, 2016 which shows the embedded book yields of the portfolio by year of maturity. This is chart is in the appendix of the presentation and is provided for your information. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental sides on our Investor Relations website. Before Carlos begins, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filing with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Now let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos Rodriguez Thank you, Sara and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our call and for your continued interest in ADP. This morning we reported solid results for the fourth quarter and full FY '16, with revenue up 8% for the quarter and 7% for the year. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, FY '16 revenue grew 8%. Please keep in mind that our 8% growth in FY '16 was negatively impacted by about 1% from the sale of our AdvancedMD business which occurred at the end of the first fiscal quarter. In addition to the solid FY '16 revenue growth, I'm very pleased with the robust new business bookings results we experienced during FY '16, posting 12% growth for the year. This represents $1.75 billion in new recurring revenue generated by our sales force during the fiscal year. Strong sales of human capital management modules that assist clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act contributed meaningfully to the out performance we've seen in new business bookings for the past two fiscal years. This important regulatory change impacted the ATM industry in material ways. ADP responded well and sold our ACA compliance solutions to about half of our addressable base in a relatively short period of time. Because of this very strong recent performance and the resulting difficult compare, we expect FY '17 new business bookings to grow 4% to 6% from the $1.75 billion sold in FY '16. If achieved this will result in a three year compounded annual growth rate of 9% which is within our long-term expected range of 8% to 10%. FY '16 was an exciting year that showcased ADP's agility as we continued to adapt to the dynamic needs of our clients. When we look back at our progress, it's clear that the long-term trends we see with respect to the changing nature of how work is done, the increasing complexity of regulatory compliance, the trend toward harnessing the power of big data and HR and the need to work seamlessly across geographic boarders are all having positive impacts on our success. We've responded to these trends in many ways during the year. For example, across the portfolio, we've dramatically improved the user experience of our clients' employees. In doing so, we've made our products easier to use and more consistent with how employees engage with consumer technology and social media. If your company is an ADP client, I invite you to join the more than eight million users of ADP's mobile app to experience this for yourself. We've leveraged our unique data set of 26 billion payroll records to introduce significant new data analytics capabilities. Since introducing ADP DataCloud just over one year ago, we now have more than 2500 clients using this solution to generate actionable insights that help address work force productivity, contribute to talent development and assist with employee retention. We've expanded our capabilities geographically and can now meet the payroll processing and compliance needs of companies with operations in more than 110 countries and territories which is a key differentiator in our industry. And we've met the challenges presented by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the U.S. With strong demand for our ACA solutions, we made investments in operational resources and successfully helped more than 25,000 clients process more than 10 million form 1095-Cs, the most significant new employee tax form introduced by the IRS since the W-2. As we've discussed, we believe our investments to innovate and simplify our portfolio are essential for our long-term success. We believe our strategic platforms now deliver best-in-class HCM capabilities in each of the markets they serve and we've seen solid retention rates from clients on our strategic platforms. Therefore, continuing to upgrade clients to our modern cloud solutions remains a critical area of focus for us and is the right thing to do for our clients. Today, all of our small business clients are on the RUN platform and during the fourth quarter we increased the pace of our client migrations in the mid-market and now have about 49,000 clients on the latest versions of Workforce Now. With 2/3 of this base now upgraded, we expect the balance of our Workforce Now clients to be transitioned to the current platform by the end of FY '17. As we continue to move clients onto our strategic platforms and have more clients engaging ADP for multiple services across the HCM spectrum, we're embarking on a path to simplify our service model for our associates and our clients. Over the past several years, our technology platforms have evolved to meet the dynamic needs of our clients, who are choosing to engage in a more comprehensive way with their HCM providers. As a result of this shift, a new approach to service is essential to support the HCM Company that we've become and extend our leadership in this growing market and I'm therefore excited to tell you about a service initiative we're kicking off in FY '17. This new initiative is designed to better align our service organization to work across traditional lines, leverage best-in-class service tools and processes and establish teams with expertise across the HCM spectrum. We believe this will enhance the client experience and at the same time allow us to better transfer knowledge among these service teams and offer robust career opportunities within the service organization, all of which benefits our clients and our associates. As we begin to build out this new service model, we believe there's a benefit to be gained by collocating certain U.S. service capabilities at existing and new ADP locations in the U.S. that have the scale to support the strategy. We have had positive experiences creating centers like these at sites such as El Paso, Texas; Augusta, Georgia; among other places. We've recently selected Norfolk, Virginia and Maitland, Florida, near Orlando, as our next two locations and have started building cross-functional service teams at both sites. We will announce a third new site in the western part of the U.S. later this year. As part of this initiative, we will focus on building service capabilities within these and our existing other locations while streamlining our geographic footprint. In connection with these efforts, ADP will be making certain investments in FY '17 which are expected to put some pressure on our margin expansion goals for the year. Jan will provide more detail when he reviews FY '17 outlook. However, we do expect our margin expansion in FY '17 to be lower than our long-term goal of 50 to 75 basis points as we make these important investments. Now let's spend a few moments on retention. During the fourth quarter, we experienced a retention decline of 80 basis points and for the full fiscal year, retention declined about 1 point to 90.5%. Similar to previous quarters, we continue to see a concentration of losses from clients who are still on legacy technology and while we have seen some of the benefits from investments we've made in service during the early part of FY '16, we continue to experience variability in our retention metric. In closing, FY '16 was an exciting and challenging year for ADP. We achieved strong revenue growth driven by sales of additional HCM modules to support clients with the new ACA requirements. We invested in implementation and operational resources to support this revenue growth while still delivering solid margin expansion and we did this while remaining consistent with our commitment to shareholder-friendly actions. During FY '16, we returned about $2.1 billion in cash through dividends and share repurchases and increased our dividend for the 41st consecutive year. I am confident that as we successfully execute against our strategy, we will continue to drive results for our clients, our associates and our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan who will review our FY '16 financials and share our FY '17 outlook. Jan Siegmund Thank you very much, Carlos and good morning everyone. During the fourth quarter, we took a severance charge of $48 million that was related to a broad-based workforce optimization effort. Certain non-GAAP measures and my commentary to follow exclude the impact of this charge, as well as certain other one-time items recognized earlier in the fiscal year. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental charts of our Investor Relations website. As Carlos mentioned, FY '16 was a successful year for ADP. New business bookings grew 12% to $1.75 billion sold. Revenues grew 7% to $11.7 billion. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, revenues grew 8% for the year. On a reported basis, net earnings grew 8% and diluted earnings per share grew 12%. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT, grew 10% or 11% on a constant dollar basis. For the year, adjusted EBIT margin expanded 60 basis points from the 18.8% in FY '15. I'm pleased with this solid margin expansion which includes the impact of investments and operational resources that were made during the fiscal year as we supported our clients through the first year of the ACA related reporting requirements. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $3.26, reflecting a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. In addition to delivering this solid operating performance, we have paid more than $900 million in dividends and returned about $1.2 billion through share repurchases for FY '16. During the fourth quarter, ADP returned $100 million to shareholders through share repurchases which was at a reduced pace compared with prior quarters. Market conditions were not a factor and our longstanding commitment to return cash to our shareholders remains unchanged. So now, for a discussion of our segment results. In our employee services segment, revenues grew 5% for the year or 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions to new recurring revenues during the fiscal year from strong new business bookings sold. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 80 basis points in the fourth quarter and for the year revenue retention declined about 1 point to 90.5%. Our same-store pace for control in the U.S. grew 2.5% for the fiscal year. Average client fund balances grew 3% for year or 4% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was slower than in prior years, primarily related to the declines of state unemployment insurance collections as the result of an improving labor market in the U.S. This, in combination with the impact from client losses experienced end of the year, has put added pressure on the client funds balance growth. Our business outside of North America continues to perform well despite an uncertain global environment. This performance is driven by continued strong demand for our multinational solutions which serve businesses of all sizes and are now the largest contributor to our sales outside of North America. Employee services segment margin increased about 60 basis points for the fiscal year. This increase was driven by reduced selling expenses in the fourth quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter, partially offset by the negative impact of planned investments made throughout the year to support our clients with the first year of ACA compliance. The PEO had a successful year, posting revenue growth of 16% and average worksite employee growth of 13%. Let me make a few comments about fourth quarter revenue growth in the PEO which trended lower at 13% growth compared with the previous three quarters in FY '16. This revenue growth deceleration was based on two factors. First, regarding our gross revenues which include pass-throughs, our clients experienced a favorable impact from lower healthcare renewal premiums during our fourth quarter which contributed to a lower relative gross in our pass-through revenues. Second, in the fourth quarter we noticed some variability in the timing of payrolls run by our clients. This type of timing variability has occurred in the past and should not be viewed as an indicator of any underlining change in the fundamentals of the business. We remain pleased with the performance of our PEO which had strong worksite employee growth of 13% and we're happy to see that the PEO also delivered strong margin expansion of approximately 70 basis points for FY '16 which was primarily driven by operating and selling efficiencies from increased productivity. This is solid overall performance for FY '16, with strong new business bookings yielding healthy revenue growth and solid margin expansion despite the initial investments we made during the year. I'm pleased with our results and will now take you through our expectations for FY '17. As Carlos mentioned, for FY '17, we're expecting new business bookings growth of 4% to 6%, from $1.75 billion sold in FY '16. We anticipate total revenue growth of 7% to 9% for the year which is not expected to be significantly impacted by foreign currency translation based on current rates. This forecast assumes 4% to 5% revenue growth in the employer services segment and growth in pays-per-control of 2.5%. Revenue growth for the PEO is expected to be 14% to 16%. ADP's adjusted EBIT margin is expected to it expand 25 to 50 basis points from the 19.5% in FY '16 which is below our goal of 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion over the longer run. We're still committed to this margin improvement goal over the longer term, but as Carlos mentioned, we're making investments in FY '17 to align our service model in support of our technology strategy. We expect these operational investments will put about 20 basis points of pressure on our FY '17 margins and as a result of these build-out of the new facilities, total expenditures/capital expenditures for FY '17, I expect it to be about $250 million. In addition to these investments, we also anticipate certain one-time charges of $100 million to $125 million throughout FY '18. Of this, $45 million is expected to be incurred during the first quarter of FY '17 and $45 million in the latter part of the year, with the remainder expected in FY '18. These charges are excluded from our FY '17 forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion and from our adjusted diluted earnings per share forecast. A reconciliation of these metrics can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. On a segment level, we anticipate pretext margin expansion of about 50 basis points for employer services and 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion in the PEO. On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 6% to 8% compared with the $3.25 FY '15. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 10% to 12% from the adjusted $3.26 in FY '16 and contemplates an adjusted effective tax rate of 33.3%, consistent with the 33.3% in FY '16. In accordance to our continued shareholder-friendly actions and our intention to return excess cash to shareholders, our earnings per share forecast assumes that excess cash of $1 billion to $1.4 billion will be returned via share repurchases during FY '17. This forecasted range includes anticipated share repurchases required to offset employee benefit plan issuance and the timing of these share repurchases is dependent upon market conditions. So with that, I will take you through our forecast for the client fund extended investment strategy. First, a reminder that the objectives of our investment strategy remain the safety, liquidity and diversification of our assets. As of the end of the fiscal year, approximately 80% of our fixed income portfolio was invested in AAA and AA-rated securities. In a typical year, our strategy results in about 15% to 20% of our fixed income investments maturing and this year we expect the percentage of maturities will be closer to the lower end of this range. We continue to base the interest rate assumptions in our forecast on the Fed funds future contracts for the clients' short and corporate cash portfolios. And the forward year curves of the three-and-a-half and five-year U.S. government agency forward year curves for the client and corporate extended and the client long portfolios, respectively. And as we do not believe it is possible to accurately predict future interest rates, the shape of the year curve and the new bond issuance behavior are corporate and other issuers. For FY '17, we anticipate growth in the average client funds balances of 2% to 4% from the $22.4 billion in FY '16. We anticipate that the yield of the client fund portfolio will remain about flat at 1.7%, compared with FY '16. These factors are expected to result in an increase of up to $5 million to client fund interest revenue. The total contribution from the client funds extended investment strategy is expected to be about flat to FY '17. The detail of this forecast is available in the supplemental slides on our website. And before we take your questions, I wanted to let you know that Sara will be taking a new role within ADP finance as a CFO of one of our business units. I want to thank Sara for her contributions leading our investor relations program and welcome our new Head of Investor Relations, Christian Greyenbuhl, who was recently -- who has recently led ADP's global accounting team. So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from the line of James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. James Schneider I was wondering if you could maybe give us an update on the migrations in the mid-market segment. I think you said 45,000 had already migrated. It sounds like maybe that's under 40,000 clients to go. Can you maybe talk about any changes you're seeing in terms of, as you make those migrations, whether you're seeing any kind of additional client losses and maybe you can just talk about the pace of migrations over the course of FY '17, whether that's going to be back or front-half loaded or just ratable over the course of the year? Carlos Rodriguez Sure. I think the number was really 49,000 that have been migrated and I think we have about 25,000 to go. In terms of the other questions, you know, we did have some time to kind of reset how we were doing migrations and the pace also based on, you know, I mentioned that there were three factors that I think impacted our retention back over the last three quarters and we think one of them was the pace of migrations and also the execution around migrations. So a lot of work was done during what we call our year-end blackout because we really prefer not to do migrations anyway in the call it November to January, February time frame, because there are so many things going on at the calendar year-end in a typical HCM payroll company. And so that gave us a little bit of time for those folks to focus on kind of stabilizing that organization and rethinking what the proper pace is and to put it in perspective, we migrated approximately 4000 clients during the quarter. And when we experienced challenges with some of the migrations, we were up as high as 7000 in a quarter. This is back in the beginning of this fiscal year. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color and I think the overall comment is clearly I think our competitors are fishing in those waters, because we see it in the numbers in terms of our losses being concentrated in our legacy platforms. And we're trying to reduce the size of the fishing pond, so there's still some variability there in the retention. But I think we've gotten better at how we're doing the migrations and I think our pace is more manageable and I think easier for us to control at this point. Operator Our next question from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is open. Christin Chen This is Christin Chen for Jason. Thank you for taking my question. We were under the impression in FY '16, your bookings growth in excess of the traditional 8% to 10% range was mostly due to ACA. Just looking at the 4% to 6% for FY '17, it would imply a slowdown of, you know, kind of more than just what the tough comps from ACA would imply. Can you just talk about the things you're seeing or the underlying drivers behind that deceleration for this metric? Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez Sure, I will let maybe Jan talk a little about the math, but I think the math does kind of work in within maybe 0.5 point to 1 point, one way or the other depending on your perspective. Because we don't provide exact numbers. But we want to reiterate that we had strong growth in new business bookings this year excluding, ACA. And then mathematically, what that creates is a grow-over for next year. I think I've previously said and we will say today that we don't expect the same level of new business bookings from ACA. Since we've already sold half of our addressable market, even if we assume that we sell half of the remaining half next year, that creates a mathematical grow-over issue for us. I'll let maybe Jan comment on the math. But I think the message you should hear from us is that we believe over the course of three years, as you can imagine, we look very carefully about, is the sales strength coming from core operations, is it coming from additional business, is it coming from ACA and we feel pretty good on a three-year compounded basis about where our new business bookings growth is right now. Jan Siegmund Yes, thank you Carlos. And there are two different methods you can look at this, you could exclude the ACA impact on all three years and look at the underlining growth of the rest of our new business bookings. We would be delivering exactly what we have said are in-line with our long-term goals expectations of 8% to 10% over those three years. And you can also look at is the decline driven by a slowing of ACA sales in FY '17 and that is yes, because we have at rest already half of our business opportunity in the first year and we don't expect to close, cover 100% of the sales opportunity in FY '17. So we had to make assumptions about that and so both are in line within a percentage point plus, minus. So this is for government work, an estimate that keeps it intact. Carlos Rodriguez Yes, I think more government work, again, these are not the right numbers, but mathematically if you take 4% out of the 12% it gives you 8%. And if you add 4% to the 4% to 6%, you get back to 8% to 9% and you're still within the 8% to 10% range. So I hate to be so simplistic, but I think that's really the way the math works. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Sara Gubins The EF guidance for 4% to 5% revenue growth just slower growth in constant currency than what we've been seeing recently, in spite of the ACA bookings that you got this past year. Is that because of retention and could you give us any color on what kind of revenue you did get from ACA last year and what you're expecting for this coming year? Carlos Rodriguez I think that the ES revenue growth has been accelerating for the last five years. And I think some of that obviously is driven by the economy, in terms of as the economy rebounded, I think we had some help in pace per control and a number of other factors and just the strong new business bookings growth has created a bigger gap between our starts, what we call our starts and our losses and I think that has contributed to this accelerating growth in employer services. I think you're right that the losses that we experienced this year obviously have an effect this year and they have an effect on the following year as well. But again, back to kind of simplistic math for government work, I think we're probably plus or minus 0.5 point in terms of ES revenue growth. So maybe some of that is rounding, but we don't feel any weakness, I guess, to be clear. And the ACA revenues, Jan probably has the exact number, that clearly provided lift in our new business bookings and does provide lift to revenues that then also presents somewhat of a grow-over. It's not as pronounced a grow-over, because it's a revenue number versus a new business bookings number, but it does have the same impact. But we feel where we're right now, employer services, feels like a pretty good place in terms of trend and, in terms of trajectory as well. Jan Siegmund And we don't provide, really, the precise revenue numbers, but it's kind of a little bit above, in the $100 million plus range of ACA impact to ADP. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ashish Sabadra This is Ashish Sabadra calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. Just a follow up question on retention. So last quarter, you had mentioned you had taken steps around improving the service capability which gave you some more confidence around retention, but we still saw the retention grow -- or decline. Now my question was when you think about the mid-market customer base you still have 25,000 customers remaining which are going to be migrated over the next four quarters and normally you don't do the migration in November, December which should imply around north of 6,000 customers being migrated every quarter, versus 4,000 that you saw in the last quarter. So with this elevated level of migration, how should we think about retention going forward? Could we see retention get worse before it starts to get better? Any clarity that you can provide on the retention front, that will be helpful. Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez Sure, it's a good question, it's a fair question. I think your math is actually very close, the only thing I would add to that math is that, you know, you do have to apply a retention -- or a loss factor to that 25,000 itself over the course of 12 months. We naturally, even if we weren't migrating, would lose call it 10% of those clients. It might be a little bit higher than that, just because they're legacy type clients. The absolute number you're starting with that you have to divide over four quarters is a little bit smaller. But you're in the right ballpark. It's probably around 5000 or so clients that need to be migrated per quarter. We feel pretty comfortable with that pace, given the infrastructure that we've created and the new process we have for migrations. In terms of additional color, as you're pointing out, the results didn't cooperate with our desires and with our intentions and in part, that's because our retention is a reflection of the overall Company's results and there's variability across a lot of other businesses. I wouldn't read in to it, even though we still have a concentration of our retentions issues in the mid-market and they have been for this fiscal year. There is another $8 billion to $9 billion of revenue in ADP that also experiences variability in retention. But having said that to give you specifics around, you know, why our confidence level was high that things would get better and why it still remains high, we have a number of, in specifically the mid-market, issues that we were experiencing with rewards to retention. We have a lot of metrics, as you can imagine, that we look at that are leading indicators versus retention which is a lagging indicator. For example, the speed to answer phone calls, number of cases that are unresolved in a backlog, we have a number of escalations in terms of people escalating client service issues and the metrics are -- most of the metrics in the mid-market regarding service experience for our clients are either back to where they were prior to our retention issues or in some cases better. So we feel confident that even if there's some kind of lag in the sense that some clients may have already been in process due to a poor service experience of looking at alternatives and the fact that there are other parts of ADP that have variability and retention as well, I think not withstanding all those things, I think my confidence in the improvements in service, stability and service experience in the mid-market remain quite high actually. Jan Siegmund And if I add a more technical comment, relative to our losses that we see over the fiscal year, we have cyclicality in our loss volumes and so year-end -- calendar year-end on the third quarter for us, fiscal year -- are traditionally higher loss months and the fourth quarter month is a lower loss months. So hence, there can be variability in the quarterly shifts of the retention numbers and this case it impacted a relatively low loss volume that we typically experience in the fourth quarter. So my general council would be to observe those retention changes that we report, but not to get overly analytical and mathematical quarter-by-quarter. It is a better indicator to think about basically our retention number of 100 basis points decline. So in the fiscal year, in closing, we're aiming to be better. We don't guide to retention, but as you might imagine as a Company, we clearly have aspirations to improve. Operator Our next question from the line of David Grossman from Stifel Financial. Your line is open. David Grossman I wonder if I could ask a question about the margin guidance. I think you gave us some good color on what the headwinds were going to be into FY '17, but if I understood you right, but if I understood you right there's about 20 basis points of incremental headwinds over and above what you're isolating as nonrecurring. Perhaps you could give us more insight in to, you know, what those incremental charges are and when you bundle everything together, you know, as you come out of FY '17, how should we look at how the model has changed and how the leverage in the model changes beyond FY '17? Jan Siegmund So as we described, our initiative is really to create more concentrated centers of excellence and strategic locations and we indicate basically five big cities that we're doing. So as a consequence, approximately 5% of our employee population is going to be transferring or moving or the work will be moving and impacting about 5% of our associate population in this fiscal year. And there are costs that are related to this which are which we're non-GAAPing which are related in essence to employee costs to facilitate the transfer of the work that is basically included in the 20 basis points of our guidance. We clearly hope that the outcome of this service alignment initiative is multi-folded. I believe strongly it will enhance our service valuable proposition, because we're going to have larger centers with bigger capabilities, leveraging ADP's strength and compliance in service and offering a better value proposition to our clients which is the most exciting part for this service alignment initiative. Hopefully resulting in better competitiveness and higher retention rates and also as you can see, these centers are located in geographies of the U.S. that offer certain advantages, relative to the cost where they operate, so that we should be in the longer run also contribution to our margins. We're a little bit hesitant to specify this for 2018 because the initiative will actually bleed over in to FY '18, we mentioned in particular the center and investors West is going to come later in 2017 and will bleed over 2018. So 2018 will still have some impact, but we're clearly hoping that it will guarantee basically that we can fulfill our commitment to the 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion in the long run, so this is an important supporting initiative for that. Carlos Rodriguez And David, I think you're right, the 20 basis points is above what we've put in quote, unquote the non-GAAP numbers. And I think, you know, that's just a frictional cost. They are identified. We know what those costs are and they are costed. It's not appropriate to bucket into the non-GAAP charges, I guess is the best way to put it. I'm not, obviously, the accountant, but I think your math is or your comment was spot on. So that's the, when we provided that color to give you more information to be able to come up with what you might think might be the longer term potential performance of the Company which as Jan said, we're optimistic about. And I think we're doing these things, you know, really there's two things that we're always focused on, service experience, the client experience from our service organization and implementation and just the operations of the organizational role and our competitiveness and our efficiency. I would call this a large initiative and a complex initiative that hopefully is coming across with the significance that it should and it's multi-year. David Grossman And can I ask just one follow up on just the CapEx comment at well. So it sounds like CapEx is over $2 million related to this, so is there anything we should think differently about the year-over-year growth and pre-cash flow in FY '17? Carlos Rodriguez I'll let, maybe Jan can comment a little more on the CapEx. We weren't implying that the entire CapEx was because of this initiative. We have normal ongoing normal CapEx. It's just trending higher than it has historically. So wanted to make sure that we put that out there. But I do want to comment, besides Jan giving you the specifics on the numbers, that we're investing in this Company. So this Company has an industry that has positive global dynamics in terms of growth. We just saw it with ACA in the U.S. We're going to see it with FLSA and the EEOC equity pay rules and we're seeing the same thing in other countries. And so this Company has opportunity. And we intend to invest in order to seize those opportunities. And so I think what you're seeing is our investment in CapEx and frankly also our investment in capitalized software which we disclosed but is not something that we necessarily always focus on, are all trending higher. And we take the deployment of capital very, very seriously as you know. But people should not mistake what our actions are for anything other than optimism about the future and the potential for these investments to have incremental returns for our shareholders over the long-term. Jan Siegmund I have really only two comments to add is, so there's a temporarily higher capital expenditure rate and the increase is to the very largest amount driven by investments into our real estate project to get these facilities up and going. And related investments for this initiative. And secondly, I'd like also to remind you that ADP has pursued over the last couple of years a growth strategy that is more focused on our organic growth capabilities, focusing on investments into our own product set and focusing in this initiative on enhancing and developing additional market-leading service capabilities. So I think it's right in line with how the strategy has worked for ADP and it's really quite an exciting moment for ADP. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Rick Eccleston from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Rick Eccleston I wonder if we could go back on the new service initiative. Just kind of see if you could tie it in to the investments that you've made earlier in the delivery side, what informed this and how related or not was it to the service delivery issues and investments that you had earlier and just tie those two together. Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez So I'll make a comment and then Jan I think can add. I really appreciate the question because they are, actually, quite separate topics. As though the service delivery issues that we experienced were concentrated in a particular part of our business in the mid-market and they were execution related. And I think what we're talking about in terms of our new service alignment initiative is a broad strategic objective across the entire Company. It's partly driven by the fact that the industry has evolved and I think the clients need to have evolved and the products have evolved. So as an example,10 years ago, having three or four different products that were serviced differently and different databases was not an issue. Our platforms now are single-database integrated solutions that provide an HCM solution if a client wants to buy it that way, in a comprehensive and seamless way. The service model had not moved in the same direction. And I think that this initiative is really intended to have our service and implementation really align with the way the market is going, the way buyers are buying and the way clients want to be serviced. So we've done similar things in our sales organization where that also requires that our sales force be trained and equipped to be able to sell in the new environment. So our belief is that now we will have our products, our service and our distribution all aligned. Jan Siegmund And I think it is probably the best way to connect our focus on creating competitive technology platforms that are cloud-based and integrated as a prerequisite to create the integrated service model, so we have made really A, great progress with these strategic platforms, but B, also migrated now large numbers of clients on to these platforms. So it really does make good sense at this point in time to launch the service alignment initiative. And as you might imagine, we did have, we have tested these service models and components of our organization at smaller scale. And we have seen great results out of those pilots. Rick Eccleston And then if I could just quickly follow up, Jan, on the comment you made earlier about how you've been making more organic investments. Has anything changed just in general in terms of your portfolio shaping, any sort of divestitures, small ones to come and how are you approaching M&A currently? Thank you. Jan Siegmund The, no I think our principal stand on M&A has not changed. We have a very solid balanced sheet, we have the capital to investment in the industry and we continue to evaluate opportunities, but we evaluate M&A opportunities in light of our strategic priorities which is -- which are focused at this point in time on reduction of complexity and aligning and focus on our client needs. So any acquisitions that support that drive, what we will actively and aggressively pursue. But it has played out over the last three years to a more organic growth pattern that has seen great results. And so I think that stand stays the same. I would not expect any dramatic shift in our attitude towards M&A, from what you have seen in the last three years. And relative to divestitures and adjusting the portfolio, I think the large portfolio alignment initiatives have happened, with the spinoff of CDK and I think our larger, last larger divestiture was advanced. There will be here and there smaller type of things as we continually to evaluate the performance of our product portfolio and if we see opportunities to enhance shareholder value, we will pursue it as we have done so in the past. But it's really, in essence, I would anticipate FY '17 to run under the same guide polls as in the last three years. Carlos Rodriguez I think Jan's absolutely right on all those points. I would just add that back to the discussion about capital and the seriousness with which we take capital deployment, we do have a strong balance sheet so we have capital we can deploy. But as Jan said, you know, consumptionally if something really fit into our technology roadmap and accelerated our progress, we'd use our capital. But we're not going to use our capital to have something that, for lack of a better term, sits next to everything else that we have. So it has to be able to be integrated rapidly and seamlessly into what we already are pursuing in terms of our product strategy. That's a little bit of a departure from, call it six, seven years ago when it was really more about leveraging our distribution and adding capabilities and products without as much, necessarily, regard to how they fit tightly into the technology road map. And that's really not so much a change in strategy. It's a change in the market and the way people want to buy and the way products behave which makes it very, very important to have tight alignment and seamlessness in your products. And then the last just factual comment I'll make to Jan's point, is we -- because we have capital, if something accelerated our progress, we would do it no different than we're doing some of these internal organic things that we're investing in to accelerate our progress. So if there's an external opportunity to use our capital, we would. But the fact is that over the last couple years, when you look at the balance of capital deployment, Jan and I have this discussion all the time, we haven't consciously avoided doing acquisitions. It's just been harder to find ones that make sense and fit in what we're doing in terms of our strategy. But net-net when you get down to it, we're spending, call it $300 million to $400 million less on acquisitions and we're spending more on things like internally developed products, capital expenditures and the investments that we 're talking about for FY '17. So it wasn't necessarily planned that way, but it just so happens that, you know, we 're not necessarily deploying any more capital, but we 're just deploying it in a slightly different way. But we do retain the right to deploy capital towards acquisitions as well. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon Just wondering if you could just add a little more color in terms of the service realignment, in terms of, you know, how clients may end up being serviced? Is it -- you know, is there going to be a transition to like a dedicated service rap for the mid-market? What did you see out of the pilot studies and what's the -- what's the reaction internally, you know, with some of the service providers in terms of potentially geographically relocating? Carlos Rodriguez It's a great question. We'll give you a little bit of color and then maybe Jan can add in terms of what he's hearing out in the field. It's interesting the term dedicated reps, because we do have parts of our business, obviously in the up-market and national accounts, we have very specific people that service specific clients. And then when you get in the small business market, we tend to have a model where, you know, the execution and the delivery is very important, but the person that you reach is not as important. We believe that's the right model. We believe our retention rates and our growth in the small business market prove that our model works as long as you execute well and we would also argue that in today's world, having a dedicated rep who works eight hours a day might not be the best service model for a small company or any other company. So we prefer to focus on how -- what's the best way to deliver the best service to the client in the way they want it delivered. And it varies from small business up to the up-market in terms of whether you need a dedicated person or not, but I would encourage you to kind of visualize this service realignment as being more around teams rather than dedicated people, so having alignment around teams. So as an example, given the attach rates that we've discussed over multiple quarters that we're experiencing now in the mid-market and in the up-market, around additional HCM modules -- in other words, clients are rarely buying just payroll by itself or just benefits administration by itself. So this service model really is intended to be able to provide a group of people or a team of people who work together, who are collocated and can deliver service across the entire HCM spectrum. That obviously requires some cross-training, but also some ability for people who have special skills to be available and close to people who need to support our clients on a multiple number of issues. So we have a reasonable amount of experience in experimenting with what we call intact teams or with collocated teams and we feel good about the results when it comes to retention, when to comes to client satisfaction and by the way in our business, when you have those two things, margin follows. So this is primarily led by quality and experience for the client and also by the way, opportunity for our associates. So what we have found also is in some of our subscale locations, there's very, very limited mobility and opportunity for associates to progress from a career standpoint.  And we now have a number of opportunities across our business for people to learn new things and to move into different areas, whether it's time and attendance and pay roll, benefits administration, talent management, we really run the whole gamut on HCM and we needs across the entire business and when we have people scattered across the entire country in small subscale locations, it just doesn't I think make sense from a talent management standpoint for ourselves, internally either. And so on all those fronts, we think that this service alignment strategy makes sense. Jan Siegmund Carlos mentioned most of the factors. I would add, too, we have seen a rise in our associate engagement scores as a consequence for those who work in those intact teams. And it reflects probably better of how in a modern team environment our associates want to work. So that's really exciting for our associates as well. And one additional component that a strategic move on locations allows you to plan for is also a coordinated effort between our market segments, small, medium and large. So I think we mentioned it in the call. So now we have collocation between those market segments and there can be natural growth and exchange of best practices between the different platforms. And for some of the platforms, the back end is fairly similar. If you think about sender-self excellence for our tax filing operation and so forth, so it allows us also to create buckets of scale that are very hard to create in smaller locations. So it really, I believe, will transform of how associates be perceiving A, the value of the job they're in and the job opportunities then that can reach in the future and allows us to deliver additional service capabilities to our clients which is the strategic benefit that we're reaping out of it. Mark Marcon Certainly seems to make a lot of sense. I applaud you for taking this long-term step. Can you talk also with regards to the expectation for new bookings growth, where you would expect to see the strongest growth in terms of which areas? Jan Siegmund Yes, I'll take this right on -- if you look at FY '16, we had actually fairly balanced growth across the business. We had great performance really along all segments and continued strength in multinational, great performance really across all segments. Maybe the only spot that has been a little bit harder was Europe as you might imagine and our best of breed solutions, but that was really more than balanced by good demand from multinational solutions. So when we look at the plan, other than specific grow-over challenges that we had because ACA cells were concentrated in the mid-market and in the up-market. If you take that out it's really each of the business units continues with very good performance and just as a reminder, it was $1.75 billion of recurring revenue that sales force generated for ADP and even if the growth is a few percentage points slower, this kind of still a very significant number. Operator Our last question for today will be coming from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC. Your line is open. Gary Bisbee I wanted to go back to an earlier question, just around the concept of revenue acceleration. So you've had two years of above-trend bookings, you've got pace for control continuing to click along at a similar pace, you had a drag this year from selling a business that will no longer be a drag in 2017 and you know, retention was a drag, I guess you're not saying specifically, but maybe still a drag, but it sounds like a lesser one potentially in 2017. So why don't -- you've always said the current-year bookings don't do a lot to revenue. Why wouldn't we see some acceleration? Is it as simple as PEO? You're calling for that to be slower? It just feels like there should be a bit better revenue growth from, you know, thinking through all these moving parts. Thank you. Jan Siegmund Yes, the math is how the math is going to work out between the starts that we have sold and the retention and there's really no change in how we have built our business models over time. We did have a little bit of unusual revenue skewing that created the more revenue acceleration, I guess, in this year than for next year which contributes a little bit to the thing. But if you -- if you take that into account, there's really nothing that unusual in next year's revenue growth. Carlos Rodriguez Yes and I think that all the things you mentioned it's important to acknowledge what you said. We do, again even though we don't give specific guidance, we do expect less of a drag for example from retentions, because we expect things to get better. We have some metrics and some things underlying, I think, data that give us hope at least, right? Because we don't know for sure that will improve your math, the comments you made about new the business bookings, all those things are correct. I think I would just encourage you to maybe spend some time offline with us in terms of kind of the math and how the revenue works. One of the interesting things about this business, this is an incredibly stable and predictable business model. It's also very, very hard to move the numbers dramatically one way or the other over the course of one year. So over the course of four or five years, we've had double digit new business bookings and this year we had a blip with retention. But retention's also been fairly stable. That's allowed us to accelerate our revenue growth about 1/2 to 1 percentage point from, call it five years ago, in employer services. The PEO, as you said, also happens to be a factor because it's growing faster and it's becoming a larger portion of the overall results. So if it slows slightly that has an impact, too. So we'll spend the time to make sure we do the math, but what I can tell you is that you're right, that this year, if you exclude the impact of the divestiture or if you don't factor the divestiture in, we were close to 9% revenue growth. We're really proud of that. And next year we're slightly below that because there's one day less, because this year was a leap year or whatever the issues are and we have a drag still from, even though retention's getting better, it's still not as good as it used to be. We're still going to be pretty damn happy and pretty damn proud, because we're going to be in I think still, in the high end of our guidance from a revenue standpoint. And in this business, when you get into that range, given who we're, in terms of because we understand, we have very keen insight into who we're, like as a company in terms of where we want to be, in terms of our growth rates and our margin improvement and the balance of those things, I think we're, I think satisfied with that outcome. It obviously makes it easier as you pick up additional revenue growth because of the nice leverageability of our operating model. But, you know, that's part of why we're also doing some of the things we 're doing around service alignment, because we know that we're really not, I think satisfied with just the results that we have today. On the other hand, we're not going to sit here and tell you that we're trying to aim for 10%, 12%, 15% revenue growth because that's really not who we're. So 7% to 9% is our long-term guidance for revenue growth, with some margin improvement, with a healthy dividend, with share buybacks, that's our model, that's what we're executing against. And I'm proud of the Organization and the results they delivered this year. And I think if we deliver the results that we've put out there for next year, we're going to be just as proud of that as well. Gary Bisbee Okay, great. And then if I could add just one quick follow up. On the ACA product, how much of the revenue would be charged for sending out like the 1095 forms and what not versus -- I assume there's some ongoing revenue related to the analytics and compliance tool-- Jan Siegmund Yes, this allows me to make another pitch for our fantastic and very differentiated ACA product. It is actually far more than just sending out 1095 and 1094 forms. It is really a compliance service that we offer, that ongoing offers -- ongoing monitoring and assessment services for eligibility and affordability. And also which is really very differentiated in this market, offers what we call notice management services at the back-end to react to agency and exchange notices and keep the company in compliance with those, that's where a bulk of the fines can actually incur. So we build our clients on a per-employee per month basis. So the revenue stream is actually not concentrated on a specific form delivery, it's an annualized recurring revenue. And so you should think about the revenues exactly the same way you think about the rest of ADP. Operator Thank you. This concludes our question and answer session for today. I'm pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez Thanks. This is our 67th year and where we've combined world class operations with innovative products and services that meet the dynamic needs of our clients. This was never more evident than in 2016 and I'm proud of the success of our business in getting the solutions to market to meet those needs of the clients and if I can get on my soap box for a second, I mentioned previously that ADP -- this is ADP's 41st consecutive year of paying and increasing our dividend. And as a dividend aristocrat, ADP is one of just over 50 companies in the S&P 500 who have paid an increase of dividend for more than 25 years. Now with some of the things we're talking about for FY '17, ADP leaders and associates are making the investments to lay the foundation for ADP to join the dividend royals in nine years. And that's a list of just 17 companies who have paid and increased their dividend for more than 50 years. Any student of business knows that only the most durable and enduring icons of business make either list. This success is entirely attributable to the hard work and dedication of our associates, who commit themselves every day to ensuring our clients' success. So to them and to all before them, I say thank you. And I thank you all for joining the call today and for your interest in ADP. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes today's conference.

We will take our first question from the line of James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. James Schneider I was wondering if you could maybe give us an update on the migrations in the mid-market segment. I think you said 45,000 had already migrated. It sounds like maybe that's under 40,000 clients to go. Can you maybe talk about any changes you're seeing in terms of, as you make those migrations, whether you're seeing any kind of additional client losses and maybe you can just talk about the pace of migrations over the course of FY '17, whether that's going to be back or front-half loaded or just ratable over the course of the year? Carlos Rodriguez Sure. I think the number was really 49,000 that have been migrated and I think we have about 25,000 to go. In terms of the other questions, you know, we did have some time to kind of reset how we were doing migrations and the pace also based on, you know, I mentioned that there were three factors that I think impacted our retention back over the last three quarters and we think one of them was the pace of migrations and also the execution around migrations. So a lot of work was done during what we call our year-end blackout because we really prefer not to do migrations anyway in the call it November to January, February time frame, because there are so many things going on at the calendar year-end in a typical HCM payroll company. And so that gave us a little bit of time for those folks to focus on kind of stabilizing that organization and rethinking what the proper pace is and to put it in perspective, we migrated approximately 4000 clients during the quarter. And when we experienced challenges with some of the migrations, we were up as high as 7000 in a quarter. This is back in the beginning of this fiscal year. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color and I think the overall comment is clearly I think our competitors are fishing in those waters, because we see it in the numbers in terms of our losses being concentrated in our legacy platforms. And we're trying to reduce the size of the fishing pond, so there's still some variability there in the retention. But I think we've gotten better at how we're doing the migrations and I think our pace is more manageable and I think easier for us to control at this point. Operator Our next question from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is open. Christin Chen This is Christin Chen for Jason. Thank you for taking my question. We were under the impression in FY '16, your bookings growth in excess of the traditional 8% to 10% range was mostly due to ACA. Just looking at the 4% to 6% for FY '17, it would imply a slowdown of, you know, kind of more than just what the tough comps from ACA would imply. Can you just talk about the things you're seeing or the underlying drivers behind that deceleration for this metric? Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez Sure, I will let maybe Jan talk a little about the math, but I think the math does kind of work in within maybe 0.5 point to 1 point, one way or the other depending on your perspective. Because we don't provide exact numbers. But we want to reiterate that we had strong growth in new business bookings this year excluding, ACA. And then mathematically, what that creates is a grow-over for next year. I think I've previously said and we will say today that we don't expect the same level of new business bookings from ACA. Since we've already sold half of our addressable market, even if we assume that we sell half of the remaining half next year, that creates a mathematical grow-over issue for us. I'll let maybe Jan comment on the math. But I think the message you should hear from us is that we believe over the course of three years, as you can imagine, we look very carefully about, is the sales strength coming from core operations, is it coming from additional business, is it coming from ACA and we feel pretty good on a three-year compounded basis about where our new business bookings growth is right now. Jan Siegmund Yes, thank you Carlos. And there are two different methods you can look at this, you could exclude the ACA impact on all three years and look at the underlining growth of the rest of our new business bookings. We would be delivering exactly what we have said are in-line with our long-term goals expectations of 8% to 10% over those three years. And you can also look at is the decline driven by a slowing of ACA sales in FY '17 and that is yes, because we have at rest already half of our business opportunity in the first year and we don't expect to close, cover 100% of the sales opportunity in FY '17. So we had to make assumptions about that and so both are in line within a percentage point plus, minus. So this is for government work, an estimate that keeps it intact. Carlos Rodriguez Yes, I think more government work, again, these are not the right numbers, but mathematically if you take 4% out of the 12% it gives you 8%. And if you add 4% to the 4% to 6%, you get back to 8% to 9% and you're still within the 8% to 10% range. So I hate to be so simplistic, but I think that's really the way the math works. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Sara Gubins The EF guidance for 4% to 5% revenue growth just slower growth in constant currency than what we've been seeing recently, in spite of the ACA bookings that you got this past year. Is that because of retention and could you give us any color on what kind of revenue you did get from ACA last year and what you're expecting for this coming year? Carlos Rodriguez I think that the ES revenue growth has been accelerating for the last five years. And I think some of that obviously is driven by the economy, in terms of as the economy rebounded, I think we had some help in pace per control and a number of other factors and just the strong new business bookings growth has created a bigger gap between our starts, what we call our starts and our losses and I think that has contributed to this accelerating growth in employer services. I think you're right that the losses that we experienced this year obviously have an effect this year and they have an effect on the following year as well. But again, back to kind of simplistic math for government work, I think we're probably plus or minus 0.5 point in terms of ES revenue growth. So maybe some of that is rounding, but we don't feel any weakness, I guess, to be clear. And the ACA revenues, Jan probably has the exact number, that clearly provided lift in our new business bookings and does provide lift to revenues that then also presents somewhat of a grow-over. It's not as pronounced a grow-over, because it's a revenue number versus a new business bookings number, but it does have the same impact. But we feel where we're right now, employer services, feels like a pretty good place in terms of trend and, in terms of trajectory as well. Jan Siegmund And we don't provide, really, the precise revenue numbers, but it's kind of a little bit above, in the $100 million plus range of ACA impact to ADP. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ashish Sabadra This is Ashish Sabadra calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. Just a follow up question on retention. So last quarter, you had mentioned you had taken steps around improving the service capability which gave you some more confidence around retention, but we still saw the retention grow -- or decline. Now my question was when you think about the mid-market customer base you still have 25,000 customers remaining which are going to be migrated over the next four quarters and normally you don't do the migration in November, December which should imply around north of 6,000 customers being migrated every quarter, versus 4,000 that you saw in the last quarter. So with this elevated level of migration, how should we think about retention going forward? Could we see retention get worse before it starts to get better? Any clarity that you can provide on the retention front, that will be helpful. Thanks. Carlos Rodriguez Sure, it's a good question, it's a fair question. I think your math is actually very close, the only thing I would add to that math is that, you know, you do have to apply a retention -- or a loss factor to that 25,000 itself over the course of 12 months. We naturally, even if we weren't migrating, would lose call it 10% of those clients. It might be a little bit higher than that, just because they're legacy type clients. The absolute number you're starting with that you have to divide over four quarters is a little bit smaller. But you're in the right ballpark. It's probably around 5000 or so clients that need to be migrated per quarter. We feel pretty comfortable with that pace, given the infrastructure that we've created and the new process we have for migrations. In terms of additional color, as you're pointing out, the results didn't cooperate with our desires and with our intentions and in part, that's because our retention is a reflection of the overall Company's results and there's variability across a lot of other businesses. I wouldn't read in to it, even though we still have a concentration of our retentions issues in the mid-market and they have been for this fiscal year. There is another $8 billion to $9 billion of revenue in ADP that also experiences variability in retention. But having said that to give you specifics around, you know, why our confidence level was high that things would get better and why it still remains high, we have a number of, in specifically the mid-market, issues that we were experiencing with rewards to retention. We have a lot of metrics, as you can imagine, that we look at that are leading indicators versus retention which is a lagging indicator. For example, the speed to answer phone calls, number of cases that are unresolved in a backlog, we have a number of escalations in terms of people escalating client service issues and the metrics are -- most of the metrics in the mid-market regarding service experience for our clients are either back to where they were prior to our retention issues or in some cases better. So we feel confident that even if there's some kind of lag in the sense that some clients may have already been in process due to a poor service experience of looking at alternatives and the fact that there are other parts of ADP that have variability and retention as well, I think not withstanding all those things, I think my confidence in the improvements in service, stability and service experience in the mid-market remain quite high actually. Jan Siegmund And if I add a more technical comment, relative to our losses that we see over the fiscal year, we have cyclicality in our loss volumes and so year-end -- calendar year-end on the third quarter for us, fiscal year -- are traditionally higher loss months and the fourth quarter month is a lower loss months. So hence, there can be variability in the quarterly shifts of the retention numbers and this case it impacted a relatively low loss volume that we typically experience in the fourth quarter. So my general council would be to observe those retention changes that we report, but not to get overly analytical and mathematical quarter-by-quarter. It is a better indicator to think about basically our retention number of 100 basis points decline. So in the fiscal year, in closing, we're aiming to be better. We don't guide to retention, but as you might imagine as a Company, we clearly have aspirations to improve. Operator Our next question from the line of David Grossman from Stifel Financial. Your line is open. David Grossman I wonder if I could ask a question about the margin guidance. I think you gave us some good color on what the headwinds were going to be into FY '17, but if I understood you right, but if I understood you right there's about 20 basis points of incremental headwinds over and above what you're isolating as nonrecurring. Perhaps you could give us more insight in to, you know, what those incremental charges are and when you bundle everything together, you know, as you come out of FY '17, how should we look at how the model has changed and how the leverage in the model changes beyond FY '17? Jan Siegmund So as we described, our initiative is really to create more concentrated centers of excellence and strategic locations and we indicate basically five big cities that we're doing. So as a consequence, approximately 5% of our employee population is going to be transferring or moving or the work will be moving and impacting about 5% of our associate population in this fiscal year. And there are costs that are related to this which are which we're non-GAAPing which are related in essence to employee costs to facilitate the transfer of the work that is basically included in the 20 basis points of our guidance. We clearly hope that the outcome of this service alignment initiative is multi-folded. I believe strongly it will enhance our service valuable proposition, because we're going to have larger centers with bigger capabilities, leveraging ADP's strength and compliance in service and offering a better value proposition to our clients which is the most exciting part for this service alignment initiative. Hopefully resulting in better competitiveness and higher retention rates and also as you can see, these centers are located in geographies of the U.S. that offer certain advantages, relative to the cost where they operate, so that we should be in the longer run also contribution to our margins. We're a little bit hesitant to specify this for 2018 because the initiative will actually bleed over in to FY '18, we mentioned in particular the center and investors West is going to come later in 2017 and will bleed over 2018. So 2018 will still have some impact, but we're clearly hoping that it will guarantee basically that we can fulfill our commitment to the 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion in the long run, so this is an important supporting initiative for that. Carlos Rodriguez And David, I think you're right, the 20 basis points is above what we've put in quote, unquote the non-GAAP numbers. And I think, you know, that's just a frictional cost. They are identified. We know what those costs are and they are costed. It's not appropriate to bucket into the non-GAAP charges, I guess is the best way to put it. I'm not, obviously, the accountant, but I think your math is or your comment was spot on. So that's the, when we provided that color to give you more information to be able to come up with what you might think might be the longer term potential performance of the Company which as Jan said, we're optimistic about. And I think we're doing these things, you know, really there's two things that we're always focused on, service experience, the client experience from our service organization and implementation and just the operations of the organizational role and our competitiveness and our efficiency. I would call this a large initiative and a complex initiative that hopefully is coming across with the significance that it should and it's multi-year. David Grossman And can I ask just one follow up on just the CapEx comment at well. So it sounds like CapEx is over $2 million related to this, so is there anything we should think differently about the year-over-year growth and pre-cash flow in FY '17? Carlos Rodriguez I'll let, maybe Jan can comment a little more on the CapEx. We weren't implying that the entire CapEx was because of this initiative. We have normal ongoing normal CapEx. It's just trending higher than it has historically. So wanted to make sure that we put that out there. But I do want to comment, besides Jan giving you the specifics on the numbers, that we're investing in this Company. So this Company has an industry that has positive global dynamics in terms of growth. We just saw it with ACA in the U.S. We're going to see it with FLSA and the EEOC equity pay rules and we're seeing the same thing in other countries. And so this Company has opportunity. And we intend to invest in order to seize those opportunities. And so I think what you're seeing is our investment in CapEx and frankly also our investment in capitalized software which we disclosed but is not something that we necessarily always focus on, are all trending higher. And we take the deployment of capital very, very seriously as you know. But people should not mistake what our actions are for anything other than optimism about the future and the potential for these investments to have incremental returns for our shareholders over the long-term. Jan Siegmund I have really only two comments to add is, so there's a temporarily higher capital expenditure rate and the increase is to the very largest amount driven by investments into our real estate project to get these facilities up and going. And related investments for this initiative. And secondly, I'd like also to remind you that ADP has pursued over the last couple of years a growth strategy that is more focused on our organic growth capabilities, focusing on investments into our own product set and focusing in this initiative on enhancing and developing additional market-leading service capabilities. So I think it's right in line with how the strategy has worked for ADP and it's really quite an exciting moment for ADP. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Rick Eccleston from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Rick Eccleston I wonder if we could go back on the new service initiative. Just kind of see if you could tie it in to the investments that you've made earlier in the delivery side, what informed this and how related or not was it to the service delivery issues and investments that you had earlier and just tie those two together. Thank you. Carlos Rodriguez So I'll make a comment and then Jan I think can add. I really appreciate the question because they are, actually, quite separate topics. As though the service delivery issues that we experienced were concentrated in a particular part of our business in the mid-market and they were execution related. And I think what we're talking about in terms of our new service alignment initiative is a broad strategic objective across the entire Company. It's partly driven by the fact that the industry has evolved and I think the clients need to have evolved and the products have evolved. So as an example,10 years ago, having three or four different products that were serviced differently and different databases was not an issue. Our platforms now are single-database integrated solutions that provide an HCM solution if a client wants to buy it that way, in a comprehensive and seamless way. The service model had not moved in the same direction. And I think that this initiative is really intended to have our service and implementation really align with the way the market is going, the way buyers are buying and the way clients want to be serviced. So we've done similar things in our sales organization where that also requires that our sales force be trained and equipped to be able to sell in the new environment. So our belief is that now we will have our products, our service and our distribution all aligned. Jan Siegmund And I think it is probably the best way to connect our focus on creating competitive technology platforms that are cloud-based and integrated as a prerequisite to create the integrated service model, so we have made really A, great progress with these strategic platforms, but B, also migrated now large numbers of clients on to these platforms. So it really does make good sense at this point in time to launch the service alignment initiative. And as you might imagine, we did have, we have tested these service models and components of our organization at smaller scale. And we have seen great results out of those pilots. Rick Eccleston And then if I could just quickly follow up, Jan, on the comment you made earlier about how you've been making more organic investments. Has anything changed just in general in terms of your portfolio shaping, any sort of divestitures, small ones to come and how are you approaching M&A currently? Thank you. Jan Siegmund The, no I think our principal stand on M&A has not changed. We have a very solid balanced sheet, we have the capital to investment in the industry and we continue to evaluate opportunities, but we evaluate M&A opportunities in light of our strategic priorities which is -- which are focused at this point in time on reduction of complexity and aligning and focus on our client needs. So any acquisitions that support that drive, what we will actively and aggressively pursue. But it has played out over the last three years to a more organic growth pattern that has seen great results. And so I think that stand stays the same. I would not expect any dramatic shift in our attitude towards M&A, from what you have seen in the last three years. And relative to divestitures and adjusting the portfolio, I think the large portfolio alignment initiatives have happened, with the spinoff of CDK and I think our larger, last larger divestiture was advanced. There will be here and there smaller type of things as we continually to evaluate the performance of our product portfolio and if we see opportunities to enhance shareholder value, we will pursue it as we have done so in the past. But it's really, in essence, I would anticipate FY '17 to run under the same guide polls as in the last three years. Carlos Rodriguez I think Jan's absolutely right on all those points. I would just add that back to the discussion about capital and the seriousness with which we take capital deployment, we do have a strong balance sheet so we have capital we can deploy. But as Jan said, you know, consumptionally if something really fit into our technology roadmap and accelerated our progress, we'd use our capital. But we're not going to use our capital to have something that, for lack of a better term, sits next to everything else that we have. So it has to be able to be integrated rapidly and seamlessly into what we already are pursuing in terms of our product strategy. That's a little bit of a departure from, call it six, seven years ago when it was really more about leveraging our distribution and adding capabilities and products without as much, necessarily, regard to how they fit tightly into the technology road map. And that's really not so much a change in strategy. It's a change in the market and the way people want to buy and the way products behave which makes it very, very important to have tight alignment and seamlessness in your products. And then the last just factual comment I'll make to Jan's point, is we -- because we have capital, if something accelerated our progress, we would do it no different than we're doing some of these internal organic things that we're investing in to accelerate our progress. So if there's an external opportunity to use our capital, we would. But the fact is that over the last couple years, when you look at the balance of capital deployment, Jan and I have this discussion all the time, we haven't consciously avoided doing acquisitions. It's just been harder to find ones that make sense and fit in what we're doing in terms of our strategy. But net-net when you get down to it, we're spending, call it $300 million to $400 million less on acquisitions and we're spending more on things like internally developed products, capital expenditures and the investments that we 're talking about for FY '17. So it wasn't necessarily planned that way, but it just so happens that, you know, we 're not necessarily deploying any more capital, but we 're just deploying it in a slightly different way. But we do retain the right to deploy capital towards acquisitions as well. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon Just wondering if you could just add a little more color in terms of the service realignment, in terms of, you know, how clients may end up being serviced? Is it -- you know, is there going to be a transition to like a dedicated service rap for the mid-market? What did you see out of the pilot studies and what's the -- what's the reaction internally, you know, with some of the service providers in terms of potentially geographically relocating? Carlos Rodriguez It's a great question. We'll give you a little bit of color and then maybe Jan can add in terms of what he's hearing out in the field. It's interesting the term dedicated reps, because we do have parts of our business, obviously in the up-market and national accounts, we have very specific people that service specific clients. And then when you get in the small business market, we tend to have a model where, you know, the execution and the delivery is very important, but the person that you reach is not as important. We believe that's the right model. We believe our retention rates and our growth in the small business market prove that our model works as long as you execute well and we would also argue that in today's world, having a dedicated rep who works eight hours a day might not be the best service model for a small company or any other company. So we prefer to focus on how -- what's the best way to deliver the best service to the client in the way they want it delivered. And it varies from small business up to the up-market in terms of whether you need a dedicated person or not, but I would encourage you to kind of visualize this service realignment as being more around teams rather than dedicated people, so having alignment around teams. So as an example, given the attach rates that we've discussed over multiple quarters that we're experiencing now in the mid-market and in the up-market, around additional HCM modules -- in other words, clients are rarely buying just payroll by itself or just benefits administration by itself. So this service model really is intended to be able to provide a group of people or a team of people who work together, who are collocated and can deliver service across the entire HCM spectrum. That obviously requires some cross-training, but also some ability for people who have special skills to be available and close to people who need to support our clients on a multiple number of issues. So we have a reasonable amount of experience in experimenting with what we call intact teams or with collocated teams and we feel good about the results when it comes to retention, when to comes to client satisfaction and by the way in our business, when you have those two things, margin follows. So this is primarily led by quality and experience for the client and also by the way, opportunity for our associates. So what we have found also is in some of our subscale locations, there's very, very limited mobility and opportunity for associates to progress from a career standpoint.  And we now have a number of opportunities across our business for people to learn new things and to move into different areas, whether it's time and attendance and pay roll, benefits administration, talent management, we really run the whole gamut on HCM and we needs across the entire business and when we have people scattered across the entire country in small subscale locations, it just doesn't I think make sense from a talent management standpoint for ourselves, internally either. And so on all those fronts, we think that this service alignment strategy makes sense. Jan Siegmund Carlos mentioned most of the factors. I would add, too, we have seen a rise in our associate engagement scores as a consequence for those who work in those intact teams. And it reflects probably better of how in a modern team environment our associates want to work. So that's really exciting for our associates as well. And one additional component that a strategic move on locations allows you to plan for is also a coordinated effort between our market segments, small, medium and large. So I think we mentioned it in the call. So now we have collocation between those market segments and there can be natural growth and exchange of best practices between the different platforms. And for some of the platforms, the back end is fairly similar. If you think about sender-self excellence for our tax filing operation and so forth, so it allows us also to create buckets of scale that are very hard to create in smaller locations. So it really, I believe, will transform of how associates be perceiving A, the value of the job they're in and the job opportunities then that can reach in the future and allows us to deliver additional service capabilities to our clients which is the strategic benefit that we're reaping out of it. Mark Marcon Certainly seems to make a lot of sense. I applaud you for taking this long-term step. Can you talk also with regards to the expectation for new bookings growth, where you would expect to see the strongest growth in terms of which areas? Jan Siegmund Yes, I'll take this right on -- if you look at FY '16, we had actually fairly balanced growth across the business. We had great performance really along all segments and continued strength in multinational, great performance really across all segments. Maybe the only spot that has been a little bit harder was Europe as you might imagine and our best of breed solutions, but that was really more than balanced by good demand from multinational solutions. So when we look at the plan, other than specific grow-over challenges that we had because ACA cells were concentrated in the mid-market and in the up-market. If you take that out it's really each of the business units continues with very good performance and just as a reminder, it was $1.75 billion of recurring revenue that sales force generated for ADP and even if the growth is a few percentage points slower, this kind of still a very significant number. Operator Our last question for today will be coming from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC. Your line is open. Gary Bisbee I wanted to go back to an earlier question, just around the concept of revenue acceleration. So you've had two years of above-trend bookings, you've got pace for control continuing to click along at a similar pace, you had a drag this year from selling a business that will no longer be a drag in 2017 and you know, retention was a drag, I guess you're not saying specifically, but maybe still a drag, but it sounds like a lesser one potentially in 2017. So why don't -- you've always said the current-year bookings don't do a lot to revenue. Why wouldn't we see some acceleration? Is it as simple as PEO? You're calling for that to be slower? It just feels like there should be a bit better revenue growth from, you know, thinking through all these moving parts. Thank you. Jan Siegmund Yes, the math is how the math is going to work out between the starts that we have sold and the retention and there's really no change in how we have built our business models over time. We did have a little bit of unusual revenue skewing that created the more revenue acceleration, I guess, in this year than for next year which contributes a little bit to the thing. But if you -- if you take that into account, there's really nothing that unusual in next year's revenue growth. Carlos Rodriguez Yes and I think that all the things you mentioned it's important to acknowledge what you said. We do, again even though we don't give specific guidance, we do expect less of a drag for example from retentions, because we expect things to get better. We have some metrics and some things underlying, I think, data that give us hope at least, right? Because we don't know for sure that will improve your math, the comments you made about new the business bookings, all those things are correct. I think I would just encourage you to maybe spend some time offline with us in terms of kind of the math and how the revenue works. One of the interesting things about this business, this is an incredibly stable and predictable business model. It's also very, very hard to move the numbers dramatically one way or the other over the course of one year. So over the course of four or five years, we've had double digit new business bookings and this year we had a blip with retention. But retention's also been fairly stable. That's allowed us to accelerate our revenue growth about 1/2 to 1 percentage point from, call it five years ago, in employer services. The PEO, as you said, also happens to be a factor because it's growing faster and it's becoming a larger portion of the overall results. So if it slows slightly that has an impact, too. So we'll spend the time to make sure we do the math, but what I can tell you is that you're right, that this year, if you exclude the impact of the divestiture or if you don't factor the divestiture in, we were close to 9% revenue growth. We're really proud of that. And next year we're slightly below that because there's one day less, because this year was a leap year or whatever the issues are and we have a drag still from, even though retention's getting better, it's still not as good as it used to be. We're still going to be pretty damn happy and pretty damn proud, because we're going to be in I think still, in the high end of our guidance from a revenue standpoint. And in this business, when you get into that range, given who we're, in terms of because we understand, we have very keen insight into who we're, like as a company in terms of where we want to be, in terms of our growth rates and our margin improvement and the balance of those things, I think we're, I think satisfied with that outcome. It obviously makes it easier as you pick up additional revenue growth because of the nice leverageability of our operating model. But, you know, that's part of why we're also doing some of the things we 're doing around service alignment, because we know that we're really not, I think satisfied with just the results that we have today. On the other hand, we're not going to sit here and tell you that we're trying to aim for 10%, 12%, 15% revenue growth because that's really not who we're. So 7% to 9% is our long-term guidance for revenue growth, with some margin improvement, with a healthy dividend, with share buybacks, that's our model, that's what we're executing against. And I'm proud of the Organization and the results they delivered this year. And I think if we deliver the results that we've put out there for next year, we're going to be just as proud of that as well. Gary Bisbee Okay, great. And then if I could add just one quick follow up. On the ACA product, how much of the revenue would be charged for sending out like the 1095 forms and what not versus -- I assume there's some ongoing revenue related to the analytics and compliance tool-- Jan Siegmund Yes, this allows me to make another pitch for our fantastic and very differentiated ACA product. It is actually far more than just sending out 1095 and 1094 forms. It is really a compliance service that we offer, that ongoing offers -- ongoing monitoring and assessment services for eligibility and affordability. And also which is really very differentiated in this market, offers what we call notice management services at the back-end to react to agency and exchange notices and keep the company in compliance with those, that's where a bulk of the fines can actually incur. So we build our clients on a per-employee per month basis. So the revenue stream is actually not concentrated on a specific form delivery, it's an annualized recurring revenue. And so you should think about the revenues exactly the same way you think about the rest of ADP. Operator Thank you. This concludes our question and answer session for today. I'm pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos Rodriguez Thanks. This is our 67th year and where we've combined world class operations with innovative products and services that meet the dynamic needs of our clients. This was never more evident than in 2016 and I'm proud of the success of our business in getting the solutions to market to meet those needs of the clients and if I can get on my soap box for a second, I mentioned previously that ADP -- this is ADP's 41st consecutive year of paying and increasing our dividend. And as a dividend aristocrat, ADP is one of just over 50 companies in the S&P 500 who have paid an increase of dividend for more than 25 years. Now with some of the things we're talking about for FY '17, ADP leaders and associates are making the investments to lay the foundation for ADP to join the dividend royals in nine years. And that's a list of just 17 companies who have paid and increased their dividend for more than 50 years. Any student of business knows that only the most durable and enduring icons of business make either list. This success is entirely attributable to the hard work and dedication of our associates, who commit themselves every day to ensuring our clients' success. So to them and to all before them, I say thank you. And I thank you all for joining the call today and for your interest in ADP. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes today's conference.

We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Carl. Carl Bass Thanks, Dave. We had a terrific quarter, and we reached a very important milestone with the end of selling perpetual licenses. Our Q2 results mark another solid quarter of execution and progress on our two big initiatives; increasing lifetime customer value; and secondly, driving increased adoption of our cloud-based solutions. I'll share more details on our Q2 results and then update you on what we've been doing around creating long-term shareholder value before getting into the current quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Starting with subscription numbers, we added 109,000 net new subscriptions in the quarter. We're really happy with the growth of new model subscription additions, which more than doubled year-over-year to 125,000. It was a strong quarter for product subscriptions, which drove the vast majority of the new model sub additions and its a clear sign of the progress on the transition with our customers and partners. Keep in mind that we didn't have any big promotions going on like we did in Q1. Product subscriptions had strong sequential growth and dramatic year-over-year growth of over three times. Product subscriptions come to us from a number of sources. We're really pleased to see that one of the primary sources continues to be net new customers, which accounted for approximately one-third of product subscription additions in Q2. It's impossible to get perfect clarity on these new customers, but it's likely that a portion of these people were previously pirating software and now have a much more affordable option with our subscription. Still others have been using alternative design tool and can now get access to better software. Looking at the other new model subscription types, our token-based EBAs experienced good year-over-year growth, but added fewer than we did in our seasonally high Q1. And once again, we had a record quarter for cloud subscription additions. BIM 360 and Fusion 360 are leading the way, and we continue to have success with our other cloud products such as Shotgun and Fusion Lifecycle, formerly known as PLM 360. We continue to build on our leadership in the cloud and our cloud services play an increasingly important role in our transition. Maintenance is our other primary subscription bucket. The renewal rate for maintenance subscriptions increased significantly year-over-year and remain near historic highs. Keep in mind that as we go forward, we'll start to experience larger decreases in maintenance subscriptions since we are no longer selling perpetual licenses. We'll also be incentivizing customers on maintenance to switch to a product subscription. As we've outlined in the past, by the end of next fiscal year, we expect to have more customers on our new model subscriptions than maintenance subscriptions. We are adamant about supporting our maintenance customers, and at some point in the future, these programs will converge into a single subscription offering. As we've indicated before, growth in subscriptions will drive growth in ARR. The strong growth in new model subscriptions in Q2 fueled an 86% year-on-year constant currency increase in new model ARR. Total ARR growth was 14% in constant currency year-over-year. Total recurring revenue was 67% of our total reported revenues. That's a big jump compared to 55% in Q2 last year and a slight decrease from last quarter due to the surge in perpetual suite sales. With just a few exceptions, we're now in a subscription-only model, so you can expect another jump in the percentage of recurring revenue starting in Q3. Our Q2 revenue results were well ahead of expectations and were influenced primarily by a larger-than-expected surge in last opportunity buying of perpetual licenses for suites. Recall that in Q4, we had 10% increase in unit volume related to the end of sale of perpetual licenses for individual products. Our analysis of Q2 suggests that just under 20% of our unit volume was related to end-of-sale activity for suites. This was bigger than expected, and I'd like to give you some insights on what we saw. It was only over the last two weeks of the quarter that we started to experience a surge in demand for suites perpetual licenses, almost entirely driven by the channel. What was really interesting is that at the same time we experienced the uptick in perpetual license sales, we also saw the acceleration of product subscription sales. The unique aspect of this activity relative to what we experienced in Q4 is that roughly half of the volume for suites came from customers crossgrading from an individual product. This is neutral to the subscription count since the customer has to be on maintenance in order to crossgrade, but it's absolutely positive for in-period revenue and ultimately ARR, since the customer will be paying more annually for their maintenance plan. Overall, the increase in volume related to the end of perpetual suites was greater than we anticipated, but we are very pleased with how product subscriptions performed in the quarter and the overall net result is positive for Autodesk. Our total unit volume in the second quarter increased compared to Q2 last year and was in line with our expectations even when normalizing for the increased activity related to the end of sale for suites. It's not surprising that the end of sale for suites drove a sequential uptick in license revenue. What might be surprising is that we're not seeing faster growth in our as-reported subscription revenue line. There are two things that are inhibiting that growth. The first is FX, which is causing about a 4 point headwind. The second is the accounting treatment of product subscription and EBA revenue. While our new model subscriptions are deferred and recognized ratably over their contract length, a sizable portion of both our product subscription and our EBAs are recognized as license revenue. In fact, roughly 80% of product subscription and roughly 55% of EBAs get recorded as license revenue. Cloud is the only new model subscription type that gets 100% recorded as subscription revenue. If all the new model subscriptions were recognized 100% as subscription revenue, that line would show 10% year-over-year growth as reported and 14% growth adjusted for currency. We are currently working towards providing a clearer breakout of our reporting so that our total subscription revenue can be seen directly in our reporting disclosures. Now let me get into a few more details of our Q2 results. By now it should be very clear that our channel partners are fully engaged with our subscription model. 68% of new model subscription additions came through our channel partners compared to just 47% in Q2 last year and 63% last quarter. The volume of subscriptions coming through our eStore also continues to gain momentum and nearly doubled from Q2 last year. Total direct revenue was 25% in the second quarter despite most of the surge from the end of sale of suites coming through the channel. That's up from 20% in Q2 last year. On the expense side, our total spend decreased by almost 4% as we continue to diligently control our spending. We are continuing to make structural changes that allow us to spend less yet focus on our key initiatives. While we are being very disciplined about our spending, we are doing it without compromising the long-term health of the company.  We also increased our stock buyback in Q2 to $170 million in light of the dip in the stock caused by the temporary panic around the Brexit vote. Overall, we were very pleased with the Q2 results. All of the trends we saw reinforced our confidence that the transition is working for our customers, our partners and Autodesk. That's a good segue into what I've touched on in the last couple of earnings calls about what we're doing to create long-term value for our shareholders. We continue to get many questions in this area, so I'm happy to talk about it. If you've been around the tech industry as long as I have, you've no doubt seen the carnage of once great technology companies that ultimately failed to innovate and keep their competitive advantage. Autodesk has been the leader in the world of design and engineering software for over 30 years and what we're doing with this transition is positioning Autodesk to lead the next generation of this kind of software. Our transition happens on two fronts. We're currently in the midst of a business model and pricing transition, where our customers are moving to term-based subscriptions. This will lead to a highly predictable model over time and a significant increase in the value our customers get from our products. The best indicator for this is the rapid growth we're experiencing in new model subscriptions and new model ARR. In support of this model change, we are simplifying our entire go-to-market strategy and reducing our cost structure while we increase our ability to more effectively serve our customers. The second front of our transition is how we are building platforms to exploit the cloud and dramatically expand the size of our market opportunities. We're well ahead of our traditional competitors on this front, and we're investing to secure the future of Autodesk. These mobile and cloud technologies are opening up significant opportunities in the areas of construction and manufacturing that are completely new to Autodesk. These new platforms are for a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine the competitive landscape. Our cloud-based products continue to gain momentum and are already the undisputed leaders in their respective categories. So this is how I'd summarize how we're building long-term shareholder value in three simple bullets; one, we're increasing the lifetime value of every customer; two, we're changing our cost structure by focusing our product portfolio and go-to-market strategies; and three, we're building the best cloud and mobile-based products and services in the industry, which significantly expands our total available market as the underlying technology platform shifts to the cloud. Now let's take a look at what's going on here in the current quarter, Q3. Our newly introduced Collections are a great example of increasing lifetime customer value. On August 1, we launched Collections, which is our next generation of suites with the addition of our cloud services. Suites was tremendously successful for Autodesk, but with Collections, we're significantly reducing complexity by offering just 3 Collections, one for AEC, one for Manufacturing and one for M&E, making them easier to sell and consume. We're offering single-user and multi-user access and choices of different term lengths to fit their needs. The value of our customers is tremendous and well exceeds the premium suite. We've priced Collections so that the average customer value to Autodesk will increase as well. We're only 25 days into selling Collections, but we're very happy with the start. Despite the strong performance of suites at the end of Q2, in their first few weeks we're seeing the same volume level for Collections that we experienced for suites in the same period a year ago. From a tactical standpoint, some of you have been asking about pricing and promotions. We are currently running another promotion aimed at our legacy customers. It's similar to the very successful promotion that we ran in Q1, but the discount is smaller. You can expect us to continue to work to convert these legacy customers with various promotions and incentives as we go forward. Like I've said before, running a business is different than running a spreadsheet. One area that we constantly evaluate is how we use pricing to drive subscriptions and ARR growth. Having said that, we wouldn't make significant decisions around packaging or pricing without first testing in certain markets. This is especially true when it comes to our flagship products like AutoCAD and LT. In early September, pricing changes will go into effect that will rationalize the pricing of AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and the AutoCAD verticals. We believe these moves will drive customers to the right product for their needs at higher billings and ARR for Autodesk. Now turning to our outlook for Q3 and the full year. Our view of the macroeconomic environment's impact on our business hasn't changed over the past several quarters. The global conditions have remained uneven with most of the mature markets performing relatively well, while most of the emerging markets have been challenged. As we evaluated our strong Q2 results, we didn't see any meaningful change in the demand environment. And as I indicated earlier, we don't see any immediate fallout from the Brexit vote. As always, it's impossible to say what the long-term impact might be, but we don't see any near-term risk. Our strong Q2 results likely pulled forward some demand from the second half of the year, but we're comfortable with bringing up the bottom end of our previous ranges for both revenue and EPS for FY '17. We're also lowering our spend projection for FY '17 based on the better-than-expected progress we've made on this front. We remain confident in our long-term goals of growing our subscription base by a 20% CAGR through FY '20, which will drive a 24% CAGR in ARR. We also remain committed to keeping spend growth flat in FY '18. The lower spend projection also enhances our projected path to free cash flow of roughly $6 per share in FY '20 and $11 per share in FY '23. So to wrap things up, we're very pleased with the consistent execution over the past few quarters. We're really excited to be another major step further along in the transition and now fully in the subscription-only model. We have a clear vision and plan for creating a more predictable, recurring and profitable business in the years to come. We are focused on driving higher lifetime value, simplifying our offerings and our go-to-market activities, and significantly increasing our market opportunity as we lead the next wave of design and engineering software to the cloud. Operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer Carl, let me ask you first about the pricing that you plan to take next month. Could you give some specifics as to how you're thinking about what the changes might be? And is this part of what you referred to in the past as SRP realization as a concept for you to help improve pricing and margin? Secondly, with respect to the decay of classic maintenance over time, how are you thinking about the rate of that decline? When we look at one of your competitors BBC, which is moving mostly but not entirely to subscription, the state of rate of decline for their maintenance is low to mid-single digit. So would you anticipate going fully to subscription that your decay of maintenance might be so much faster than that? Carl Bass Yes. So let me start with the pricing and then Scott and I can kind of tag team the one about the maintenance decline. So starting with the pricing, what we wanted to do was, as I said, kind of rationalize the 3 different price points of AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and the AutoCAD verticals. Whenever possible, we would like customers to get the right product. More often than not, that is on AutoCAD vertical, particularly tailored to what they -- the discipline they're in. And on the other side, for the more casual users, LT is clearly the more appropriate product. And what we were trying to do is move the price points apart, get the appropriate separation. And what we saw, I kind of referred to in the remarks, in our testing is that we can, with the right pricing, move more LT customers to AutoCAD and AutoCAD customers to the vertical. And so this is a part of the overall pricing. I wouldn't say it's particularly what I would refer to the SRP realization. It's just increasing total pricing, but it's part of a pricing optimization strategy. And let me take the first pass. Couple of things will contribute to the maintenance decline, as you said, classic maintenance. One is going to be the fall off from people who just choose not to renew for all of the usual reasons. The second one will be the conversion of the maintenance customers on to the subscription side. And on the first one, we talked a little bit about it and that we said that we expected the subscription base to be larger by the end of next year, and we gave you some hints or at least we gave you an algebra problem you can work on tonight, Jay. And then on the second one, we also talked a little bit about programmatic ways of doing that and over time how we will continue to encourage customers to move from classic maintenance to the new subscriptions. Scott, you want to add something? Scott Herren No, I think you said it right. It's the decay rate. We [indiscernible] vary within that pool of maintenance subscribers by the way between low-end LT customers that have a slightly lower renewal rate versus suites maintenance customers, which have a much higher renewal rate. So as that pool moves over, the maintenance pool will go continually down from this point, basically 1 minus our turn rate. And at that point, what you'll see is the mix will shift inside that pool. So if you think of maintenance revenue as a P-time SKU, think of the price, the average price inside there beginning to shift more toward suites customers out through time, but the overall decline being driven by the low-end LT customers. I think the other way to peg this, Jay, as you sit down and do your modeling, is what we've said -- and I think we showed you these curves back at Investor Day, that our expectation is by the end of next year, the number of maintenance subscribers and the maintenance ARR will be below the new model subscribers and new model ARR by the end of next year. Operator [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Saket Kalia Maybe first to start off, I know ARR, maybe this is for you, Scott, but I know ARR is the better metric to look at. But for those of us that still look at billings, can you just give us a sense for how billings or maybe trending for those new model subscribers or new model billings versus maintenance billings because you obviously have a headwind from maintenance in that deferred revenue accounts? So any color on how new model billings are doing would be helpful? Scott Herren Yes, Saket. One of the reasons that I don't think billings are the best indicator of our progress of course is they are term specific. And if I sign a new customer, but they only sign up for 1 year, that's 1/3 of the billings if I sign that same customer for 3 years. So I think it's a little bit less of an indicator than things like ARR, which are annualized than, of course, the overall subscription growth. But if you do quick math, deferred revenue changed by $3 million during the quarter, so our billings tracked pretty much to our reported revenues. And when you peel back billings at a high level, they track very much in line with what you see on subscription versus license. Saket Kalia Got it. That's helpful. And then for my follow-up, Carl, I think you mentioned that you saw good crossgrade activity for maintenance to product subscriptions, which of course is a net neutral to the subs count. Can you just give us a sense for how many of those crossgrade you saw this quarter? And then more broadly, are you still seeing customers from product versions older than five years make that crossgrade? Carl Bass Yes, so let me go backwards. Well, so we didn't see customers from very far back because we didn't run any of the promotions. So the typical kind of legacy promotion where people had to be on subscription already. What I did mention is that in Q3, we were running a similar promotion to the one that we ran in Q1. So again, we'll talk about that 90 days from now and see how many of the legacy customers we can attract. We didn't break out the number on your other question of people who converted, but it was a substantial number. I'll leave it to Scott if he wants to give a number. Scott Herren Yes, the color I'd add to that is, if you think of the quarter that we just closed, we actually saw 2 end of sale surges kind of at the same time. There was -- the normal end of sale surge that -- like we saw in Q4, where it was the last chance for our customer who wanted to buy a Suite perpetual license and there are some buy ahead activity, some pull ahead of future demand for that set of customers. And by the way, we predicted that, I think, pretty accurately versus what the results were. The piece that also happened was, of course, when we saw your last perpetual license, you also saw your last crossgrade. And we saw a lot of the same behavior that we saw at the end of -- if you remember when we stop selling upgrades in our fiscal '15, so more than a year ago, we saw a big spike in demand for people who were already using our product, but decided they wanted to upgrade to a more full functioned product. They're willing to pay more for it. We saw some of that same upgrade-like behavior happen within our crossgrades. And I think that's the piece that surprised us a bit and it's a positive for ARR. It's a neutral for subscribers because you had to be on maintenance to be eligible for the crossgrade, but it's a positive for ARR and it's a positive for total revenue going forward. So that's the way I would think about the surge we saw at the end of this quarter. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Richard Davis from Canaccord. Richard Davis So it sounds like -- I mean, you're getting good growth as you kind of pointing out, reduced piracy and also kind of changed vendors. The question that I hear, when you hear from people thinking about changing vendors is a big hurdle is just kind of the data migration and things like that. Has there been any -- have you guys done anything technologically to make that less painful? Because if I have a model set and a different vendor, I'm terrified that if I move it over to you guys, it will incinerate me or something like that. So that's really kind of -- help me understand how you can make that less fearful for these folks trying to... Carl Bass Yes. Despite the advice of our legal counsel, I can guarantee you it will incinerate you, Richard. Let me just divide the markets and talk about the dynamics slightly differently. In the AEC market, which is more project based, it comes up for a building or a roadway or a bridge. There is more willingness -- there is slightly more willingness to shift with new projects as new teams come together. I think the place where you hear even greater reluctance is in manufacturing. And there we did -- we've done a number of things that we've rolled out across our product portfolio that allow customers to work in new software and access the data that they created over the last couple of decades. So they can work with the native data. They don't -- obviously, as always, we can translate it and convert it. But even more importantly, we now let customers leave their data in the native data format and work on it whether they're doing modeling or visualization or simulation. So that's been, over the last two years, a pretty big breakthrough in giving people a much smoother ramp to go from one of the legacy products to a new one. And at a certain point, one of the other things that has to happen in motivating people to move to something is the new stuff has to be that much better. If you think about it, particularly manufacturing, many of the products that people are using are more than 20 years old. And we would like to think in the industry that we can do better than having 20-year-old products be state of the art. So part of it is making the new products and the new product experiences much more compelling. The other is to reassure people about being able to migrate their data or to use all their data and access it for as long as they need to. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Shateel Alam This is Shateel Alam in for Heather. First one is on expenses. So your expenses were down 4% this quarter and you lowered guidance for the year. Can you talk about some of the actions you've taken that are driving this spend to be lower than you're expecting? In the past, you talked about discontinuing some noncore products in trade of hardware. Just wondering if we could see more of that. Are you done with that type of product streamlining? Carl Bass The two biggest places have clearly been on consolidation of the product portfolio, and the second place is in, I just say, overall in our go-to-market activities. As it refers to the product portfolio, I mean, we're on a multi-year transition to a much more streamlined portfolio, including making the end of life of certain products. But also, as you look at collections as a big simplification from suites, all across the board, we're trying to simplify the portfolio, make it easy on customers, make it easy on our partners. And so you'll continue to see the folding in of certain functionality into the products that we keep going forward, the elimination of some of the older and less important ones. And we're constantly pruning for the things that work and don't work. So I would not, at all, expect to see -- or said more positively, I would expect to see that same kind of proactive management of the portfolio for the next couple of years. Shateel Alam Got it, that's helpful. And then for my follow-up, new model subs, the additions of 125 was higher than we're expecting. Can you just give some color on the mix that was traditional, desktop and EBA versus new cloud offerings? And are we starting to see new cloud subs become a higher portion of the adds now? Scott Herren Yes, Shateel. This is Scott. We had a record, I think, Carl mentioned this actually in the opening commentary. We had a record quarter for cloud sub adds, so it continues to move along nicely. But that new model space will continue -- did this quarter and will continue into the future to be dominated by product subscriptions, so term licenses. In fact, for the first time, we had more inventory of product subscriptions within the new model type than of enterprise coming out of the EBAs. So think of it as being dominated by product subscriptions, EBAs would be next, cloud would be next. Shateel Alam Great. Thank you. Thats helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen and Company. Gregg Moskowitz Okay. Thank you very much and good afternoon. Carl, if you look at Asia Pac, customers there have historically moved more slowly to adapt to our subscriptions. In the Q1, however, you did reference, I think, an uptick in new model subscriptions towards the end of that period. Can you give us an update on what you saw out of Asia in Q2? Carl Bass Yes. I mean, I will continue to say that parts of Asia are slower to adopt the new model. We've had some pockets of success with some of our traditional partners in some of the electronic channels that have been more positive, but overall, slightly slower adoption with a handful of countries. And as you do the analysis, it's a little bit hard to dissect exactly what's going on since up until now, the preference of the channel partners kind of shown through and that they were able to exert certain forces on the customers. Moving forward, that goes away so, hopefully, everyone will be aligned. It's a great relief to make it to August 1 and get into just the new model. And I suspect going forward, we'll see more normalization. But given that there were two choices, Asia Pac certainly lagged a little bit. Gregg Moskowitz Okay, that's helpful. And then just for Scott, based on where you are at this point in the year, you're calling for about 250,000 or so net subscribers in the second half, at least, at the midpoint of the range. And I know you don't guide quarterly, of course, but maybe you can just share with the group your high-level thoughts around net adds for Q3 as compared with Q4 as you see it today. Thanks. Scott Herren Yes, sure, Gregg. We always have a seasonal pattern of demand. If you think of where the subs will come into the second half of the year, there will be more than 100% of what we add will be new model, right. Maintenance will be on a continual slow, but on a steady decline. So all of the new adds will come from new model types. New model types tend to have the same seasonality as a lot of our, previously, our perpetual license did. So heavier in Q4 than in Q3 would be normal demand pattern. We also see Q4 typically heavy on EBA sales, although as you see in the last couple of years, we sell a lot of them in Q4, the EBAs will pick up those subs in Q1. So think of this as being driven -- the Q3 versus Q4 driven by our normal seasonality pattern first. And then secondarily, we do think was were some demand pulled forward from some of the end of sale of suites at the very end of Q2 that probably makes Q3 from a sub adds standpoint a little bit more challenging than what we'd normally expect with normal seasonality. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Citigroup. Ken Wong Great. Thanks for taking my question. My first question for you, Carl, with collections now, it's been out in the market for about a month. How should we think about kind of the customers you're attracting here? Is it customers that are using a few products moving up to collections? Or are you seeing your traditional suite customers kind of recognize the incremental value with this comprehensive bundle, and those are ones that are primarily moving towards collections? Carl Bass Yes, Ken, it's probably just a little too early to know for sure. And it's almost like give us the two more months. In this first month, we have certainly seen some of the suites customers move over. Some of the buying at the end of the quarter was anticipation of being able to move from suites to collections. So there's certainly some of that in there, but we'll be able to do a little bit better breakdown of the customers when we get a little bit more traction there. It's just a little bit premature. Ken Wong Got it. And then earlier in your prepared remarks, you mentioned at some point convert to a single subscription offering. Is this just consistent with what you guys have said in the past where just kind of a natural bleed off of maintenance and then you eventually just be all kind of new model subs? Or is there something more specific that you guys are looking to do to try to converge that process sooner? Carl Bass Two things. I think we're being more direct in a general sense, but it's probably, at this point, we don't want to give more details. But what we do know and we have talked about the complexity and the expense that comes with multiple models. And so we'll continue to look at ways to just simplify all of the offerings and merge the programs into one as it makes sense. But I think we were, at least, hinting at more proactive behavior on our part. Scott Herren Yes, Ken, the only color I would add to that is you've seen us do some of this already, first, with suites and now with collections. You see us bundling together to kind of ease the ramp from -- you see us bundling the Windows-based, whether it's perpetual license or product subscriptions, with cloud to kind of ease that on-ramp. And I think you'll see us continue to do more of that to make it easier to consume, to give customers a choice within what they ought to execute, whichever product type that they like. That was one of the guiding tenants with the way we design collections, and I think you'll just see that continue. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Steve Ashley Hi. Most of my questions have been asked, but let me ask about Japan. Just maybe color on what is going on there. And is there, trend-wise, any hope or any color on that would be great. Carl Bass I'd say flat line. It is what it is. It hasn't gotten better and it hasn't gotten worse. Scott, would you want to... Scott Herren I think, that's right. I think, the year-on-year impacts in Japan are probably more pronounced than elsewhere because they were slower last year to adopt a new model type, so the falling off a cliff of going from perpetual license to new model types is more pronounced in Japan than it is elsewhere. I think that's part of what we're seeing. Part of it is just the continuation of the trend that we've seen where it's been a tough economy in Japan, and we feel some of that. And I think it's -- so no change is what I'd say, Steve. But I think part of what we're feeling from a year-on-year standpoint is just the difference in the adoption model. Steve Ashley And then in terms of the promotions you're running, you've been great about calling out the fact that you are running a fairly aggressive promotion less discounting than we saw in the first quarter. But in terms of digital marketing and how much wood you're putting behind the arrow, is there any difference in how visible you will be with this promotion versus the one you ran in the first quarter? Carl Bass Yes, Steve. What I said, last time, we thought the promotion was generous, but not well known by all of our customers. And after having run it in that one quarter, we thought we could turn the two knobs and turn down the discounting and turn up the awareness. And as we said a quarter ago, we were extremely pleased and surprised by the results at how far back into a legacy user base we could reach. And that was with, I'd say, minimal awareness. And so we would like to promote that more heavily going forward, and we thought we could accomplish both goals of greater SRP realization and a good response by just turning up the awareness. So you should see a little bit more of it. And as we indicated in the opening commentary, you can see more of it going forward. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. Given the fact that suites were a bigger part of sort of what was going on in this quarter, you talked a lot about a lot more new model subscription types coming from suites. I would have expected the ARPS number, the pricing side of the equation start to improve. But by my math, it's still down sequentially a little bit both on maintenance and new model subs. One -- as a two-part question, one, why has that continued to decline? And two, when should we expect that to turn back up and start being one of the drivers of ARR growth? Scott Herren Yes, Keith. We talked about this I think last quarter as well. Part of what's going on there is just the math. When you do the ARPS calculation, you're taking a quarter average ARR and dividing it by a quarter end sub count, right? So if you go back and say quarter average ARR divided by quarter average sub count, you'll get a different answer on that. But I think overriding longer term, you do need to expect for some period of time that to continue to come down. And it will come down simply driven by mix. We've talked about ARPS being very mix sensitive. It will continue to be mix sensitive. And as we get further out and layer on more quarters of selling suites and collections in our higher-priced products only in the new model way, you'll begin to see that ARPS rebound. But short term, we'll continue -- that pool will be more heavily dominated by the lower-priced LT and AutoCAD, things that have been out there only as product subs for the last six months. That's the way you ought to think about it. Very mix sensitive. Carl Bass And to be a little bit more quantitative about it, I would look out about three quarters before we probably saw the inflection. Keith Weiss Okay. And that's just because -- that's what I was going to how long it will take for the demand on the suite side of the equation or now the collection side of the equation to really ramp up and sort of normalize that mix? It felt like once you end perpetual for suites and all the new buying for those high-end products becomes new model, that should start sort of inflecting that number upwards? Scott Herren Yes, you've got to layer in multiple quarters of that ARR, Keith, before it gets -- it becomes as representative of the total new model ARR as the things that have already been out there for two or three quarters selling it only in a new model way. So that's the reason you see the lag. It starts now, but there'll be a lag effect before you get that entire pool properly representing what the new sales look like. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Brent Thill Thanks. Scott, the midpoint of the guide looks like there's a little sequential growth from Q3 to Q4. Can you just explain why that is? Scott Herren One of the benefits of the shift that we're taking is we have a lot more clarity on day one of a quarter of what the reported revenues are going to look like. So as we look at both what we already have in deferred revenue for Q3 and what's sitting in backlog, we've got very high coverage of the number that we forecast for Q3 and obviously, a higher degree of certainty on that. As we get closer to Q4, we'll be in that same position on Q4, and we can evaluate if it makes sense to go up at that point. Brent Thill Okay. And just a follow-up on the ARPS question. It was down 7%. I mean, should we continue to expect over the next couple of quarters that to be down mid-single digit? Is that kind of a good way to think of it? Or should we think on the higher end of this? Scott Herren Yes. Let me start, Carl, and you can add color. So think of ARPS at a minimum in the two line items, maintenance separate from new model. New model will have the trend that I just talked about, to Keith on the prior question, right? It will take a couple of quarters for that entire pool of new model ARR to be representative of the new sales that are going on. On the maintenance side, I think, you'll see the ARPS there rebound a little bit quicker. We will see -- we'll continue to see higher renewal rates on suites, and the suites will become a bigger part of the pool faster. So it may be a quarter out, it may be two quarters out, but I think you can expect to see ARPS rebound a little bit more quickly on the maintenance side than on the new model side. Carl Bass Yes, I would agree directionally with Scott, and I would say back to the mix, I think, as we gauge the success of legacy promotions and just the cloud services that will affect the mix as well. So we'll be able to give a little bit more clarity as we go there. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling Auty Thanks. Hi, guys. Given the perpetual sales of suites were higher than you expected in the quarter, is there a way to quantify the unit volume beyond the items you gave earlier? And specifically, what I'm looking for is, is there any chance that, that has an impact on your full year 475,000 to 525,000 subscription addition number because of that pull forward? Carl Bass Yes. So I mean, one is we raised the bottom of the range, which is our indication that we don't think it has any effect. We remain confident in that and I would say, increasingly confident about it. It was interesting to see, and as I tried to highlight in the remarks, as we saw the surge in the perpetual suites, what we also saw was the new model stuff also take off in the last couple of weeks. So we saw higher -- obviously, higher than anticipated volume. And I said when we give back out the extra buying of perpetual suites, it was the volume of activity that we would have expected for this quarter. It was -- it slightly exceeded our expectations. And then on top of that, we also had whatever pull forward. So I think you may see some shifting between quarters on the margin, but we're comfortable with the guidance for the rest of the year. And that's why we're willing to bring up the numbers. Scott Herren Yes, Sterling, I think that's kind of a little -- sorry, just on that last one, a little more context for you around the new model sub adds of 125,000 in the quarter. If you remember back in Q1, new model sub adds were 140,000, but buried in there were two things that didn't recur in Q2. One was the promo. We didn't run that legacy-focused promo in Q2. We will do that again, as Carl said, in Q3. The second is we had a big catchup of the EBAs that rolled in, in Q1 and were a little bit more than 25,000 of that 140,000 we had in Q1. If you net those two out, Q1, without those two, is in the, call it, 90,000 range. That grew to 125,000 new model sub adds in Q2. So I don't -- there's certainly the pull ahead, I don't think, signals any weakness in where we're headed of the new model side.  The only thing to bear in mind is a part of the pull ahead that we saw, a significant part, was driven by crossgrades. And to be eligible for a crossgrade, you had to already be a customer with a maintenance agreement attached. So all of those -- all of that pull ahead business was really neutral to subs. They already have a sub and they have a sub now. So it's not a big piece of that pull ahead. Really doesn't affect the subs growth. Sterling Auty That makes sense. And then the follow-up. Carl, the comment you said that the subscription has accelerated the same time as the perpetual. Were you suggesting that you had customers that were buying both perpetual and subscriptions? Or do you think it was more coincidental to see both accelerating at the same time? Carl Bass I don't  now, I'm speaking a little out of school. We got to do a little bit more work on this. But I don't think it was customers buying both. That's just a little bit of an awkward purchase. I think it was the outreach from our channel partners created demand. And when people decided to buy, then they made the choice. But more likely is they chose one or the other, not both at this point. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Matt Hedberg Sure. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Scott, I've got a modeling question. Now that you're done with the license option for software, how should we think of the trajectory of the run rate of that license line going forward? I think you do allocate some of the subscription sale to license. Is that correct? Scott Herren That is right, Matt. So if you look at that line, there's two components to it. One is perpetual license sales that get immediately recognized and of course, that piece goes to zero. The second is that line is actually a license and other, so there's some -- there's a grab bag of smaller items in there, some legacy products, little bit of consulting in there, so that piece, we've talked about that historically. If you go back a few quarters when we were selling perpetual licenses, that piece being about 10% of the total. That other piece will continue, the perpetual license piece goes to zero. The third piece is what you just said. Both the product subs and the EBAs, of course, when we sell it, it goes immediately into deferred revenue and gets recognized ratably.  But as it comes out of deferred, a portion of it -- because if you think of a term license, the customer is buying two things. They're buying access to the license and they're buying maintenance. So a portion of that deferred revenue accretes back into the license line and a portion of it accretes back into the maintenance line. I know it's confusing. I would love to say that I'm changing that today. We are working on changing that so that it's much clearer for you to be able to see how subscription revenue comes back into a line called subscription. Maintenance is in the maintenance line. And then what's left in license and other really is mostly other at that point. Carl Bass Yes. As I said, it's roughly 80% of the product subscription and 55% of the EBAs get recorded as license revenue. So it's way more than, I think, many people have in their models. And we're doing everything we can to change it and try to clarify it so that it's much clearer in terms of what, I think, everyone would just affectionately refer to as subscription. So we'll try to make this as clear possible, but hopefully, with -- there's two pieces of data. It's a little bit easy for others to model what's going on. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan Hey, guys. Sorry about that. Yeah. Thank you so much. Sorry about that. I wasn't sure if this question has been asked earlier, but I guess, more for Scott. What is your view on the new accounting standard that is being proposed by the FASB being reviewed by the SEC? I think they call it the ASC 606 that particularly applies to software companies that are trying to move into a more ratable model. How much of it does apply to Autodesk? How much of it does not apply to Autodesk? Just curious about your thoughts. Thank you.  Scott Herren Sure, Kash, it applies to everyone. It's not just Autodesk or non-Autodesk. It applies to everyone who's selling software. What we've been doing on that front, and I think we talked about this when you were in town a couple of months ago, we have been very actively engaged on this as we've done everything that we have to shift to a ratable revenue model, the last thing I want is to have that shift back based on the new rev rec guidelines. So our, I guess, he's now our controller has actually been a part of the AICPA task force that's working on clarifying the guidelines for FASB on how that will work. And if you think of a lot of our offerings, they're actually hybrid offerings. There's some term license in there, but there's a lot of cloud-based offering inside there. And so we are committed to continuing to maintain ratable revenue for our product sales for both the product subscription sales going forward -- obviously, cloud is pretty straightforward, and for EBAs. And we're staying very actively in touch with the group as those rules get clarified. Kash Rangan And one follow-up, if I could, for Carl, and I apologize if this question has already been answered. If yes, you don't need to. Any impact that you see from fiscal stimulus if the next presidential cycle brings that forth? Do you think there's any pent-up demand for infrastructure build-out globally and then particularly, in the United States that could help you guys? Thank you. Carl Bass Yes, I mean, anything that's, first, a larger infrastructure spend will be good. I would say just generally speaking, if you look across industries right now, AEC seems strong in all the countries we talked about where the economies are good. Construction in the US is really strong. Northern and Central Europe is really healthy. I mean, if there's political changes, there's more infrastructure spend, that would all be to the good side. We're not counting on it. We've heard that promise before, so -- but it would certainly be to our advantage. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg from Pacific Crest. Monika Garg Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First on the ARR. The ARR growth here was close to 10% but your long-term target is 24% CAGR, right? So this quarter, yes, of course, perpetual is impacting it, but for the next quarter, as you're not filling anymore perpetual licenses, should the ARR growth start trending towards 24% CAGR you've talked about? Scott Herren It will, Monika. That's not intended to be every single year and every single quarter will be 24%, obviously. I know you know that. It's a CAGR over that time frame. You will see ARR growth rates accelerate in the second half of the year, partly, because you see the divergence in the ARR growth rates between maintenance on a slight decline and new model growing 86% year-on-year at constant currency as new model becomes a bigger piece of the total, that drives it up. But also, as we go forward, there will be a higher and higher mix of new model subs. And within that, the subscriptions growth that will continue to drive new model to a significantly higher level. So you will see that begin to accelerate in the second half and continue. Monika Garg Thanks. So on the follow-up side, if you look at the revenue on the platform solution PSEB segment, that has come down Q-over-Q and year-over-year. Is there any reclassification in that segment? Scott Herren There is. It's a continuation of what we've seen over the last several quarters, actually, since we launched suites three years ago, three-plus years ago since we launched suites because what drives the vast majority of that PSEB segment is AutoCAD and LT. And of course, AutoCAD is included in almost all of our -- in fact, it might be in all of our suites that gets sold. And so whats happening is it's not that there's less AutoCAD going out into the world. What's happening instead is there's less of it being sold standalone and therefore, dropping into that PSEB segment and more of it being sold as a component in a suite and in the future, as a component in collections. Operator Thank you. And we have time for one more question today. Our final question comes from the line of Steve Koenig from Wedbush. Steve Koenig Thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. I apologize if this question has been asked. I just wanted to maybe understand probably a little bit your thinking behind collections and your design philosophy for it? And just my background for this question was, we were looking for an offering other than desktop subscription that might be a little bit more appropriate for the mid-market. Seeing some resistance in the mid-market to the subscriptions, more so than for AutoCAD and LTs being sold as DTS in the low end of the market. And yet collections, it looks very much like the desktop subscription. It's a larger bundle at a slightly higher price point. Maybe the question, besides your kind of your intent behind it is, what are the dividing line be in the market between your T-Flex and your EBAs versus Collections when it comes to consuming the suites in terms of kind of company side? Is that how we should think about it and what might that size be? Carl Bass Yes, so the first thing I would say is, so far, we gave a lot of proof points, hopefully, tonight. We haven't seen the resistance. And as a matter of fact, much of -- many of the new products and desktop subscriptions for both suites and collections is being sold through our channel partners, which serves the broadly speaking mid-market. So we think collections are a nice way to both simplify and get people the easy ramp to the new cloud services, so what they're familiar with plus the new stuff. Let me jump to the other side of it is our EBAs -- and as you mentioned, the technology behind it, the T-Flex, is really in the less than the top 1% of our accounts.  So it has a lot of room to grow before these two things run into each other. And what I would add is I would expect to see more flexibility in our product offerings going forward. Collections is really just a first step in the door of what we're going to do in terms of making sure the customers have more flexibility. And that's regardless of how it will be sold. At the same time, we've documented and we've talked about how we really want to see our EBAs go out to a broader audience and how that will grow over time. So we think there's a lot of room between the two right now, and there's actually an opportunity to introduce other offerings that have that level of flexibility from T-Flex. But for example, it can easily be sold by our channel partners. Operator Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Autodesk for any additional comments. David Gennarelli Thanks, operator. That concludes our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, you can reach me, Dave Gennarelli, at 415-507-6033. We'll also be at the Citi conference in New York on September 8. Thanks for joining us. Operator Thank you.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer Carl, let me ask you first about the pricing that you plan to take next month. Could you give some specifics as to how you're thinking about what the changes might be? And is this part of what you referred to in the past as SRP realization as a concept for you to help improve pricing and margin? Secondly, with respect to the decay of classic maintenance over time, how are you thinking about the rate of that decline? When we look at one of your competitors BBC, which is moving mostly but not entirely to subscription, the state of rate of decline for their maintenance is low to mid-single digit. So would you anticipate going fully to subscription that your decay of maintenance might be so much faster than that? Carl Bass Yes. So let me start with the pricing and then Scott and I can kind of tag team the one about the maintenance decline. So starting with the pricing, what we wanted to do was, as I said, kind of rationalize the 3 different price points of AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and the AutoCAD verticals. Whenever possible, we would like customers to get the right product. More often than not, that is on AutoCAD vertical, particularly tailored to what they -- the discipline they're in. And on the other side, for the more casual users, LT is clearly the more appropriate product. And what we were trying to do is move the price points apart, get the appropriate separation. And what we saw, I kind of referred to in the remarks, in our testing is that we can, with the right pricing, move more LT customers to AutoCAD and AutoCAD customers to the vertical. And so this is a part of the overall pricing. I wouldn't say it's particularly what I would refer to the SRP realization. It's just increasing total pricing, but it's part of a pricing optimization strategy. And let me take the first pass. Couple of things will contribute to the maintenance decline, as you said, classic maintenance. One is going to be the fall off from people who just choose not to renew for all of the usual reasons. The second one will be the conversion of the maintenance customers on to the subscription side. And on the first one, we talked a little bit about it and that we said that we expected the subscription base to be larger by the end of next year, and we gave you some hints or at least we gave you an algebra problem you can work on tonight, Jay. And then on the second one, we also talked a little bit about programmatic ways of doing that and over time how we will continue to encourage customers to move from classic maintenance to the new subscriptions. Scott, you want to add something? Scott Herren No, I think you said it right. It's the decay rate. We [indiscernible] vary within that pool of maintenance subscribers by the way between low-end LT customers that have a slightly lower renewal rate versus suites maintenance customers, which have a much higher renewal rate. So as that pool moves over, the maintenance pool will go continually down from this point, basically 1 minus our turn rate. And at that point, what you'll see is the mix will shift inside that pool. So if you think of maintenance revenue as a P-time SKU, think of the price, the average price inside there beginning to shift more toward suites customers out through time, but the overall decline being driven by the low-end LT customers. I think the other way to peg this, Jay, as you sit down and do your modeling, is what we've said -- and I think we showed you these curves back at Investor Day, that our expectation is by the end of next year, the number of maintenance subscribers and the maintenance ARR will be below the new model subscribers and new model ARR by the end of next year. Operator [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Saket Kalia Maybe first to start off, I know ARR, maybe this is for you, Scott, but I know ARR is the better metric to look at. But for those of us that still look at billings, can you just give us a sense for how billings or maybe trending for those new model subscribers or new model billings versus maintenance billings because you obviously have a headwind from maintenance in that deferred revenue accounts? So any color on how new model billings are doing would be helpful? Scott Herren Yes, Saket. One of the reasons that I don't think billings are the best indicator of our progress of course is they are term specific. And if I sign a new customer, but they only sign up for 1 year, that's 1/3 of the billings if I sign that same customer for 3 years. So I think it's a little bit less of an indicator than things like ARR, which are annualized than, of course, the overall subscription growth. But if you do quick math, deferred revenue changed by $3 million during the quarter, so our billings tracked pretty much to our reported revenues. And when you peel back billings at a high level, they track very much in line with what you see on subscription versus license. Saket Kalia Got it. That's helpful. And then for my follow-up, Carl, I think you mentioned that you saw good crossgrade activity for maintenance to product subscriptions, which of course is a net neutral to the subs count. Can you just give us a sense for how many of those crossgrade you saw this quarter? And then more broadly, are you still seeing customers from product versions older than five years make that crossgrade? Carl Bass Yes, so let me go backwards. Well, so we didn't see customers from very far back because we didn't run any of the promotions. So the typical kind of legacy promotion where people had to be on subscription already. What I did mention is that in Q3, we were running a similar promotion to the one that we ran in Q1. So again, we'll talk about that 90 days from now and see how many of the legacy customers we can attract. We didn't break out the number on your other question of people who converted, but it was a substantial number. I'll leave it to Scott if he wants to give a number. Scott Herren Yes, the color I'd add to that is, if you think of the quarter that we just closed, we actually saw 2 end of sale surges kind of at the same time. There was -- the normal end of sale surge that -- like we saw in Q4, where it was the last chance for our customer who wanted to buy a Suite perpetual license and there are some buy ahead activity, some pull ahead of future demand for that set of customers. And by the way, we predicted that, I think, pretty accurately versus what the results were. The piece that also happened was, of course, when we saw your last perpetual license, you also saw your last crossgrade. And we saw a lot of the same behavior that we saw at the end of -- if you remember when we stop selling upgrades in our fiscal '15, so more than a year ago, we saw a big spike in demand for people who were already using our product, but decided they wanted to upgrade to a more full functioned product. They're willing to pay more for it. We saw some of that same upgrade-like behavior happen within our crossgrades. And I think that's the piece that surprised us a bit and it's a positive for ARR. It's a neutral for subscribers because you had to be on maintenance to be eligible for the crossgrade, but it's a positive for ARR and it's a positive for total revenue going forward. So that's the way I would think about the surge we saw at the end of this quarter. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Richard Davis from Canaccord. Richard Davis So it sounds like -- I mean, you're getting good growth as you kind of pointing out, reduced piracy and also kind of changed vendors. The question that I hear, when you hear from people thinking about changing vendors is a big hurdle is just kind of the data migration and things like that. Has there been any -- have you guys done anything technologically to make that less painful? Because if I have a model set and a different vendor, I'm terrified that if I move it over to you guys, it will incinerate me or something like that. So that's really kind of -- help me understand how you can make that less fearful for these folks trying to... Carl Bass Yes. Despite the advice of our legal counsel, I can guarantee you it will incinerate you, Richard. Let me just divide the markets and talk about the dynamics slightly differently. In the AEC market, which is more project based, it comes up for a building or a roadway or a bridge. There is more willingness -- there is slightly more willingness to shift with new projects as new teams come together. I think the place where you hear even greater reluctance is in manufacturing. And there we did -- we've done a number of things that we've rolled out across our product portfolio that allow customers to work in new software and access the data that they created over the last couple of decades. So they can work with the native data. They don't -- obviously, as always, we can translate it and convert it. But even more importantly, we now let customers leave their data in the native data format and work on it whether they're doing modeling or visualization or simulation. So that's been, over the last two years, a pretty big breakthrough in giving people a much smoother ramp to go from one of the legacy products to a new one. And at a certain point, one of the other things that has to happen in motivating people to move to something is the new stuff has to be that much better. If you think about it, particularly manufacturing, many of the products that people are using are more than 20 years old. And we would like to think in the industry that we can do better than having 20-year-old products be state of the art. So part of it is making the new products and the new product experiences much more compelling. The other is to reassure people about being able to migrate their data or to use all their data and access it for as long as they need to. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Shateel Alam This is Shateel Alam in for Heather. First one is on expenses. So your expenses were down 4% this quarter and you lowered guidance for the year. Can you talk about some of the actions you've taken that are driving this spend to be lower than you're expecting? In the past, you talked about discontinuing some noncore products in trade of hardware. Just wondering if we could see more of that. Are you done with that type of product streamlining? Carl Bass The two biggest places have clearly been on consolidation of the product portfolio, and the second place is in, I just say, overall in our go-to-market activities. As it refers to the product portfolio, I mean, we're on a multi-year transition to a much more streamlined portfolio, including making the end of life of certain products. But also, as you look at collections as a big simplification from suites, all across the board, we're trying to simplify the portfolio, make it easy on customers, make it easy on our partners. And so you'll continue to see the folding in of certain functionality into the products that we keep going forward, the elimination of some of the older and less important ones. And we're constantly pruning for the things that work and don't work. So I would not, at all, expect to see -- or said more positively, I would expect to see that same kind of proactive management of the portfolio for the next couple of years. Shateel Alam Got it, that's helpful. And then for my follow-up, new model subs, the additions of 125 was higher than we're expecting. Can you just give some color on the mix that was traditional, desktop and EBA versus new cloud offerings? And are we starting to see new cloud subs become a higher portion of the adds now? Scott Herren Yes, Shateel. This is Scott. We had a record, I think, Carl mentioned this actually in the opening commentary. We had a record quarter for cloud sub adds, so it continues to move along nicely. But that new model space will continue -- did this quarter and will continue into the future to be dominated by product subscriptions, so term licenses. In fact, for the first time, we had more inventory of product subscriptions within the new model type than of enterprise coming out of the EBAs. So think of it as being dominated by product subscriptions, EBAs would be next, cloud would be next. Shateel Alam Great. Thank you. Thats helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen and Company. Gregg Moskowitz Okay. Thank you very much and good afternoon. Carl, if you look at Asia Pac, customers there have historically moved more slowly to adapt to our subscriptions. In the Q1, however, you did reference, I think, an uptick in new model subscriptions towards the end of that period. Can you give us an update on what you saw out of Asia in Q2? Carl Bass Yes. I mean, I will continue to say that parts of Asia are slower to adopt the new model. We've had some pockets of success with some of our traditional partners in some of the electronic channels that have been more positive, but overall, slightly slower adoption with a handful of countries. And as you do the analysis, it's a little bit hard to dissect exactly what's going on since up until now, the preference of the channel partners kind of shown through and that they were able to exert certain forces on the customers. Moving forward, that goes away so, hopefully, everyone will be aligned. It's a great relief to make it to August 1 and get into just the new model. And I suspect going forward, we'll see more normalization. But given that there were two choices, Asia Pac certainly lagged a little bit. Gregg Moskowitz Okay, that's helpful. And then just for Scott, based on where you are at this point in the year, you're calling for about 250,000 or so net subscribers in the second half, at least, at the midpoint of the range. And I know you don't guide quarterly, of course, but maybe you can just share with the group your high-level thoughts around net adds for Q3 as compared with Q4 as you see it today. Thanks. Scott Herren Yes, sure, Gregg. We always have a seasonal pattern of demand. If you think of where the subs will come into the second half of the year, there will be more than 100% of what we add will be new model, right. Maintenance will be on a continual slow, but on a steady decline. So all of the new adds will come from new model types. New model types tend to have the same seasonality as a lot of our, previously, our perpetual license did. So heavier in Q4 than in Q3 would be normal demand pattern. We also see Q4 typically heavy on EBA sales, although as you see in the last couple of years, we sell a lot of them in Q4, the EBAs will pick up those subs in Q1. So think of this as being driven -- the Q3 versus Q4 driven by our normal seasonality pattern first. And then secondarily, we do think was were some demand pulled forward from some of the end of sale of suites at the very end of Q2 that probably makes Q3 from a sub adds standpoint a little bit more challenging than what we'd normally expect with normal seasonality. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Citigroup. Ken Wong Great. Thanks for taking my question. My first question for you, Carl, with collections now, it's been out in the market for about a month. How should we think about kind of the customers you're attracting here? Is it customers that are using a few products moving up to collections? Or are you seeing your traditional suite customers kind of recognize the incremental value with this comprehensive bundle, and those are ones that are primarily moving towards collections? Carl Bass Yes, Ken, it's probably just a little too early to know for sure. And it's almost like give us the two more months. In this first month, we have certainly seen some of the suites customers move over. Some of the buying at the end of the quarter was anticipation of being able to move from suites to collections. So there's certainly some of that in there, but we'll be able to do a little bit better breakdown of the customers when we get a little bit more traction there. It's just a little bit premature. Ken Wong Got it. And then earlier in your prepared remarks, you mentioned at some point convert to a single subscription offering. Is this just consistent with what you guys have said in the past where just kind of a natural bleed off of maintenance and then you eventually just be all kind of new model subs? Or is there something more specific that you guys are looking to do to try to converge that process sooner? Carl Bass Two things. I think we're being more direct in a general sense, but it's probably, at this point, we don't want to give more details. But what we do know and we have talked about the complexity and the expense that comes with multiple models. And so we'll continue to look at ways to just simplify all of the offerings and merge the programs into one as it makes sense. But I think we were, at least, hinting at more proactive behavior on our part. Scott Herren Yes, Ken, the only color I would add to that is you've seen us do some of this already, first, with suites and now with collections. You see us bundling together to kind of ease the ramp from -- you see us bundling the Windows-based, whether it's perpetual license or product subscriptions, with cloud to kind of ease that on-ramp. And I think you'll see us continue to do more of that to make it easier to consume, to give customers a choice within what they ought to execute, whichever product type that they like. That was one of the guiding tenants with the way we design collections, and I think you'll just see that continue. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Steve Ashley Hi. Most of my questions have been asked, but let me ask about Japan. Just maybe color on what is going on there. And is there, trend-wise, any hope or any color on that would be great. Carl Bass I'd say flat line. It is what it is. It hasn't gotten better and it hasn't gotten worse. Scott, would you want to... Scott Herren I think, that's right. I think, the year-on-year impacts in Japan are probably more pronounced than elsewhere because they were slower last year to adopt a new model type, so the falling off a cliff of going from perpetual license to new model types is more pronounced in Japan than it is elsewhere. I think that's part of what we're seeing. Part of it is just the continuation of the trend that we've seen where it's been a tough economy in Japan, and we feel some of that. And I think it's -- so no change is what I'd say, Steve. But I think part of what we're feeling from a year-on-year standpoint is just the difference in the adoption model. Steve Ashley And then in terms of the promotions you're running, you've been great about calling out the fact that you are running a fairly aggressive promotion less discounting than we saw in the first quarter. But in terms of digital marketing and how much wood you're putting behind the arrow, is there any difference in how visible you will be with this promotion versus the one you ran in the first quarter? Carl Bass Yes, Steve. What I said, last time, we thought the promotion was generous, but not well known by all of our customers. And after having run it in that one quarter, we thought we could turn the two knobs and turn down the discounting and turn up the awareness. And as we said a quarter ago, we were extremely pleased and surprised by the results at how far back into a legacy user base we could reach. And that was with, I'd say, minimal awareness. And so we would like to promote that more heavily going forward, and we thought we could accomplish both goals of greater SRP realization and a good response by just turning up the awareness. So you should see a little bit more of it. And as we indicated in the opening commentary, you can see more of it going forward. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. Given the fact that suites were a bigger part of sort of what was going on in this quarter, you talked a lot about a lot more new model subscription types coming from suites. I would have expected the ARPS number, the pricing side of the equation start to improve. But by my math, it's still down sequentially a little bit both on maintenance and new model subs. One -- as a two-part question, one, why has that continued to decline? And two, when should we expect that to turn back up and start being one of the drivers of ARR growth? Scott Herren Yes, Keith. We talked about this I think last quarter as well. Part of what's going on there is just the math. When you do the ARPS calculation, you're taking a quarter average ARR and dividing it by a quarter end sub count, right? So if you go back and say quarter average ARR divided by quarter average sub count, you'll get a different answer on that. But I think overriding longer term, you do need to expect for some period of time that to continue to come down. And it will come down simply driven by mix. We've talked about ARPS being very mix sensitive. It will continue to be mix sensitive. And as we get further out and layer on more quarters of selling suites and collections in our higher-priced products only in the new model way, you'll begin to see that ARPS rebound. But short term, we'll continue -- that pool will be more heavily dominated by the lower-priced LT and AutoCAD, things that have been out there only as product subs for the last six months. That's the way you ought to think about it. Very mix sensitive. Carl Bass And to be a little bit more quantitative about it, I would look out about three quarters before we probably saw the inflection. Keith Weiss Okay. And that's just because -- that's what I was going to how long it will take for the demand on the suite side of the equation or now the collection side of the equation to really ramp up and sort of normalize that mix? It felt like once you end perpetual for suites and all the new buying for those high-end products becomes new model, that should start sort of inflecting that number upwards? Scott Herren Yes, you've got to layer in multiple quarters of that ARR, Keith, before it gets -- it becomes as representative of the total new model ARR as the things that have already been out there for two or three quarters selling it only in a new model way. So that's the reason you see the lag. It starts now, but there'll be a lag effect before you get that entire pool properly representing what the new sales look like. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Brent Thill Thanks. Scott, the midpoint of the guide looks like there's a little sequential growth from Q3 to Q4. Can you just explain why that is? Scott Herren One of the benefits of the shift that we're taking is we have a lot more clarity on day one of a quarter of what the reported revenues are going to look like. So as we look at both what we already have in deferred revenue for Q3 and what's sitting in backlog, we've got very high coverage of the number that we forecast for Q3 and obviously, a higher degree of certainty on that. As we get closer to Q4, we'll be in that same position on Q4, and we can evaluate if it makes sense to go up at that point. Brent Thill Okay. And just a follow-up on the ARPS question. It was down 7%. I mean, should we continue to expect over the next couple of quarters that to be down mid-single digit? Is that kind of a good way to think of it? Or should we think on the higher end of this? Scott Herren Yes. Let me start, Carl, and you can add color. So think of ARPS at a minimum in the two line items, maintenance separate from new model. New model will have the trend that I just talked about, to Keith on the prior question, right? It will take a couple of quarters for that entire pool of new model ARR to be representative of the new sales that are going on. On the maintenance side, I think, you'll see the ARPS there rebound a little bit quicker. We will see -- we'll continue to see higher renewal rates on suites, and the suites will become a bigger part of the pool faster. So it may be a quarter out, it may be two quarters out, but I think you can expect to see ARPS rebound a little bit more quickly on the maintenance side than on the new model side. Carl Bass Yes, I would agree directionally with Scott, and I would say back to the mix, I think, as we gauge the success of legacy promotions and just the cloud services that will affect the mix as well. So we'll be able to give a little bit more clarity as we go there. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling Auty Thanks. Hi, guys. Given the perpetual sales of suites were higher than you expected in the quarter, is there a way to quantify the unit volume beyond the items you gave earlier? And specifically, what I'm looking for is, is there any chance that, that has an impact on your full year 475,000 to 525,000 subscription addition number because of that pull forward? Carl Bass Yes. So I mean, one is we raised the bottom of the range, which is our indication that we don't think it has any effect. We remain confident in that and I would say, increasingly confident about it. It was interesting to see, and as I tried to highlight in the remarks, as we saw the surge in the perpetual suites, what we also saw was the new model stuff also take off in the last couple of weeks. So we saw higher -- obviously, higher than anticipated volume. And I said when we give back out the extra buying of perpetual suites, it was the volume of activity that we would have expected for this quarter. It was -- it slightly exceeded our expectations. And then on top of that, we also had whatever pull forward. So I think you may see some shifting between quarters on the margin, but we're comfortable with the guidance for the rest of the year. And that's why we're willing to bring up the numbers. Scott Herren Yes, Sterling, I think that's kind of a little -- sorry, just on that last one, a little more context for you around the new model sub adds of 125,000 in the quarter. If you remember back in Q1, new model sub adds were 140,000, but buried in there were two things that didn't recur in Q2. One was the promo. We didn't run that legacy-focused promo in Q2. We will do that again, as Carl said, in Q3. The second is we had a big catchup of the EBAs that rolled in, in Q1 and were a little bit more than 25,000 of that 140,000 we had in Q1. If you net those two out, Q1, without those two, is in the, call it, 90,000 range. That grew to 125,000 new model sub adds in Q2. So I don't -- there's certainly the pull ahead, I don't think, signals any weakness in where we're headed of the new model side.  The only thing to bear in mind is a part of the pull ahead that we saw, a significant part, was driven by crossgrades. And to be eligible for a crossgrade, you had to already be a customer with a maintenance agreement attached. So all of those -- all of that pull ahead business was really neutral to subs. They already have a sub and they have a sub now. So it's not a big piece of that pull ahead. Really doesn't affect the subs growth. Sterling Auty That makes sense. And then the follow-up. Carl, the comment you said that the subscription has accelerated the same time as the perpetual. Were you suggesting that you had customers that were buying both perpetual and subscriptions? Or do you think it was more coincidental to see both accelerating at the same time? Carl Bass I don't  now, I'm speaking a little out of school. We got to do a little bit more work on this. But I don't think it was customers buying both. That's just a little bit of an awkward purchase. I think it was the outreach from our channel partners created demand. And when people decided to buy, then they made the choice. But more likely is they chose one or the other, not both at this point. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Matt Hedberg Sure. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Scott, I've got a modeling question. Now that you're done with the license option for software, how should we think of the trajectory of the run rate of that license line going forward? I think you do allocate some of the subscription sale to license. Is that correct? Scott Herren That is right, Matt. So if you look at that line, there's two components to it. One is perpetual license sales that get immediately recognized and of course, that piece goes to zero. The second is that line is actually a license and other, so there's some -- there's a grab bag of smaller items in there, some legacy products, little bit of consulting in there, so that piece, we've talked about that historically. If you go back a few quarters when we were selling perpetual licenses, that piece being about 10% of the total. That other piece will continue, the perpetual license piece goes to zero. The third piece is what you just said. Both the product subs and the EBAs, of course, when we sell it, it goes immediately into deferred revenue and gets recognized ratably.  But as it comes out of deferred, a portion of it -- because if you think of a term license, the customer is buying two things. They're buying access to the license and they're buying maintenance. So a portion of that deferred revenue accretes back into the license line and a portion of it accretes back into the maintenance line. I know it's confusing. I would love to say that I'm changing that today. We are working on changing that so that it's much clearer for you to be able to see how subscription revenue comes back into a line called subscription. Maintenance is in the maintenance line. And then what's left in license and other really is mostly other at that point. Carl Bass Yes. As I said, it's roughly 80% of the product subscription and 55% of the EBAs get recorded as license revenue. So it's way more than, I think, many people have in their models. And we're doing everything we can to change it and try to clarify it so that it's much clearer in terms of what, I think, everyone would just affectionately refer to as subscription. So we'll try to make this as clear possible, but hopefully, with -- there's two pieces of data. It's a little bit easy for others to model what's going on. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan Hey, guys. Sorry about that. Yeah. Thank you so much. Sorry about that. I wasn't sure if this question has been asked earlier, but I guess, more for Scott. What is your view on the new accounting standard that is being proposed by the FASB being reviewed by the SEC? I think they call it the ASC 606 that particularly applies to software companies that are trying to move into a more ratable model. How much of it does apply to Autodesk? How much of it does not apply to Autodesk? Just curious about your thoughts. Thank you.  Scott Herren Sure, Kash, it applies to everyone. It's not just Autodesk or non-Autodesk. It applies to everyone who's selling software. What we've been doing on that front, and I think we talked about this when you were in town a couple of months ago, we have been very actively engaged on this as we've done everything that we have to shift to a ratable revenue model, the last thing I want is to have that shift back based on the new rev rec guidelines. So our, I guess, he's now our controller has actually been a part of the AICPA task force that's working on clarifying the guidelines for FASB on how that will work. And if you think of a lot of our offerings, they're actually hybrid offerings. There's some term license in there, but there's a lot of cloud-based offering inside there. And so we are committed to continuing to maintain ratable revenue for our product sales for both the product subscription sales going forward -- obviously, cloud is pretty straightforward, and for EBAs. And we're staying very actively in touch with the group as those rules get clarified. Kash Rangan And one follow-up, if I could, for Carl, and I apologize if this question has already been answered. If yes, you don't need to. Any impact that you see from fiscal stimulus if the next presidential cycle brings that forth? Do you think there's any pent-up demand for infrastructure build-out globally and then particularly, in the United States that could help you guys? Thank you. Carl Bass Yes, I mean, anything that's, first, a larger infrastructure spend will be good. I would say just generally speaking, if you look across industries right now, AEC seems strong in all the countries we talked about where the economies are good. Construction in the US is really strong. Northern and Central Europe is really healthy. I mean, if there's political changes, there's more infrastructure spend, that would all be to the good side. We're not counting on it. We've heard that promise before, so -- but it would certainly be to our advantage. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg from Pacific Crest. Monika Garg Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First on the ARR. The ARR growth here was close to 10% but your long-term target is 24% CAGR, right? So this quarter, yes, of course, perpetual is impacting it, but for the next quarter, as you're not filling anymore perpetual licenses, should the ARR growth start trending towards 24% CAGR you've talked about? Scott Herren It will, Monika. That's not intended to be every single year and every single quarter will be 24%, obviously. I know you know that. It's a CAGR over that time frame. You will see ARR growth rates accelerate in the second half of the year, partly, because you see the divergence in the ARR growth rates between maintenance on a slight decline and new model growing 86% year-on-year at constant currency as new model becomes a bigger piece of the total, that drives it up. But also, as we go forward, there will be a higher and higher mix of new model subs. And within that, the subscriptions growth that will continue to drive new model to a significantly higher level. So you will see that begin to accelerate in the second half and continue. Monika Garg Thanks. So on the follow-up side, if you look at the revenue on the platform solution PSEB segment, that has come down Q-over-Q and year-over-year. Is there any reclassification in that segment? Scott Herren There is. It's a continuation of what we've seen over the last several quarters, actually, since we launched suites three years ago, three-plus years ago since we launched suites because what drives the vast majority of that PSEB segment is AutoCAD and LT. And of course, AutoCAD is included in almost all of our -- in fact, it might be in all of our suites that gets sold. And so whats happening is it's not that there's less AutoCAD going out into the world. What's happening instead is there's less of it being sold standalone and therefore, dropping into that PSEB segment and more of it being sold as a component in a suite and in the future, as a component in collections. Operator Thank you. And we have time for one more question today. Our final question comes from the line of Steve Koenig from Wedbush. Steve Koenig Thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. I apologize if this question has been asked. I just wanted to maybe understand probably a little bit your thinking behind collections and your design philosophy for it? And just my background for this question was, we were looking for an offering other than desktop subscription that might be a little bit more appropriate for the mid-market. Seeing some resistance in the mid-market to the subscriptions, more so than for AutoCAD and LTs being sold as DTS in the low end of the market. And yet collections, it looks very much like the desktop subscription. It's a larger bundle at a slightly higher price point. Maybe the question, besides your kind of your intent behind it is, what are the dividing line be in the market between your T-Flex and your EBAs versus Collections when it comes to consuming the suites in terms of kind of company side? Is that how we should think about it and what might that size be? Carl Bass Yes, so the first thing I would say is, so far, we gave a lot of proof points, hopefully, tonight. We haven't seen the resistance. And as a matter of fact, much of -- many of the new products and desktop subscriptions for both suites and collections is being sold through our channel partners, which serves the broadly speaking mid-market. So we think collections are a nice way to both simplify and get people the easy ramp to the new cloud services, so what they're familiar with plus the new stuff. Let me jump to the other side of it is our EBAs -- and as you mentioned, the technology behind it, the T-Flex, is really in the less than the top 1% of our accounts.  So it has a lot of room to grow before these two things run into each other. And what I would add is I would expect to see more flexibility in our product offerings going forward. Collections is really just a first step in the door of what we're going to do in terms of making sure the customers have more flexibility. And that's regardless of how it will be sold. At the same time, we've documented and we've talked about how we really want to see our EBAs go out to a broader audience and how that will grow over time. So we think there's a lot of room between the two right now, and there's actually an opportunity to introduce other offerings that have that level of flexibility from T-Flex. But for example, it can easily be sold by our channel partners. Operator Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Autodesk for any additional comments. David Gennarelli Thanks, operator. That concludes our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, you can reach me, Dave Gennarelli, at 415-507-6033. We'll also be at the Citi conference in New York on September 8. Thanks for joining us. Operator Thank you.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to David Gennarelli, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. David Gennarelli Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal '17. Also on the line is Carl Bass, our CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com/investor. As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments and we will not repeat them on this call. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the anticipated future performance of the Company such as our guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2017, our long-term financial model guidance, the factors we use to estimate our guidance including currency headwinds, our transition to new business models, our customer value, cost structure, our market opportunities and strategies and trends for various products, geographies and industries. We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2016, our Form 10-Q for the period ending April 30, and July 31, 2016, and our current reports on Form 8-K, including the Form 8-K filed with today's press release and prepared remarks. Those documents contain and identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those contained in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made during the call are made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call, but will not provide further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum. During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release, prepared remarks, and on the Investor Relations section of our website. We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Carl. Carl Bass Thanks Dave. We're really pleased with our third quarter results. Q3 marks a significant milestone in our transition. It's the first quarter where we only sold subscriptions and were off to a great start. New model subscriptions grew by 168,000. New model ARR grew 91% at constant currency, and recurring revenue jumped to 76% of total revenue. More generally, we made progress on our two major initiatives growing lifetime customer value by moving customers to the subscription model, and increasing adoption of our cloud based solutions. Given that this quarter was the most uncertain when we started the year, these are fantastic results. So let's look at the details. For the quarter, we added 134,000 net subscriptions. New model subscription additions more than tripled year-over-year to 168,000, while the maintenance subscriptions declined as expected by 34,000 during the quarter. Product subscriptions drove the vast majority of the new models of additions. The launch of industry collections, the next generation of suites that include many of our cloud services contributed to our strong growth this quarter. Collections are a great example of how were simplifying our offerings while increasing lifetime customer value. During the quarter, we ran another promotion aimed at converting our legacy, non-subscriber base to new product subscriptions. Like the promotion in Q1, legacy non-subscribers were offered product subscriptions at a discount when trading in their old perpetual licenses. The Q3 promotion added approximately 43,000 product subscriptions, significantly more than in Q1. In addition the overall average selling price was twice as high as the Q1 promotion due to a lower discount and the fact that customers favored higher price products. And lastly, more than 50% of the subscribers tuned in licenses that were seven years back or older. This reinforces our view that there are meaningful number of active users whose licenses are more than five years old and are interested in moving to the latest software. While the promo successfully migrated many legacy customers to our subscription model, product subscriptions continued to attract a significant number of users that are new to Autodesk. Once again, new customers represented about a third of our new product subscriptions for the quarter. We believe some of these people were previously pirating the software and now have a much more affordable option with product subscriptions. This is consistent with the fact that emerging countries are some of the fastest growing areas for products subscriptions. In other cases, these new users have been using an alternative design tool and should now afford software from Autodesk. Overall product subscriptions grew by more than 30% quarter-over-quarter with new subscribers coming from the legacy base from people previously pirating the software and from new customers switching from other systems. Particularly pleasing is that this strong performance immediately follows the end of sale of perpetual licenses for suites. We also had another record quarter for cloud subscription editions. They nearly doubled from the second quarter which was also a record. BIM 360 and Fusion 360 once again are leading the way, but we also have continued to have success with our other cloud products such as AutoCAD 360, Shotgun, and Collaboration for Revit. It is clear that were building on our leadership in the cloud and that cloud services are growing in importance with our customers. We see the benefits of the clouds inherent scale and connectivity. For example, during Q3 we signed a large BIM 360 contract at a global construction company. Last spring, they started a pilot program, less than 200 seats for new projects. Working with them on their implementation drove rapid adoption. Their results were so strong that they signed the seven figure agreement, expanding their use of BIM 360 Glue, Field and Docs to additional projects, reaching over 2,000 subscriptions in just one region. Now they are planning to scale their BIM processes even further, eventually using BIM 360 for all projects in all regions. Maintenance is our other significant subscription bucket. During the quarter, we included for the first time 13,000 maintenance customers from our acquisition of Solid Angle. As you already know, July 31 was the last time customers could add maintenance to a perpetual license, so the incentive to stay up to date with existing maintenance contracts is compelling. In Q3, the renewal rate for maintenance subscriptions was strong, ahead of last year. But with no new maintenance agreements being sold, total maintenance subscriptions declined. As weve said before, we expect to see ongoing declines in maintenance subscriptions going forward. The rate of decline will vary based on the number of subscriptions that come up for renewal -- the renewal rate and our ability to incentivize maintenance customers to switch over to product subscription. This migration is good for both Autodesk and our customers as it moves them to our newest and best products. While we are still working through the timeline, at some point, we will further simplify our offerings and the maintenance subscription and product subscription offerings will converge into a single program. Now, we will get into ARR. New model ARR growth surged to 91% on a constant currency basis, and reflects the continued strong uptake of all of our new subscription offerings. Total ARR grew 15% at constant currency. ARR growth was negatively impacted this quarter by the allocation of our market development funds, which are accounted for as contra revenue and booked upfront in each quarter. Prior to Q3, these funds were allocated across all revenue streams. But the end of perpetual license sales, a 100% of our market development funds are now allocated to recurring revenues in ARR. This impacted ARR growth by 3 percentage points or about $40 million. FX rates also continued to be a headwind for ARR in the quarter. The combination of FX rates in contra revenues reduced total ARR by about a $100 million or 7 percentage points in Q3, which was sizable. Despite those headwinds, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our FY20 ARR CAGR of 24%. I mentioned last quarter that some of our moves to drive subscriptions in ARR revolve around pricing. In early September we made changes that rationalized the pricing of AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and the AutoCAD verticals. The aim was to drive customers to the right product for their needs and do so with higher billings and ARR. Im pleased to report that these actions are motivating the intended customer behavior. More LT uses are buying [technical difficulty] AutoCAD and the volumes for AutoCAD and especially AutoCAD verticals increased significantly quarter over quarter. For the overall AutoCAD family of products volumes and ARR increased because of these price changes. We focus on subscriptions in ARR as a key metrics to measure our progress in the business model transition. However we have received many [technical difficulty] question on trends in annualized revenue per subscription or ARPs. So I thought I'd spend a little extra time on it this quarter and well spend more time on it at Investor Day next week. Let's start by focusing on new seats added in Q3, excluding the promo seats, as they have the temporary effect of depressing ARPs and so their renewals which will be at the full price. Suite and collections in the U.S. saw a year over year increase in ARPs of 24%. In Germany the increase was plus 79% and in Japan it was plus 26%. AutoCAD LT in the U.S. saw a year over year increase of plus 9%, in Germany the increase was plus 55% and in Japan 50%. The AutoCAD family which is the sum of the newer AutoCAD and the vertical AutoCAD for the U.S. saw a year-over-year increase of 8%. In Germany the increase was 13% and in Japan 78%. Because of the strong year over year changes for new seat purchases the charter over quarter ARPs change for the sum of AutoCAD, AutoCAD vertical and AutoCAD LT in the U.S., Germany and Japan were 5%, 35% and 64% respectively. This was simply the result of more people buying vertical AutoCAD than vanilla AutoCAD and more people buying AutoCAD instead of AutoCAD LT. Exactly the result we were looking for from the pricing change and why we generated more volume in ARR from the AutoCAD family. These are very positive outcomes. In fact except for a few emerging markets in Europe we see essentially the same trendlines everywhere. So why aren't these results reflected in the aggregate ARPs number we report? There are two primary reasons, first the calculation is extremely sensitive to mix in the early stages. Small numbers exaggerate the effects of short term shifts internally, geo mix, promotions, et cetera, until it starts to normalize when the number of customers is large enough. Secondly, the method we use to count ARR and subscription is very sensitive to timing within the quarter. On an as reported basis ARPs can significantly understate the value of a subscription. The net-net of all this is that fundamental business drivers are very positive, but the aggregate ARPs of the company is declining because the various mix impacts, calculations around ARPs, FX and the constant revenue impact of market development funds. In fact factors such as mix drove about 50% of the declining ARPs trends. We expect these impacts to converge to a steady state and thats when youll see aggregate ARPs begin to increase again. We will provide more insight into the components of the new model subscriptions as they mature into a bigger base next year. I know many of you are keenly interested in this area and we will spend a lot more time on this at next week's Investor Day. Total direct revenue also increased as a proportion of total revenues to 29%, up from just 17% two years ago and 25% last quarter. As we continue to grow the volume of business with both our large enterprise customers as well as our e-store. On the expense side we continue to prudently manage spend. Total non-GAAP spend decrease by 2% year-over-year, this marks the third consecutive quarter of decreases as we diligently control our spending. We had already committed to keeping our FY18 spend flat with FY17. We are now committing to keep our FY19 spend flat as well. This will require some additional effort, but we believe it's the right thing to do at this stage of our transition and that we can do so without compromising the long term health of the company. We also remained aggressive with our stock buyback program in Q3, buying back 2 million share with an average price of $68.74. We have now repurchased nearly 7 million share this fiscal year and plan to remain active buyers through both programmatic and opportunistic needs. This is another area, we will discuss in greater depth at our Investor Day on December 6. Overall, we were extremely pleased with our Q3 results. We have increased confidence that the transition is working for customers, partners and Autodesk and that we are on track for the FY20 targets we set. Turning to our outlook, as weve seen over the past several quarters, global conditions have held steady with most of the mature markets performing relatively well while many of the emerging markets have been challenged. As we evaluate our strong Q3 results, and look ahead to Q4, we dont see any meaningful change in the demand environment. Talk of increased infrastructure spending and tax reform in the U.S. would likely benefit Autodesk, but it's far too early to determine if the election results will have a material positive or negative impact on our business domestically or abroad. Our view for the rest of fiscal '17 remains positive. Our revenue and EPS results were slightly better than we expected in Q3. Q4 typically experiences a sequential increase due to seasonality. And we expect to see that again this year. But keep in mind that Q3 revenue benefited from $38 million in backlog from the end of sale of a perpetual suite at the end of Q2. Since weve ended the sale of most perpetual licenses, backlog is now zero and it won't be a material contributor going forward in the subscription only model. We feel great about the way subscriptions are trending and now that Q3 is behind us, we are bringing up the bottom end of our previous range for subscription additions and we are on track for the spend target that we lowered last quarter. When we started down this transition past three years ago, the objective was the same as it is today, build long term shareholder value and establish Autodesk as the leader of the next generation of design and engineering software. We are accomplishing these goals in three simple ways; one, we are increasing the life time value of every estimates by moving them to subscription models. Two, we are changing our cost structure by focusing our product portfolio and go to market strategies. And three, we are building the best cloud and mobile based products and services in the industry with significantly expand our TAM as the underlying technology platform shifts to the cloud. Next week at our Investor Day Event, well provide further detail on significant items on our past to our transition goals including $6 in free cash flow per share in FY20 and $11 in FY22. Some of the items well cover include an update on the transition overall, focus areas that achieve the 20% growth in subscriptions and 24% CAGR in ARR. The factors includes ARPs, TAM expansion opportunities in construction and manufacturing and success with our cloud offerings. The evolution of our go to market strategies to align with the subscription business, recent operating changes that will increase our access to foreign cash and dramatically increase our financial flexibility, and our thoughts on capital allocation.  To round things up, we couldnt be more excited to be finally in the subscription only model. Weve executed well over the past few quarters and were looking forward to finishing the year strong. Our vision and strategy are working. The business model transition is ahead of plans and we are leading the industry in delivering cloud based software for the next generation of design and engineering. With this quarter we become more confident in our ability to increase shareholder value by creating a more predictable recurring and profitable business and achieving the goals we set out for FY20, for subscriptions ARR and cash flow.  Operator we now like to open the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question for today comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Saket Kalia  First just sort of a housekeeping question for you Scott. Can you just remind us what market development funds are from high level and what sort of dollar amount we should expect that to be on an annual basis? Scott Herren Yes, sure. Saket. So market development funds are common to every company that sells through a value added reseller channel. So it's in effect demand generation dollars, it's money that we make available to our resellers for them to go off and drive demand -- presales demand for the product. So its not a new program, weve had market development funds for years. I think what's changed this quarter is the way those market development funds are allocated. They are not treated as an expense, they are treated as a contra revenue, meaning theyre subtracted from our reported revenues. It runs $10 million to $11 million a quarter, and so historically whats happened is that was allocated pro-rata to the sales through the channel which were heavily driven by license sales. This quarter of course, there is no license sales, so all of the market development funds, the same amount we've always spent, ended up being allocated for the first time to recurring revenues, and so the $10 million or $11 million per quarter when you annualize that of course is between $40 and $45 million for the year. So first time, we've seen that effect on recurring revenue was this quarter and I would expect it to stay in that range going forward. Saket Kalia  Understood, that's very helpful. And then for my followup, and I'm sure this is going to be something that we talk about a lot more next week, but how sensitive is the long-term model to mix, meaning can you just talk us through qualitatively maybe how different the mix is across the product ranges in this first quarter with total subscription compared to what you are modeling in that $6 per share in free cash flow, and maybe just qualitatively how much leeway do you have with that mix? Carl Bass Let me start with this and Scott feel free to jump in. We have a variety of mixes that we try to talk about, one was about certainly product mix, one is about geo mix, theres others like term length, and then there are very specific things, the difference between for example, EBAs and maintenance. Those numbers look different as well as certainly the cloud revenues look different. So those things matter a lot, we have a fair amount of flexibility, we understand the price range that these things will come in. Right now were actually above the plan for where we expect it to be and one of the things I tried to do in the middle of the prepared remarks, give you a little bit of information about whats selling on a like-for-like basis. So thats were -- those were those quotes in the middle, all about how much more people are paying this year or this quarter compared to the previous year or the previous quarter. And we thought it was important to really compare the like-for-like, so that people could understand it. One of the things we also mentioned is, going forward well start breaking this out for you, having an average of averages of averages is way too confusing as weve all seen. I think, the folks at Goldman did a nice job at breaking out the model in their most recent report and I think they did a nice job of looking at the stuff we did, though its not identically our model, its closing certainly has the major effects in there, and a good understanding of the time and mix we anticipate seeing and the price ranges. So maybe that helps a little bit. Were going to spend a lot more time next week walking you through this, but hopefully thats a start on the problem. Scott Herren Saket, the other thing that I would add to that is, I think mix is a bigger effect on ARPs right now than it will be longer term, you just need to look at the ARPs for maintenance and youll see its far more steady, because its a much bigger base of maintenance subs, so as the base grows, mix will become slightly less important. I think longer term, the more important metric than ARPs is ARR, and so one of the things well look to do is provide you better insight into where we think ARR is headed, so that ARPs calculation becomes slightly less sensitive.  Carl Bass Next question operator. Karen are you there? Okay, we seem to have lost the operator. Hang on one second while we try to reconnect to her and see if we can keep the Q&A moving. Scott Herren This is a first for me of all the earnings calls Ive done, Ive never had this happen. Operator Im here now. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Steve Ashley I would just like to ask on the promotion, if you could give us some color on how much of that might have been direct versus indirect and what role the e-store might have played in the performance there? Scott Herren Yes Steve, the promotions, you know Carl laid out the success of the 43,000 subs that came through the promotions. It was almost entirely driven through the channel versus through the e-store. Steve Ashley Okay, perfect, and then I would just like to ask about collections and I realize they have not been out very long, but with that you introduced multiuser pricing and that's kind of the first time that's been out there. Wondering if you've gotten any early response to that or if there is any early color you can provide on that new pricing option. Carl Bass You know it's still early. We're trying to replicate some of the things that we had in the previous model. But really I mean it's only a quarter worth of data, so we'll update it more as we go through next year. But we know it is one of the things that customers really want. It's one of the important things you know that whole middle bulk of our customer base has multiple seats , and while we offer lots of flexible offerings for people with large number of seats through the EBAs, people are also looking for it in here, so well update you as we go. Operator Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Shateel Alam Hi, this is Shateel Alam filling in for Heather. Thanks for taking my question. First question was just on new model ARR. That increased by 43 million, I'm not sure if you specifically broke out what the MDS impact was for specifically new model, but first could you break that out and then also last quarters new model ARR increased by 63 million, we're expecting it to increase in size again this quarter, going forward now that your subscription only should we expect new model ARR increase of each quarter to get larger? Scott Herren Yes Shateel, the overall amounts that ARR was affected by the allocation of MBF, again MBF not a new program, but its the first time it's really been heavily allocated, exclusively allocated to recurring revenues thats why we're seeing the impacts so pronounced in this quarter, it was about 40 million on the overall, if you split that between how much was allocated to new model versus maintenance. It's about 6 percentage points on a year on year basis about six percentage points of growth for the MBF impact on new models and about two percentage points of growth reduced by MBF being allocated to maintenance. So overall it was three points, but if you split it between the two it was about six on new model and about two on maintenance. Shateel Alam I just had one follow up on collection. Suites used to represent 30% of your revenues, I'm wondering over time do you expect Collections to also end up representing 30% of total new model ARR and how long do you think it would take for that to ramp to that level? Carl Bass My best guess is that it will be less because of the additional offerings we'll have with you know the cloud offerings and the consumption services tied to things like collections, so I think it will be less, but not substantially so. Operator Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Jay [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst Carl, I'd like to ask you, for my first question a technology question stemming from [indiscernible] University a couple weeks ago, particularly if you could try some of your technology disclosures from two weeks ago to the longer term business implication, in other words, you have some very interesting things to say I thought about your future architecture with the quantum project, you talked about. There are numerous references to what you talked about as a common data environment, new architecture and so forth. So talk about the commercial implication and commercial plans for that as you showed two weeks ago and what that needs for the next number of years in terms of the business model? And then a selling follow up question. Carl Bass Yes, sure Jay [ph]. I mean this goes back a number of years, we have firm believe that engineering software is going to move to the cloud, all design and engineering software will be in the cloud. We started to demonstrate that with the number of products we talked about some like BIM 360, weve shown kind of the basic architecture with products like Fusion 360 and how they take advantage of the connectivity and the compute power of the cloud. So we started to demonstrate that and we started investing in this area three or four years ago. As I have said before while everybody is rightfully focused on the business model transition of our existing business and how we are using it to attract new customers, what I think people will must be surprise about as you look out the next couple of years, if the size of the cloud business that we build, and how we really expands our TAM. So we are going to spend a bunch of time next week showing a little bit more, you were at AU and got to see it, well try to put kind of a an investor look on it, so that people next week can understand what we are doing and what the important is, and why we are investing in the cloud and why this really is the next generation architecture. I have talked in the past about being a place for collaboration as well as giving access to virtually unlimited amounts of compute power which is something our uses demand and so its just a natural fit. It's unusual that engineering has been one of the slowest to move to the cloud, but we see lots of evidence of hitting the tipping point, not just in the U.S. but other places in terms of customers willingness to adopt it. And so next youll hear a bunch more. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from a line of Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen and Company. Gregg Moskowitz Carl, thanks for the additional information on ARPs during your prepared remarks, having said that given where you are today, you do have a lot of grounds and make up to reach 24% ARR CAGR by fiscal '20, can you elaborate on what gives you the confidence that you get there? Carl Bass Part of it is -- the calculation method we chose gives great certainty and repeatability, it's very auditable, but it is a method that can greatly understate the amount of revenue coming in. So one of the things we do and well walk you through this example, but what we actually do is we take the revenue that comes in for the quarter, the recognized revenue which if it's particularly back end loaded, can be close to zero, and we divide it by the number of subscribers at the end of the quarter. So in the extreme if somebody -- so for example, Ill use one example thatll illustrate two points, the promotions were very heavily backend loaded. So you have a low phase offering thats discounted, coming in very close to the end. So what you might get out of that is one day out of 91 worth of revenue, well call it four days out of 365 or slightly less than 1% of the revenue that that subscription is worth, but we divide it by a whole subscriber. So it greatly under stakes the value. Even as we go through this it will normalize as Scott mentioned because the numbers come up -- the numbers get larger and youll get the same effect moving from quarter-to-quarter. In the beginning it's very sensitive to mix its very sensitive is to timing. So were ahead of our plans from where we want to be and while I understand that some people are paying lots of attention to ARPs, I think the better thing to look at going forward and weve tried to stress it as ARR, as Scott mentioned well start giving you guidance on ARR and on the ARPs one well start breaking it out so you dont have to be guessing at the co-efficients between whats in cloud, whats in EBA, whats in product subscriptions and even in the subset that's something like the legacy promotion. We think we can help you understand that a little better, again I'll tell you again one of the reasons we gave the numbers in the middle of the prepared remarks about like-for-like was to show you the increase in pricing that we were seeing and that was both -- there were some numbers that were quarter-over-quarter and somewhat year-over-year and well detail that a little bit more next week at Investor Day, so you can see the thing. And what we think is the like-for-like is the best comparison. Gregg Moskowitz Okay, perfect. Thanks for that detail and I agree that will be helpful and I look forward to that. And then just one for Scott, any update on the timing to potentially change the segment classifications on product subscriptions and EBAs from the hybrid approach to 100% subscription on the income statement? Scott Herren Yes, Gregg fast enough [ph] on that. I would love to have that done now. I think I mentioned on this call last quarter the complication were doing it is, its not the revenue side, its the cog side. We working that very carefully, so the goal will be to end up with three revenue lines instead of the two that we have today, because I recognize the confusion it causes. The three lines would be one for maintenance revenue, one for subscription revenue which ties the new model and one for kind of license and other. As there will still be a small amount of license revenue that comes in. Well have to go through of course it carve up differed revenue and then new revenue going forward, so my goal is to get that done as quickly as possible, I'd look to roll that out next year. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Stan Zlotsky This is actually Stan Zlotsky sitting in for Keith. Thank you for taking our questions. So how much of the churn on maintenance subscription base was driven from maintenance subscribers moving over to desktop subscribers, and a quick follow up what happening with OEM and what are you thinking with the latest on pricing for the maintenance and enticing those customers to move over to become full product subscribers? Thank you. Carl Bass So on the first part we dont know exactly, we use an estimation method that's fairly manual in order to do this and so well try to explain this a little bit next week, but we dont actually know exactly how many set through manual process. And we dont automated it because that will make less and less sense going forward.  While I think I understand the second question was about conversions of the programs? Stan Zlotsky Yes its actually, are you driving pricing increases to entice people to move over from maintenance or are they doing it voluntarily through seeing a greater value proposition of those products or is there a third option [multiple speakers] thinking about? Carl Bass I think both on right now, and an ongoing basis its going to be a combo of the two. Weve some incentives to move people forward we choose to go early. But a lot of it is a value in the new offering, which is the latest and includes large aspects of the cloud in it and gives you those additional flexibilities. So we think there will be a little bit of a push and a little bit of a pull. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Davis from Canaccord. Richard Davis  If Im a firm thats decided the switch to the cloud, to what extend should we thinking about -- is there any risk because this happened with Oracle to some degree, is there any risk that I would consider other cloud option, I mean obviously yes, but have you seen any kind of data that would say, thats an issue or is more just like, listen were going to switch and when we switch I have all my model in Autodesk so Im just going to go to your new model? Thanks.  Carl Bass On the cloud stuff Richard, in terms of having mature viable cloud products to both the AC industry and manufacturing. Were really the only one that have it. You can look out and see some small startups that barely having interaction. We probably have three orders of magnitude, may be four orders of magnitude more usage in the cloud then they do.  So I think for people who are deciding that the cloud has real benefits, I think Autodesk is the natural choice. Weve detailed a little bit at previous times, where we said, more than half and sometimes it was three quarters of the users of Fusion are coming from other mechanical CAD packages. So its not just our users, who are adding on cloud capabilities, its really to attract new users. The second part of it is, one of the things we did when we introduced our cloud products is we made sure they werent only direct competitors with what we already did. But it was to extend the market. So if you look at BIM 360, BIM 360 wasnt a replacement for Revit, it was to extend having model based design go all the way out to the job site and reach all the construction workers. Those are the kind of things were trying to do, is expand the reach of our products, because of the more natural platform. And I think youve seen the same things in other parts of enterprise software with SaaS offerings, where people are expanding into parts of the company, that their legacy applications would have never go to. And I think its identical in the design and engineering world. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from a line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling Auty  Carl, your prepared remarks you did touch upon the infrastructure possibility in terms of the new administration. Can you level set for us if you were to just give us a rough estimate, what percentage of the Autodesk business at this point is infrastructure related and how should we think about that within the U.S.? Carl Bass You know just for construction or broadly speaking the AC business, think of it as roughly around 50% and then you can take the fraction that's the U.S. part of that and go from there. And of course Mexico's going to be building the wall, so I guess we can extend to the rest of North America. So that's about the reach of it, you know it's the American part which is about a quarter on about 50%, something like that. I'd put it in the 10% to 15% range.  Sterling Auty  Okay fair enough and then can you give us an update, so you touched upon the e-store a couple of times, the Analyst Day last year you talked about a lot of the improvements that you were making in North America the initiatives to move international with the e-store, where are you on those initiatives and you know are you at a point yet where you can start to break out how much of the revenue is actually coming through the e-store. Scott Herren Tell you what Carl I'll start and you can jump in. We have -- of course e-stores everywhere, weve launched our own e-stores now across North America and in most of Europe. The e-store continues to grow. We talked about the proportion of our sales that were direct versus indirect grew to the high 20s this quarter, I think 29% up sequentially from 25% just last quarter and 17% a year ago. So it continues to grow as a proportion of total sales and I think we'll continue to see that happen not so much because we're guiding people there, it's that style -- when you get to a subscription model buying direct is a style of interaction that customers want to have with the company much more so than when I renewed my subscription to the Wall Street Journal, I don't walk down to a bookstore to do that. I go to WSJ.com and do that renewal and I think we're going to see more of that business move in that direction. Operator Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities. Monika Garg Hi, thanks for taking my question you know how much revenue in the quarter came from indirect channel and where do you think channels could be as percentage of revenue over the next couple of years. Scott Herren Yes, Monika that's the data point I was just trying to give. So the direct channel in the quarter was 29% of sales and up from 25% last quarter, where that goes longer term it actually is a topic that we'll talk about again next week, but I don't think our view has changed much from the perspective that we had a year ago, which was as we get off the fiscal '20 we think the channel continues to be a significant part of our sales in terms of absolute dollars we think there are more dollars of sales going through the channel in fiscal '20 than there were in fiscal '16. But in terms of a percent of pie, the percent of the total sales that get done, it'll be a smaller percent by the time we get out there. So I think we'll see a case where the channel has a place where absolute dollars of revenue growth, by the way probably fewer channel partners out there than we have today, so it's a more profitable business for the channel partners that remain but as a percent of product sales it will come down pretty significantly from where it is. Monika Garg Got you, thanks. I have a question, on the final call Carl you talked about a lot of question on that already on the call. So if I look Q-over-Q ask for new model are down almost 10% in spite of the fact that collections were slow on subscription due to higher our revenue of per suite items, so why would that be the case and then, seven straight quarters of ARPs for new model being down? Carl Bass Generally speaking we have continued to add lower price products as we build this out. We started with the lot of EBA, we started with a lot of transactions going through the e-store. But we also went through, when you have backend loaded quarters, you greatly understate the value of that subscription. It's why during the thing I try to breakout how the prices were increasing for like-for-like products going forward. And I think thats going to be an important one. What you are getting is, youre trying to look at in average and guess the component pieces and rather than having you guess what we said we would do next year, is break it out so that you can actually see. In the interim what we did is we gave you some numbers for showing that the prices are actually increasing, even if the calculation methodology in the mix is heading down. As we said just some of the mix issues were responsible for 50% of the decline, so mixing time plays a big role here and remember how I just described that calculation that if you buy something at the end of the quarter for example on the last day, it greatly undervalues what that subscription is worth over the long term. At the quarter end which we had a fair amount of promotion and the promotion was backed loaded, you are going to see that. But Ill reemphasis again, the prices of like-for-like, for people buying the same thing that they bought last quarter or a year ago, those prices are going up significantly. And I highlighted how they were going up significantly across the world. Scott Herren Yes, Monika what I would add, and again we will spend more time on this next week. If you go back to new model subscription sales a year ago, it was a small number, they were largely in mature markets, healthy mix of monthly and annual as well as many of them came through the e-store, the channel is still largely focused on selling perpetual licenses at that point. What we have seen over the last several quarters is a pretty significant uptake of new model subscription sales and I am talking about products subscription sales now, pretty significant uptake of those in emerging markets, which I think is healthy for the business. Certainly I would expect some of those to be recapture of pirates in those emerging markets, but as that happens of course those are lower priced, so thats a headwind on ARPs. We see a lot more long term sales of product and lot less monthly, frankly we had a lot of tow dippers coming in monthly previously, previously we now have a lot more annual and multi-year. Again good for the business, but that monthly subscription price is about 50% higher than the annual subscription price, the monthly times 12 is about 50% more than annually. So that mix shift again good for the business not necessarily good for ARPs, its a headwinds, and then as the channel has gotten really engaged and is driving this, so a higher proportion of the sales of products subs come through the channel then a year ago were many of that things sold off to e-store again I think that's a positive for the business it gives us scale but it cuts into ARPs. So three trends that are very positive for our business and positive for the long-term ARR growth, but all that cut against growing ARPs in the short-term. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Citigroup. Ken Wong  Carl you mentioned the convergence of maintenance and rentals early and I think you might have been heading down the path on one of the earlier questions, but could you give us some color on some of the moving pieces of that particular convergence? Carl Bass Yes, there are number of things that we've talked about. So one is if you look out to kind of call it FY20 we want to be in a place where first of all we have really a single kind of offerings with a single back office and infrastructure to support it. One that will be a combination of subscriptions, product subscriptions as you see it plus a consumption model on top of it. That's where we see the business heading. Along the way it's how do we motivate customers to move from one model to another thats actually in the program, what are the price points, how does that transition working and well talk a little bit more about this next week. But in our mind getting to a single model is really important, it will give the best service to our customers it will be the most affordable us to have, we can start getting rid of some of the systems that were designed for a different era and be able to really concentrate on giving a world class experience for what users are trying to do today. So as we go through the next couple of years well talk about how we do that and how we do that the most prudence and responsible way. Ken Wong Got it, looking forward to next weekend then. And then building on Stan's question around maintenance and just renewal, any rough sense of the magnitude of renewal that are coming up in Q4 relative to Q3? Scott Herren Yes, sure Ken. So renewals tend to be on the anniversary of when the license was sold and of course Q4 as far has been our biggest quarter, we've sold the most perpetual licenses over -- if you look back over the last several years we saw the most in Q4. So we have a significant renewal base that comes up during Q4 that I would go back though and highlight what Carl mentioned in the script, renewal rate is actually stronger this year than it was last year. So yes we're seeing a decline to the absolute numbers, but it's not driven by decline in renewal rate, it's driven by the rate at which the maintenance agreements come up for renewal and then in some cases we are incentivizing them and successfully moving them over to new model. Carl Bass Yes, well also see an effect in Q4 some people moving to EBAs. As we've talked about we are really encouraging our large customers to move to EBAs and there is an issue in which we dont count the subscribers until the following quarter. You might have seen this in Q1 of this year and the same phenomena will go on. So particularly if someone goes from being a large maintenance customer to an EBA customer you will see some of that attendance to depress the number of maintenance customers and you will see the corresponding increase, but you wont see it till Q1. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig from Wedbush Securities. Steve Koenig I apologize if this question has been asked, hopefully it hasnt. Im wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on your expectation for subscriber -- subscription counts, which implies acceleration in the out years. May be if you could give us a little color on -- or a ranking of the factors that will drive that, when you think about things like piracy and cloud et cetera. Whats going to drive that acceleration that you guys are looking for and to what extend are you starting to see those things kick in? Carl Bass So in the kind of the existing business, what were really looking for is the three places we saw at this time, one was legacy, one is piracy and one is new customers. And I think weve seen this effectiveness. Weve been able to detail the effectiveness of the legacy programs very specifically. Piracy is a little bit harder, unlike legacy where people claim to be a legacy customer, people dont claim to be former pirates. So it make it a little bit difficult to identify them as former pirates, but we do have our ways. I expect to see more from that and like we said about a third of the customers coming are new customers. In terms of the other things that we see is, good growth amongst our enterprise customers in terms of EBAs in the size of those and then the whole new category of cloud customers and consumption. So you both have cloud customers and then consumption models where people kind pay as they go for various services. Many of them will be tired directly to cloud products but many will be consumption, based into things like the Collections. So for example if someone is doing simulation or rendering in a collection, they will get some amount with it and if they wanted use extra they will pay as they go. So thats where were expecting to see that. Steve Koenig  Got it, Ill leave it at that, thanks Carl.  Carl Bass And next week youll see a bunch more about it, but right now our cloud business is doing incredibly quickly, were really pleased with the growth were seeing in the cloud business. Well talk more about which customers were getting with the cloud business and why that expands the margin. Operator Our next question from the line of Brent Thill from UBS.  Brent Thill Carl you mentioned a third of the subscribers are now coming from new customers. Im curious what may be most surprising to you, what youre seeing in terms of switchers from the competition, Greenfield, old users, pirate, how do you put the community together and highlight where you seeing the strongest numbers of new users coming into the platform? Carl Bass I probably put in, probably in that category, I have to guess, like I said, right now were doing a bunch of manual work to figure out all the new customers, how many were really free [ph] weve seen before versus those who pirated the software. So were trying to understand that dynamic a little bit more, and then well talk a little bit more about that. As a rough guess, one of the ways to think about it, weve talked about this before. For every legitimate user out there, there is about one, slightly more than one user who's not paying for the software, so my guess would be, as we made some of these offerings more affordable from an upfront perspective we're attracting a fair number of the pirates. So the piracy base is probably bigger than we originally anticipated, you know kind of last year when we laid out these goals. The second thing is the legacy base is probably bigger than we laid out last year at this time. We saw it in terms of the distribution throughout the years again you know the mid-point is again around seven years. So we're seeing a fair number of people who are historical users. So on both those fronts we're kind of pleased. You know the Greenfield is a little harder to identify for certain, the other ones we have a better chance at, but we'll give you a little bit more color on this as we go and we get the numbers.  Like I said at a certain point it won't actually matter, but we are looking at both piracy as well as maintenance customers who are moving over. Brent Thill And just a quick follow up, you've been talking a lot about you know the make process, you can bill it, but then you got to make it and you mentioned in the past it hasn't been a big -- maybe as big a piece of revenue could be a lot bigger in the business. Can you maybe just update us in terms of what you're seeing on that core area? Carl Bass Yes. So for example you know a lot of -- I mean we're seeing a number there, in the AC area you know particularly with products like BIM 360, BIM 360 really is communicating with all of our nontraditional customers involved in the process. If things like our structural analysis software for the architects and engineers BIM 360 encompasses the entire workflow, all the way from architects to general contractors, to subcontractors and next week we'll go through a bunch of deal, a bunch of what we're doing there and how it's reaching people that are actually on the construction site, building stuff. When you look at the other things like manufacturing Fusion 360 as well as all of our advanced manufacturing products are really very specifically about you know the next part of the process, Ive kind of joked, but we're helping people make beautiful digital prototypes things that stay on that side of the glass, but you know our customers get paid for making real things. And so what we started doing a number of years ago is starting to helping them in that process, of taking it from one side of the screen to the other side of the screen and we have you know lots of stuff going on in composite materials, a lot we have going on with machining, communicating on the factory floor as well as the construction site, those are all expansions of the market and we'll spend a fair amount of time. We generally spend most of our time and probably appropriately so, as people have been very interested in the business model transition, but like I said this is a growing and very important part of the business and as people look you know to the next couple of years theyll become increasingly important. So we'll give you some more details. Operator Thank you, and that concludes our question and answer session for today, I would like to turn the conference back over to Autodesk management for any closing comments. David Gennarelli Thanks Karen, that will conclude our call today, as Carl mentioned we do have our Investor Day next week, next Tuesday the 6th, it's going to be at our gallery in San Francisco and after that we'll be at the Barclays conference in San Francisco on December 8th, if you need to reach me, you can reach me at 415-507-6033 or email me with any questions. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

[Operator Instructions] And our first question for today comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Saket Kalia  First just sort of a housekeeping question for you Scott. Can you just remind us what market development funds are from high level and what sort of dollar amount we should expect that to be on an annual basis? Scott Herren Yes, sure. Saket. So market development funds are common to every company that sells through a value added reseller channel. So it's in effect demand generation dollars, it's money that we make available to our resellers for them to go off and drive demand -- presales demand for the product. So its not a new program, weve had market development funds for years. I think what's changed this quarter is the way those market development funds are allocated. They are not treated as an expense, they are treated as a contra revenue, meaning theyre subtracted from our reported revenues. It runs $10 million to $11 million a quarter, and so historically whats happened is that was allocated pro-rata to the sales through the channel which were heavily driven by license sales. This quarter of course, there is no license sales, so all of the market development funds, the same amount we've always spent, ended up being allocated for the first time to recurring revenues, and so the $10 million or $11 million per quarter when you annualize that of course is between $40 and $45 million for the year. So first time, we've seen that effect on recurring revenue was this quarter and I would expect it to stay in that range going forward. Saket Kalia  Understood, that's very helpful. And then for my followup, and I'm sure this is going to be something that we talk about a lot more next week, but how sensitive is the long-term model to mix, meaning can you just talk us through qualitatively maybe how different the mix is across the product ranges in this first quarter with total subscription compared to what you are modeling in that $6 per share in free cash flow, and maybe just qualitatively how much leeway do you have with that mix? Carl Bass Let me start with this and Scott feel free to jump in. We have a variety of mixes that we try to talk about, one was about certainly product mix, one is about geo mix, theres others like term length, and then there are very specific things, the difference between for example, EBAs and maintenance. Those numbers look different as well as certainly the cloud revenues look different. So those things matter a lot, we have a fair amount of flexibility, we understand the price range that these things will come in. Right now were actually above the plan for where we expect it to be and one of the things I tried to do in the middle of the prepared remarks, give you a little bit of information about whats selling on a like-for-like basis. So thats were -- those were those quotes in the middle, all about how much more people are paying this year or this quarter compared to the previous year or the previous quarter. And we thought it was important to really compare the like-for-like, so that people could understand it. One of the things we also mentioned is, going forward well start breaking this out for you, having an average of averages of averages is way too confusing as weve all seen. I think, the folks at Goldman did a nice job at breaking out the model in their most recent report and I think they did a nice job of looking at the stuff we did, though its not identically our model, its closing certainly has the major effects in there, and a good understanding of the time and mix we anticipate seeing and the price ranges. So maybe that helps a little bit. Were going to spend a lot more time next week walking you through this, but hopefully thats a start on the problem. Scott Herren Saket, the other thing that I would add to that is, I think mix is a bigger effect on ARPs right now than it will be longer term, you just need to look at the ARPs for maintenance and youll see its far more steady, because its a much bigger base of maintenance subs, so as the base grows, mix will become slightly less important. I think longer term, the more important metric than ARPs is ARR, and so one of the things well look to do is provide you better insight into where we think ARR is headed, so that ARPs calculation becomes slightly less sensitive.  Carl Bass Next question operator. Karen are you there? Okay, we seem to have lost the operator. Hang on one second while we try to reconnect to her and see if we can keep the Q&A moving. Scott Herren This is a first for me of all the earnings calls Ive done, Ive never had this happen. Operator Im here now. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Steve Ashley I would just like to ask on the promotion, if you could give us some color on how much of that might have been direct versus indirect and what role the e-store might have played in the performance there? Scott Herren Yes Steve, the promotions, you know Carl laid out the success of the 43,000 subs that came through the promotions. It was almost entirely driven through the channel versus through the e-store. Steve Ashley Okay, perfect, and then I would just like to ask about collections and I realize they have not been out very long, but with that you introduced multiuser pricing and that's kind of the first time that's been out there. Wondering if you've gotten any early response to that or if there is any early color you can provide on that new pricing option. Carl Bass You know it's still early. We're trying to replicate some of the things that we had in the previous model. But really I mean it's only a quarter worth of data, so we'll update it more as we go through next year. But we know it is one of the things that customers really want. It's one of the important things you know that whole middle bulk of our customer base has multiple seats , and while we offer lots of flexible offerings for people with large number of seats through the EBAs, people are also looking for it in here, so well update you as we go. Operator Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Shateel Alam Hi, this is Shateel Alam filling in for Heather. Thanks for taking my question. First question was just on new model ARR. That increased by 43 million, I'm not sure if you specifically broke out what the MDS impact was for specifically new model, but first could you break that out and then also last quarters new model ARR increased by 63 million, we're expecting it to increase in size again this quarter, going forward now that your subscription only should we expect new model ARR increase of each quarter to get larger? Scott Herren Yes Shateel, the overall amounts that ARR was affected by the allocation of MBF, again MBF not a new program, but its the first time it's really been heavily allocated, exclusively allocated to recurring revenues thats why we're seeing the impacts so pronounced in this quarter, it was about 40 million on the overall, if you split that between how much was allocated to new model versus maintenance. It's about 6 percentage points on a year on year basis about six percentage points of growth for the MBF impact on new models and about two percentage points of growth reduced by MBF being allocated to maintenance. So overall it was three points, but if you split it between the two it was about six on new model and about two on maintenance. Shateel Alam I just had one follow up on collection. Suites used to represent 30% of your revenues, I'm wondering over time do you expect Collections to also end up representing 30% of total new model ARR and how long do you think it would take for that to ramp to that level? Carl Bass My best guess is that it will be less because of the additional offerings we'll have with you know the cloud offerings and the consumption services tied to things like collections, so I think it will be less, but not substantially so. Operator Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Jay [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst Carl, I'd like to ask you, for my first question a technology question stemming from [indiscernible] University a couple weeks ago, particularly if you could try some of your technology disclosures from two weeks ago to the longer term business implication, in other words, you have some very interesting things to say I thought about your future architecture with the quantum project, you talked about. There are numerous references to what you talked about as a common data environment, new architecture and so forth. So talk about the commercial implication and commercial plans for that as you showed two weeks ago and what that needs for the next number of years in terms of the business model? And then a selling follow up question. Carl Bass Yes, sure Jay [ph]. I mean this goes back a number of years, we have firm believe that engineering software is going to move to the cloud, all design and engineering software will be in the cloud. We started to demonstrate that with the number of products we talked about some like BIM 360, weve shown kind of the basic architecture with products like Fusion 360 and how they take advantage of the connectivity and the compute power of the cloud. So we started to demonstrate that and we started investing in this area three or four years ago. As I have said before while everybody is rightfully focused on the business model transition of our existing business and how we are using it to attract new customers, what I think people will must be surprise about as you look out the next couple of years, if the size of the cloud business that we build, and how we really expands our TAM. So we are going to spend a bunch of time next week showing a little bit more, you were at AU and got to see it, well try to put kind of a an investor look on it, so that people next week can understand what we are doing and what the important is, and why we are investing in the cloud and why this really is the next generation architecture. I have talked in the past about being a place for collaboration as well as giving access to virtually unlimited amounts of compute power which is something our uses demand and so its just a natural fit. It's unusual that engineering has been one of the slowest to move to the cloud, but we see lots of evidence of hitting the tipping point, not just in the U.S. but other places in terms of customers willingness to adopt it. And so next youll hear a bunch more. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from a line of Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen and Company. Gregg Moskowitz Carl, thanks for the additional information on ARPs during your prepared remarks, having said that given where you are today, you do have a lot of grounds and make up to reach 24% ARR CAGR by fiscal '20, can you elaborate on what gives you the confidence that you get there? Carl Bass Part of it is -- the calculation method we chose gives great certainty and repeatability, it's very auditable, but it is a method that can greatly understate the amount of revenue coming in. So one of the things we do and well walk you through this example, but what we actually do is we take the revenue that comes in for the quarter, the recognized revenue which if it's particularly back end loaded, can be close to zero, and we divide it by the number of subscribers at the end of the quarter. So in the extreme if somebody -- so for example, Ill use one example thatll illustrate two points, the promotions were very heavily backend loaded. So you have a low phase offering thats discounted, coming in very close to the end. So what you might get out of that is one day out of 91 worth of revenue, well call it four days out of 365 or slightly less than 1% of the revenue that that subscription is worth, but we divide it by a whole subscriber. So it greatly under stakes the value. Even as we go through this it will normalize as Scott mentioned because the numbers come up -- the numbers get larger and youll get the same effect moving from quarter-to-quarter. In the beginning it's very sensitive to mix its very sensitive is to timing. So were ahead of our plans from where we want to be and while I understand that some people are paying lots of attention to ARPs, I think the better thing to look at going forward and weve tried to stress it as ARR, as Scott mentioned well start giving you guidance on ARR and on the ARPs one well start breaking it out so you dont have to be guessing at the co-efficients between whats in cloud, whats in EBA, whats in product subscriptions and even in the subset that's something like the legacy promotion. We think we can help you understand that a little better, again I'll tell you again one of the reasons we gave the numbers in the middle of the prepared remarks about like-for-like was to show you the increase in pricing that we were seeing and that was both -- there were some numbers that were quarter-over-quarter and somewhat year-over-year and well detail that a little bit more next week at Investor Day, so you can see the thing. And what we think is the like-for-like is the best comparison. Gregg Moskowitz Okay, perfect. Thanks for that detail and I agree that will be helpful and I look forward to that. And then just one for Scott, any update on the timing to potentially change the segment classifications on product subscriptions and EBAs from the hybrid approach to 100% subscription on the income statement? Scott Herren Yes, Gregg fast enough [ph] on that. I would love to have that done now. I think I mentioned on this call last quarter the complication were doing it is, its not the revenue side, its the cog side. We working that very carefully, so the goal will be to end up with three revenue lines instead of the two that we have today, because I recognize the confusion it causes. The three lines would be one for maintenance revenue, one for subscription revenue which ties the new model and one for kind of license and other. As there will still be a small amount of license revenue that comes in. Well have to go through of course it carve up differed revenue and then new revenue going forward, so my goal is to get that done as quickly as possible, I'd look to roll that out next year. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Stan Zlotsky This is actually Stan Zlotsky sitting in for Keith. Thank you for taking our questions. So how much of the churn on maintenance subscription base was driven from maintenance subscribers moving over to desktop subscribers, and a quick follow up what happening with OEM and what are you thinking with the latest on pricing for the maintenance and enticing those customers to move over to become full product subscribers? Thank you. Carl Bass So on the first part we dont know exactly, we use an estimation method that's fairly manual in order to do this and so well try to explain this a little bit next week, but we dont actually know exactly how many set through manual process. And we dont automated it because that will make less and less sense going forward.  While I think I understand the second question was about conversions of the programs? Stan Zlotsky Yes its actually, are you driving pricing increases to entice people to move over from maintenance or are they doing it voluntarily through seeing a greater value proposition of those products or is there a third option [multiple speakers] thinking about? Carl Bass I think both on right now, and an ongoing basis its going to be a combo of the two. Weve some incentives to move people forward we choose to go early. But a lot of it is a value in the new offering, which is the latest and includes large aspects of the cloud in it and gives you those additional flexibilities. So we think there will be a little bit of a push and a little bit of a pull. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Davis from Canaccord. Richard Davis  If Im a firm thats decided the switch to the cloud, to what extend should we thinking about -- is there any risk because this happened with Oracle to some degree, is there any risk that I would consider other cloud option, I mean obviously yes, but have you seen any kind of data that would say, thats an issue or is more just like, listen were going to switch and when we switch I have all my model in Autodesk so Im just going to go to your new model? Thanks.  Carl Bass On the cloud stuff Richard, in terms of having mature viable cloud products to both the AC industry and manufacturing. Were really the only one that have it. You can look out and see some small startups that barely having interaction. We probably have three orders of magnitude, may be four orders of magnitude more usage in the cloud then they do.  So I think for people who are deciding that the cloud has real benefits, I think Autodesk is the natural choice. Weve detailed a little bit at previous times, where we said, more than half and sometimes it was three quarters of the users of Fusion are coming from other mechanical CAD packages. So its not just our users, who are adding on cloud capabilities, its really to attract new users. The second part of it is, one of the things we did when we introduced our cloud products is we made sure they werent only direct competitors with what we already did. But it was to extend the market. So if you look at BIM 360, BIM 360 wasnt a replacement for Revit, it was to extend having model based design go all the way out to the job site and reach all the construction workers. Those are the kind of things were trying to do, is expand the reach of our products, because of the more natural platform. And I think youve seen the same things in other parts of enterprise software with SaaS offerings, where people are expanding into parts of the company, that their legacy applications would have never go to. And I think its identical in the design and engineering world. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from a line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling Auty  Carl, your prepared remarks you did touch upon the infrastructure possibility in terms of the new administration. Can you level set for us if you were to just give us a rough estimate, what percentage of the Autodesk business at this point is infrastructure related and how should we think about that within the U.S.? Carl Bass You know just for construction or broadly speaking the AC business, think of it as roughly around 50% and then you can take the fraction that's the U.S. part of that and go from there. And of course Mexico's going to be building the wall, so I guess we can extend to the rest of North America. So that's about the reach of it, you know it's the American part which is about a quarter on about 50%, something like that. I'd put it in the 10% to 15% range.  Sterling Auty  Okay fair enough and then can you give us an update, so you touched upon the e-store a couple of times, the Analyst Day last year you talked about a lot of the improvements that you were making in North America the initiatives to move international with the e-store, where are you on those initiatives and you know are you at a point yet where you can start to break out how much of the revenue is actually coming through the e-store. Scott Herren Tell you what Carl I'll start and you can jump in. We have -- of course e-stores everywhere, weve launched our own e-stores now across North America and in most of Europe. The e-store continues to grow. We talked about the proportion of our sales that were direct versus indirect grew to the high 20s this quarter, I think 29% up sequentially from 25% just last quarter and 17% a year ago. So it continues to grow as a proportion of total sales and I think we'll continue to see that happen not so much because we're guiding people there, it's that style -- when you get to a subscription model buying direct is a style of interaction that customers want to have with the company much more so than when I renewed my subscription to the Wall Street Journal, I don't walk down to a bookstore to do that. I go to WSJ.com and do that renewal and I think we're going to see more of that business move in that direction. Operator Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities. Monika Garg Hi, thanks for taking my question you know how much revenue in the quarter came from indirect channel and where do you think channels could be as percentage of revenue over the next couple of years. Scott Herren Yes, Monika that's the data point I was just trying to give. So the direct channel in the quarter was 29% of sales and up from 25% last quarter, where that goes longer term it actually is a topic that we'll talk about again next week, but I don't think our view has changed much from the perspective that we had a year ago, which was as we get off the fiscal '20 we think the channel continues to be a significant part of our sales in terms of absolute dollars we think there are more dollars of sales going through the channel in fiscal '20 than there were in fiscal '16. But in terms of a percent of pie, the percent of the total sales that get done, it'll be a smaller percent by the time we get out there. So I think we'll see a case where the channel has a place where absolute dollars of revenue growth, by the way probably fewer channel partners out there than we have today, so it's a more profitable business for the channel partners that remain but as a percent of product sales it will come down pretty significantly from where it is. Monika Garg Got you, thanks. I have a question, on the final call Carl you talked about a lot of question on that already on the call. So if I look Q-over-Q ask for new model are down almost 10% in spite of the fact that collections were slow on subscription due to higher our revenue of per suite items, so why would that be the case and then, seven straight quarters of ARPs for new model being down? Carl Bass Generally speaking we have continued to add lower price products as we build this out. We started with the lot of EBA, we started with a lot of transactions going through the e-store. But we also went through, when you have backend loaded quarters, you greatly understate the value of that subscription. It's why during the thing I try to breakout how the prices were increasing for like-for-like products going forward. And I think thats going to be an important one. What you are getting is, youre trying to look at in average and guess the component pieces and rather than having you guess what we said we would do next year, is break it out so that you can actually see. In the interim what we did is we gave you some numbers for showing that the prices are actually increasing, even if the calculation methodology in the mix is heading down. As we said just some of the mix issues were responsible for 50% of the decline, so mixing time plays a big role here and remember how I just described that calculation that if you buy something at the end of the quarter for example on the last day, it greatly undervalues what that subscription is worth over the long term. At the quarter end which we had a fair amount of promotion and the promotion was backed loaded, you are going to see that. But Ill reemphasis again, the prices of like-for-like, for people buying the same thing that they bought last quarter or a year ago, those prices are going up significantly. And I highlighted how they were going up significantly across the world. Scott Herren Yes, Monika what I would add, and again we will spend more time on this next week. If you go back to new model subscription sales a year ago, it was a small number, they were largely in mature markets, healthy mix of monthly and annual as well as many of them came through the e-store, the channel is still largely focused on selling perpetual licenses at that point. What we have seen over the last several quarters is a pretty significant uptake of new model subscription sales and I am talking about products subscription sales now, pretty significant uptake of those in emerging markets, which I think is healthy for the business. Certainly I would expect some of those to be recapture of pirates in those emerging markets, but as that happens of course those are lower priced, so thats a headwind on ARPs. We see a lot more long term sales of product and lot less monthly, frankly we had a lot of tow dippers coming in monthly previously, previously we now have a lot more annual and multi-year. Again good for the business, but that monthly subscription price is about 50% higher than the annual subscription price, the monthly times 12 is about 50% more than annually. So that mix shift again good for the business not necessarily good for ARPs, its a headwinds, and then as the channel has gotten really engaged and is driving this, so a higher proportion of the sales of products subs come through the channel then a year ago were many of that things sold off to e-store again I think that's a positive for the business it gives us scale but it cuts into ARPs. So three trends that are very positive for our business and positive for the long-term ARR growth, but all that cut against growing ARPs in the short-term. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Citigroup. Ken Wong  Carl you mentioned the convergence of maintenance and rentals early and I think you might have been heading down the path on one of the earlier questions, but could you give us some color on some of the moving pieces of that particular convergence? Carl Bass Yes, there are number of things that we've talked about. So one is if you look out to kind of call it FY20 we want to be in a place where first of all we have really a single kind of offerings with a single back office and infrastructure to support it. One that will be a combination of subscriptions, product subscriptions as you see it plus a consumption model on top of it. That's where we see the business heading. Along the way it's how do we motivate customers to move from one model to another thats actually in the program, what are the price points, how does that transition working and well talk a little bit more about this next week. But in our mind getting to a single model is really important, it will give the best service to our customers it will be the most affordable us to have, we can start getting rid of some of the systems that were designed for a different era and be able to really concentrate on giving a world class experience for what users are trying to do today. So as we go through the next couple of years well talk about how we do that and how we do that the most prudence and responsible way. Ken Wong Got it, looking forward to next weekend then. And then building on Stan's question around maintenance and just renewal, any rough sense of the magnitude of renewal that are coming up in Q4 relative to Q3? Scott Herren Yes, sure Ken. So renewals tend to be on the anniversary of when the license was sold and of course Q4 as far has been our biggest quarter, we've sold the most perpetual licenses over -- if you look back over the last several years we saw the most in Q4. So we have a significant renewal base that comes up during Q4 that I would go back though and highlight what Carl mentioned in the script, renewal rate is actually stronger this year than it was last year. So yes we're seeing a decline to the absolute numbers, but it's not driven by decline in renewal rate, it's driven by the rate at which the maintenance agreements come up for renewal and then in some cases we are incentivizing them and successfully moving them over to new model. Carl Bass Yes, well also see an effect in Q4 some people moving to EBAs. As we've talked about we are really encouraging our large customers to move to EBAs and there is an issue in which we dont count the subscribers until the following quarter. You might have seen this in Q1 of this year and the same phenomena will go on. So particularly if someone goes from being a large maintenance customer to an EBA customer you will see some of that attendance to depress the number of maintenance customers and you will see the corresponding increase, but you wont see it till Q1. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig from Wedbush Securities. Steve Koenig I apologize if this question has been asked, hopefully it hasnt. Im wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on your expectation for subscriber -- subscription counts, which implies acceleration in the out years. May be if you could give us a little color on -- or a ranking of the factors that will drive that, when you think about things like piracy and cloud et cetera. Whats going to drive that acceleration that you guys are looking for and to what extend are you starting to see those things kick in? Carl Bass So in the kind of the existing business, what were really looking for is the three places we saw at this time, one was legacy, one is piracy and one is new customers. And I think weve seen this effectiveness. Weve been able to detail the effectiveness of the legacy programs very specifically. Piracy is a little bit harder, unlike legacy where people claim to be a legacy customer, people dont claim to be former pirates. So it make it a little bit difficult to identify them as former pirates, but we do have our ways. I expect to see more from that and like we said about a third of the customers coming are new customers. In terms of the other things that we see is, good growth amongst our enterprise customers in terms of EBAs in the size of those and then the whole new category of cloud customers and consumption. So you both have cloud customers and then consumption models where people kind pay as they go for various services. Many of them will be tired directly to cloud products but many will be consumption, based into things like the Collections. So for example if someone is doing simulation or rendering in a collection, they will get some amount with it and if they wanted use extra they will pay as they go. So thats where were expecting to see that. Steve Koenig  Got it, Ill leave it at that, thanks Carl.  Carl Bass And next week youll see a bunch more about it, but right now our cloud business is doing incredibly quickly, were really pleased with the growth were seeing in the cloud business. Well talk more about which customers were getting with the cloud business and why that expands the margin. Operator Our next question from the line of Brent Thill from UBS.  Brent Thill Carl you mentioned a third of the subscribers are now coming from new customers. Im curious what may be most surprising to you, what youre seeing in terms of switchers from the competition, Greenfield, old users, pirate, how do you put the community together and highlight where you seeing the strongest numbers of new users coming into the platform? Carl Bass I probably put in, probably in that category, I have to guess, like I said, right now were doing a bunch of manual work to figure out all the new customers, how many were really free [ph] weve seen before versus those who pirated the software. So were trying to understand that dynamic a little bit more, and then well talk a little bit more about that. As a rough guess, one of the ways to think about it, weve talked about this before. For every legitimate user out there, there is about one, slightly more than one user who's not paying for the software, so my guess would be, as we made some of these offerings more affordable from an upfront perspective we're attracting a fair number of the pirates. So the piracy base is probably bigger than we originally anticipated, you know kind of last year when we laid out these goals. The second thing is the legacy base is probably bigger than we laid out last year at this time. We saw it in terms of the distribution throughout the years again you know the mid-point is again around seven years. So we're seeing a fair number of people who are historical users. So on both those fronts we're kind of pleased. You know the Greenfield is a little harder to identify for certain, the other ones we have a better chance at, but we'll give you a little bit more color on this as we go and we get the numbers.  Like I said at a certain point it won't actually matter, but we are looking at both piracy as well as maintenance customers who are moving over. Brent Thill And just a quick follow up, you've been talking a lot about you know the make process, you can bill it, but then you got to make it and you mentioned in the past it hasn't been a big -- maybe as big a piece of revenue could be a lot bigger in the business. Can you maybe just update us in terms of what you're seeing on that core area? Carl Bass Yes. So for example you know a lot of -- I mean we're seeing a number there, in the AC area you know particularly with products like BIM 360, BIM 360 really is communicating with all of our nontraditional customers involved in the process. If things like our structural analysis software for the architects and engineers BIM 360 encompasses the entire workflow, all the way from architects to general contractors, to subcontractors and next week we'll go through a bunch of deal, a bunch of what we're doing there and how it's reaching people that are actually on the construction site, building stuff. When you look at the other things like manufacturing Fusion 360 as well as all of our advanced manufacturing products are really very specifically about you know the next part of the process, Ive kind of joked, but we're helping people make beautiful digital prototypes things that stay on that side of the glass, but you know our customers get paid for making real things. And so what we started doing a number of years ago is starting to helping them in that process, of taking it from one side of the screen to the other side of the screen and we have you know lots of stuff going on in composite materials, a lot we have going on with machining, communicating on the factory floor as well as the construction site, those are all expansions of the market and we'll spend a fair amount of time. We generally spend most of our time and probably appropriately so, as people have been very interested in the business model transition, but like I said this is a growing and very important part of the business and as people look you know to the next couple of years theyll become increasingly important. So we'll give you some more details.
