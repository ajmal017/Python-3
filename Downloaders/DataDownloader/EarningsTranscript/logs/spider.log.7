Welcome to the Catamaran Corporation's Fiscal 2014 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Financial Results Conference Call. Catamaran has issued an earnings press release this morning, which has been filed with the SEC and is available on Catamaran's website at www.catamaranrx.com. This is a reminder that portions of today's discussion contain forward-looking statements that reflect current views with respect to future events, such as Catamaran's outlook for future performance, revenue and earnings growth and various other aspects of its business. Such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language in the earnings release and Catamaran's filings with the SEC as well as Catamaran's most recent annual report on Form 10-K. During the call, there will be discussion of some items that do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles, including adjusted EPS and EBITDA. Catamaran has reconciled these items to the most comparable GAAP measures in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that this call is being recorded on Thursday, February 26, 2015, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time. A replay of today's call will be available on Catamaran's website approximately 1 hour after the conclusion of the call. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Thierer, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead, sir. Mark A. Thierer Well, good morning, and thank you for joining us on our call today. Earlier this morning, we released our fourth quarter earnings and 2015 guidance, and I'm very pleased with our performance in delivering yet another year of record-setting results. We're really pleased with the points we put in the board in 2014. We delivered $1.2 billion of net new business by articulating our value proposition and selling our differentiated product offering to our prospective clients. We continued to execute on our M&A strategy with our acquisition of Salveo Specialty Pharmacy, which further bolstered our Briova platform. We demonstrated our ability to navigate and deliver on large-scale integrations with Restat and large health plan migrations, while simultaneously solidifying our PBM operations and service levels. As a result of these accomplishments, we're very well positioned for another strong year in 2015. Our January 1 go-live was very, very strong. In fact, we think it was the best in our company's history. This is a testament to the commitment and the dedication of our entire team as well as the strategic investments we made over the last year. Every year, I personally take the time to pick up the phone and connect with our new clients to take the pulse of our new implementations. I ask them what went well, what did not go well and what we could do to improve their process and make it seamless. My conversations this year in January and February were really very good, and the clients had a very positive tone. Our strong implementation performance will result in strong references, that's how this business works, which will serve as a tailwind in the selling season that's currently underway. We're in the early innings of the selling season, which includes pursuing new sales opportunities for 2016 as well as some with 2017 start dates. While still very early, the outlook is encouraging with a healthy level of RFP activity. We have a number of health plan opportunities in process as we speak. As you know, health plans, both large and small, require a longer implementation period due to the sophistication of their plan designs, technology and service configurations and their diverse populations. As we've said before, our unique capabilities, strong technology footprint and flexible product offerings resonate with these sophisticated payers. Regarding client renewals, our goal here at Catamaran is quite simple: 100% client retention. We've consistently reported among the highest retention rates in the industry, but the fact is we do occasionally lose a client. With respect to 2016, we have unfortunately lost 2 health plans, one, a PBM client in the Midwest and one, an HCIT client in the Southeast, both of which we'll continue to service through the balance of calendar 2015. I'd like to make 2 important points. First, we are never happy to see a client leave, but rest assured, we'll continue to provide them our highest service levels during the duration of our contract and ensure a smooth transition for their membership. Second, we are committed to maintaining pricing discipline to deliver shareholder value. We know it's a long road, and our goal is to win their business back. As worth noting, we continue to hear one consistent theme from existed -- existing and prospective clients alike: With the rise in specialty, what can you do to help us manage the overall drug trend? Specialty is, without a doubt, the fastest-growing component of overall drug trend. It represents over 20% of the drug spend today and is expected to be 50% by 2018. We're committed to leveraging our high-touch BriovaRx platform to help our clients manage their specialty spend. From our innovative hepatitis C management program to the upcoming launches of PCSK9s, along with the initial approval of biosimilars in this country, we are laser-focused on leveraging our advanced thinking, with expected changes in the environment to control clients' drug trend, properly manage members' complex conditions and maximize positive outcomes for clients and members alike. Our personalized member-centric approach is delivering real savings for our clients by increasing patient adherence, reducing waste, improving economics to clients and members, and improving clinical outcomes. These patients often suffer from multiple comorbidities, and they're taking specialty medications to manage very complex conditions. We've made it our mission to holistically manage these patients to keep them adherent to their entire regimen, while educating them on their conditions. These are not just scripts to be distributed. These are real people with complex conditions that need experts, helping them maintain or improve their quality of life. At Briova, we take that responsibility very seriously. We stake the claim to over 75 firsts in the PBM industry. Catamaran has always had the reputation for being the most innovative company in the PBM market. Earlier, I mentioned our hepatitis C strategy, which is clearly another first in the PBM space. We were the first to market with an outcomes-based model measured by the guarantee of a treatment delivering on its expected results. What this means is simple: If the expected clinical results are not met and retreatment is required within a specified time period, the client does not pay. We are confident in our ability to promote full patient adherence and drive optimal health outcomes through Briova, and we're putting our money where our mouth is. We've delivered a truly outcomes-based pricing model to the client in this high-cost class of drugs. This is another unique way Briova is managing costs and outcomes for clients and for members. Now turning to the Affordable Care Act. I want to give an update on the 2015 enrollment season and its impact on Catamaran. As expected, we experienced solid member growth during the enrollment season. With our strong presence with the health plans and with CO-OPs, we've been able to grow our membership base by capturing lives. Of the estimated 11 million exchange lives to date, Catamaran is now managing almost 1.3 million exchange lives through our qualified health plans or QHPs, which include our CO-OP clients. As you can see, we've captured an outsized share of the total exchange population due to our unique exchange footprint, coupled with our success in the QHP market. Catamaran has become a trusted partner in this area because of the flexibility we offer to health plan clients when it comes to service offerings, formulary configurations, plan designs and unique network configurations. Consistent with last year, we believe drug utilization with the exchange population will be roughly in line with our commercial segment. We continue to work closely with our health plan clients to ensure they are well positioned to capture new lives entering the system. As you have come to expect, we continue to manage a robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities that complement our core competencies and strengthen our market position in important segments. This morning, we are pleased to announce that we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Healthcare Solutions, a privately held health care services company that delivers comprehensive, integrated solutions to the workers' compensation market for $405 million in cash. Healthcare Solutions is an existing PBM client of ours with whom we've had a long-standing and collaborative relationship. We've spoken to investors for years about the niche markets we serve, including long-term care, hospice, Fee-For-Service Medicaid, managed discount programs and the workers' compensation market. The acquisition of Healthcare Solutions will bolster our strong position in the workers' comp space, which is a unique niche market, and we do like it a lot. The workers' comp market entails complex, state-specific reimbursement models and very unique programs around drug compliance, pain management and abuse. This market also requires dynamic eligibility for the member. For example, a member was covered by a group health plan PBM yesterday, but due to a workplace injury today, the member is now covered by the company's property and casualty insurer, which has contracted with the specialized workers' comp PBM managing unique programs for injured workers. This benefit requires real-time eligibility verification and unique plan design implementations to properly manage the benefit, to control the costs and drive positive outcomes for the member, the employer and the insurer. This is a proprietary functionality inside our RxCLAIM platform that we're able to provide. Healthcare Solutions' core business aligns perfectly with ours, and this acquisition will provide an opportunity to bring our full suite of products and services to the Healthcare Solutions client base. The combination of these 2 organizations will also allow Catamaran to bring a full suite of workers' comp services to our legacy book of business, creating cross-sell opportunities inside both companies. We look forward to bringing the Healthcare Solutions team into the Catamaran family, and Mike will talk to you and walk you through the financial details of this acquisition in a moment, but I'd like to take a moment to welcome Joe Boures and the entire Healthcare Solutions team. We're excited to have you all in the Catamaran family and once we close the transaction, which will be expected to be complete sometime in the second quarter. Now before I turn the call over to Mike, I'd like to acknowledge our entire Catamaran team. 2014 marked another year of record performance. We delivered on our service and estimates throughout the year, which paid dividends for our company well into the future. We delivered on our acquisition strategy with Salveo, and we executed on our stated integration plans. We've set the stage for a very solid 2015 and beyond. As I said before, we have one of the best teams in this business, and I want to thank our team for another year of outstanding results. And now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for a more detailed look at the quarter as well as the underlying assumptions for our 2015 guidance. Mike? Michael H. Shapiro Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter marked another successful quarter as we delivered record results across the board. The fourth quarter cast a very productive year in which we delivered unprecedented revenue, earnings and cash flow. I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through a number of topics, including the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2014, provide an update on our integration efforts around Salveo and pending acquisition of Healthcare Solutions. And finally, I want to lay out the underlying assumptions for our initial 2015 guidance we released earlier this morning. In 2014, we posted record revenues of $21.6 billion, an increase of 46% compared to 2013. In the fourth quarter, revenues increased to $5.7 billion, which represented a 27% lift compared to the same period last year. The strong southlying growth is primarily attributed to core growth in our PBM book and Briova specialty pharmacy, as well as the year-over-year inclusion of the Cigna drug spend. Our gross profit increased 21% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. Fourth quarter gross profit was $364 million, a 12% increase over the same period last year. Gross profit margin for the year decreased from 7.6% to 6.3% due to the inclusion of the Cigna drug spend, which contributed significantly to our revenue, but carries a very low gross profit percentage relative to the overall book. Nonetheless, we continue to successfully drive margin expansion opportunities within our client portfolio through our Briova specialty pharmacy, clinical services, formula management tools, et cetera. SG&A expense for the full year was $518 million, and spending in the fourth quarter totaled $129 million, which was flat to the fourth quarter of 2013. As a percentage of sales, SG&A declined from 3% in 2013 to 2.4% in 2014, as we continue to drive leverage within the business and carefully manage our resources. As we built the scalable platform over the past several years, we'll continue to focus on leveraging spending going forward. For full year 2014, EBITDA increased 21% year-over-year to 778 -- $787 million. In the fourth quarter, we generated $222 million of EBITDA, a 22% increase over prior year. As a result of the strong earnings growth in working capital management, our ability to generate strong cash flow from operations continues to grow. We generated $590 million in operating cash flow during 2014, an increase of 24% over 2013, while at the same time, as many of our infrastructure investments behind us, we were able to reduce our capital expenditures in 2014 by 40% to $78 million, resulting in a significant lift in free cash and liquidity. As you can imagine, we are very pleased with the financial results the team delivered for full year 2014. Next, I'd like to spend a few minutes on recent M&A activity. In early January, we closed on the acquisition of Salveo and funded the $260 million purchase price with cash on hand. As you would expect from us, integration efforts are already well underway, and the Briova and Salveo teams are moving quickly to integrate the commercial efforts. The complementary nature of these 2 platforms is tremendous, and I would expect the majority of the commercial and technological integration efforts to be done by the end of the year. This morning, we announced our intention to acquire Healthcare Solutions. You've heard us talk about investing in assets that are both strategic and economic, and this opportunity clearly checks both boxes. The purchase price is $405 million before customary closing adjustments or approximately 11.6x EBITDA. We expect the transaction to close sometime in the second quarter and intend to also fund it through cash on hand. On an annualized basis, we would expect Healthcare Solution to contribute approximately $200 million in incremental revenue, which is net of the pharmacy revenue we already record today as their PBM service provider. We expect to generate approximately $10 million in annualized synergies once fully integrated, which we expect to take 12 to 18 months following the transaction's close. We also expect to incur $5 million to $10 million in one-time transaction and integration costs, primarily in the second and third quarters. Deploying capital through M&A remains a critical focus, and the Healthcare Solutions transaction is yet another example of our core investment philosophy. We will continue to actively manage the M&A pipeline. However, in the near term, we'll focus on closing the Healthcare Solutions transaction and integrating the 2 acquisitions as quickly as possible. Now shifting gears to 2015 expectations. We outlined in our initial guidance in our press release this morning, we expect to generate revenues of $23.5 billion to $24.5 billion for the full year. We expect to deliver EBITDA of $905 million to $930 million, GAAP earnings per share of $1.77 to $1.92 and adjusted EPS of $2.45 to $2.60. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS only excludes the after-tax effect of deal-related amortization, which is expected to be $205 million to $210 million in 2015. We also expect to have approximately 209 million fully diluted shares outstanding for 2015. These expectations are consistent with the preliminary thoughts I shared with you on the third quarter call, and incorporate all the various underlying growth drivers of the business as well as the impact of Salveo. And consistent with prior years, we expect the first quarter to bear the impact of our clients who offer high-deductible plans, as their members pay pharmacy directly, therefore, revenue and earnings should ramp throughout the year, as you would expect. It's important to note that our 2015 guidance excludes the impact of Healthcare Solutions as well as the related transaction costs. At this time, we're uncertain as to when the transaction will close. Naturally, we will incorporate the impact once we close on the transaction. A few other specifics to help you think about 2015. We expect interest expense to be in the range of $60 million to $65 million, depreciation in the range of $65 million to $70 million and noncontrolling interest in the range of $50 million to $55 million. We expect our tax rate to increase to 30% to 32% for the full year, which is more consistent with our historical averages. Finally, we expect to generate more than $600 million in cash flow from operations and expect CapEx to be relatively flat to 2014. So reflecting on our guidance, we expect to deliver revenue growth of 9% to 14% and EBITDA growth of 15% to 18%, and again, that excludes any impact from Healthcare Solutions, which we'll incorporate once the transaction closes. So with that, operator, we would welcome any questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC, Research Division Mark, good job on the M&A front this year, obviously, with the specialty acquisition today, the acquisition in workers' comp. But as we look down to this year, 2 questions for you. What is the -- how much bandwidth do you guys have to bring in more deals? And then what kind of pace can you take on more deals? And then second, what does the pipeline look like in terms of the larger deals in the PBM space? Mark A. Thierer Brian, thanks for the question. Relative to the 2 deals that we've gotten done here recently, Salveo and Healthcare Solutions, they're really nice adds to the footprint and both strategic and very economic for us as well, so we're feeling good about it. In terms of bandwidth, one of the virtues of our model is that when we acquire clients who are on our platform, we effectively incur no transition grinding. We don't have to move any of the IT technology because all the claims that are being processed at Healthcare Solutions run on our footprint. And so in many ways, it's easier to make these acquisitions than it is to win a new client and put them through an implementation process. So from a bandwidth standpoint, we're in a good place. We've completed a lot of heavy lifting on infrastructure work and migrations this last year. This integration work on Healthcare Solutions will be mostly administrative. And so from a bandwidth standpoint, we look pretty good. And I'll let Mike talk a little bit about targets and our thoughts around time frame. Michael H. Shapiro Sure, Brian. Obviously, we continue to actively manage the pipeline. As we've talked, we're very thoughtful and we think about both assets in PBM space, as well as complementary specialty properties, as well as opportunities in the HCIT space. Again, as Mark said, we're very thoughtful around driving out the integration efforts. And in my prepared remarks, as I mentioned, we're going to be very thoughtful around ensuring that we're making traction on the integration, but we'll continue to actively manage the pipeline, as you would expect us to do. But in the near term, we're going to focus on integration efforts. Brian Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC, Research Division Got it. And then the second question from me, Mark, last quarter, you talked about some of the early bids that you were able to put out there for 2016. So we heard some updates from the client's side on some of those contracts, but I just wanted to hear an update from you on what's going on in the contracting world for 2016 business. Mark A. Thierer Sure, Brian. Well, we're sitting here, it's February and so it's early in the selling season. I would say that our pipeline looks very good. As we mentioned in some of the prepared remarks, we're looking at business, obviously, for 1/1/16, and the bulk of that is employer business. I would say that the larger health plan business is actually midyear '17 and some 1/1/17 in terms of things we're already actively working on. So we're feeling good about the pipeline. The number of RFPs year-over-year, I would say, are pretty consistent. And the activity level has been high the last several years, and I would categorize this year as very similar to what we've seen in the last couple of years. Operator Our next question comes from Glen Santangelo with Crédit Suisse. And hearing no response from that line, we will move on to Steven Valiquette with UBS. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division So I guess for me, I'm just curious to get a little more color on the topic of branded drug rebates. I guess with more expensive specialty drugs entering the mix, I'm just curious if there's been any, I'll say, notable change over the past year or so in the percent of rebates retained by Catamaran or the PBM industry versus percent passed onto the customers? Michael H. Shapiro Thanks, Steven. It's Mike. As we think about rebates, our goal is to obviously manage the overall drug trend for our clients. As we've talked about in the past, the far majority of the rebates that are earned on the transactions we process are passed along to our clients. And I think the relative share of what's retained versus passed along, again, which is -- the far majority has been very consistent. Mark A. Thierer I would just add to that, Steven, to say there have been a few new breakthrough therapies, especially in the hep C class. There are some serious rebate dollars attached to this. And as you would fully expect, sophisticated buyers are active on both managing the class to try and contain utilization and enjoying some of the economics that come through from the rebates, and that's our job. We do, on behalf of our payers, negotiate these contracts and make it a cost-containment strategy. We pass those rebates along. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Yes, that's kind of what I was getting at. With the more expensive drugs, is there any percent change? But it sounds like not too much, but -- all right, great. Operator And we'll go back to Glen Santangelo with Crédit Suisse. Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division Mark, I just wanted to follow up. Last year, you talked a lot about the Catamaran Difference. And now that the company has kind of done 2 acquisitions here in the last kind of couple of months, it seems like that may put a little bit of an incremental stress on your customer service infrastructure. So could you maybe give us an update with where you stand with respect to that program? Is that kind of in the rearview mirror now? And do you feel like you have additional sort of bandwidth capacity from a customer service perspective at this point? Mark A. Thierer Yes, Glen, I appreciate the question. And just as a reminder to everyone, we did talk about investing $25 million last year and building out a service delivery model around 5 core work streams. It was really a major year of plumbing improvements for us here inside the company. It was our biggest management focus all year. And we did effectively complete that work by year end and felt very good about it. The -- I think the proof's in the pudding, and the way you score this is you actually grade your new live implementations. We started over 2 million lives at 1/1 this year, and as I mentioned in my remarks, I made phone calls to the bulk of our large clients. We also take actual scores on implementation satisfaction, and our early read is the 94% client satisfaction on our implementation. So the way we got there was extensive testing. We brought across a bunch of Part D lives where we had little or no CMS reportable events. And so the long story short here is, our investments in infrastructure, and we called it the Catamaran Difference, are paying us huge dividends. That is a direct answer to your question about bandwidth. That's why we did this work, to make this platform scalable and to be able to take on large blocks of new business. And so the fact of the matter is, our bandwidth and our ability to grow has been strengthened substantially by our work this last year on the Catamaran Difference. Michael H. Shapiro And Glen, one thing I would add is, as we think about both Salveo and Healthcare Solutions, both organizations have tremendous go-to-market and client-service organizations. And our intention is to maintain those organizations and build complementary service offerings. So we don't really see those as unnecessarily a stress on our systems. Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division Okay. Maybe, Mike, if I could just follow up with you, one question. You talked, obviously, about the loss of an HCIT client, which I think everyone is kind of well aware who that is. But you also talked about the loss of a PBM client in the Midwest. Do you all care to share or confirm who that may be? And are these both contracts that will go away as of 1/1/16? And is there any sort of preliminary comments about the potential EBITDA impact so we can think about that from a modeling perspective? Michael H. Shapiro Sure, Glen. We're not really inclined to talk about specific names of client wins and exits, as you've come to expect from us. Way too early to project what the impact on 2016 is. Naturally, as we get further along in the sell season, we'll be able to talk about the net impact of the book going into 2016, but still a little too early. Operator Moving on, we'll hear from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Mark, just going back to some of your comments on the selling season and that you expect RFP to actively be roughly the same. Is there a way for you to break down as far as your expectation? Do you see more opportunities to go after some of the larger employers? And what are you thinking in the area where you historically have been very strong in kind of the middle-market area? Any changes there? We've seen some recent acquisitions by a retailer in that space. So I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on the market dynamics right now. Mark A. Thierer Sure, Lisa. I would categorize this year's selling season, as I said, as robust. The volume is up in our RFP shop. Our bids and proposals area is very busy. From a strategy standpoint, the fact is we've scaled this business, and I think we're basically being asked to every dance, so we're getting a look at every opportunity in the market. I mean, when you think about the top 3 players who are out there, we are on the bid list. And so we're being discerning about what we run after and what we chase. And you're right, we've been very strong traditionally in the middle market. We're picking and choosing our spots in the larger employer space. We're not actually chasing every single one, but we are very competitive moving up market into larger employers. And I would say that it's these fragmented markets where we're seeing a lot of activity that we really like a lot. We like to organize these messier markets. They're higher gross margin contributors for us, and candidly, there's less competition in those segments. So yes, I mean, we do like the middle market, to your point. That's a higher gross margin contributor for us as a business, and we've been beefing that area up both from a sales and a consulting coverage standpoint. So that's an area we continue to focus on pretty aggressively. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division And then my second question is just really around capital deployment. I mean, you've done a good job of making acquisitions over the last few years, but in all honesty, the stock really hasn't done much. How do you think about share repurchase? Do you think that this is a good opportunity to use some of the cash flow you have to buy back some of your own stock? Or are you still focused, from a capital deployment perspective, on making incremental acquisitions? Michael H. Shapiro It's a great question, Lisa. Obviously, we're thrilled with the increasability for us to generate cash out of the business. And with earnings growth, that naturally is going to provide us with the comfort to maintain higher levels of leverage. So access to capital has naturally increased over the last couple of years. So to this point, investing in M&A has clearly presented us with the optimal way to deploy capital for shareholders with superior returns. And while we continue to believe that M&A is going to represent an attractive proposition going forward, we wouldn't rule out share repurchase as a complementary avenue to deploy capital, not in place of M&A, going forward. That's something, obviously, we continue to monitor and evaluate. Every transaction is evaluated against our weighted average cost of capital, and to the extent that we're -- that we think we have additional access to capital, we'll definitely explore share repurchase going forward. Operator Next, we'll hear from Brooks O'Neil with Dougherty & Company. Brooks G. O'Neil - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division I have one big-picture question and one minute detailed question. So on the big picture, Mark, I'm hoping you might be willing to talk a little bit about shifting dynamics competitively in the marketplace. Obviously, PBM/retail/pharmacy combinations appear to be on the increase. You got PBM/insurer combinations out. You got PBM/specialty player combinations out there. What are you finding, as you talk to clients and prospects, about your positioning relative to the way some of the others are? Mark A. Thierer Yes, Brooks, that is a good question. And having spent, I don't know, 30 years in this business in one form or fashion, it's been very interesting to see it evolve. And one thing that you can say about the PBM industry is that it is a business that, as an industry, has successfully morphed and recapped itself multiple times over the last 10 or 15 years. And I would say the dynamics today are maybe more interesting than ever. When you talk about these blended models, whether it's a PBM/retail blended model, a PBM embedded inside a large health plan, a stand-alone PBM offering, just claim services or perhaps a blended specialty model, the fact is these are all growing businesses, and they are resonating in the market. You have to say that the asset itself, the PBM assets, got real value. And I would suggest that it's really who's buying the service, who's buying the product. Is it an employer? Is it a health plan? Is it another payer or aggregator of lives in the market? It kind of depends on who's making the decision. And some of these models resonate for certain clients better than others. So that's the fact of the matter. I would say, though, my biggest takeaway, having been a participant for years, is the value creation that PBMs deliver is -- it's coveted in the sense that we've continued to lower the cost of pharmaceuticals every year since I've been in the business. So you can't point to many service delivery models that continue to save people money and deliver value. And I would say, overall, nothing has changed on that front, Brooks. Brooks G. O'Neil - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division That's great. And I mean, from my perspective, you continue to focus in the specialty area on the highest-cost, most-important patients, and that's got to add value to the clients as well. So on the minute question, Mike, I'm just curious, you had a 25.6% tax rate in Q4. You're guiding to 30% to 32% for 2015. Can you just help us to think about the factors that are going to drive that tax rate so much higher this year? Michael H. Shapiro You bet, Brooks. Our tax rate is, obviously, a combination of a number of factors, a mix of geographies of where we're generating income, as well as the outcome of certain tax matters and how they're resolved. So not to go into a bunch of details, but in 2014, the mix of different jurisdictions definitely fell our way as, quite frankly, a number of tax matters that were resolved in the year that fell on our side of the fence. So that helped with the rate. As you saw in 2014, we did come in under our initial guidance on the rates. But frankly speaking, looking at '15, a lot of those matters behind us, as well as where we think we're going to be generating the profits, I think 30% to 32% is a much more realistic expectation. And frankly, it's a lot closer to where we've historically landed as well. Operator Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America. Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Mark or Mike, did you actually break out the contribution from the 2 lost health plans? What -- how much you have to replace in '16? Michael H. Shapiro No, we haven't. Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Are we thinking about that? Michael H. Shapiro No, Bob. As you know, we're not as inclined to talk about the economics of specific clients. And again, we'll talk about the overall net book going into '16 as we get further along in the sell season. Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division All right. And when you won the Cigna relationship, you did break out a revenue run rate for that contract. Is there any appreciable change in that run rate? Has Cigna grown meaningfully or fallen short of your expectations from a volume perspective? Michael H. Shapiro It's generally in line. And as you pointed out, given the magnitude of that drug spend on our overall book, that's why we felt, at the time, inclined to provide a way to think about it. But overall, the drug trend and the impact is generally in line with what we were expecting. Operator We'll now hear from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Mark, in your prepared remarks, you kind of pointed to your pricing discipline. I was wondering if you could comment in general in terms of what you're seeing, whether there's any particular change in pricing taking on by some of your competitors. And if so, is it more along the lines of the guarantees being provided or in terms of a more aggressive stance on pricing spreads? Mark A. Thierer Yes, Michael, I appreciate the question. The -- my view on pricing, and we, every Friday, have our underwriting call on everything above a certain threshold. I would say that pricing is pretty disciplined and we remain very disciplined. It's a big market out there and there are a lot of players, and there are some very large players. And so what I can tell you is that, from my chair, aside from the 2 clients that we made mention of in our prepared remarks, we're keeping the large majority of our clients. Retention is going to be very, very strong. And so I don't think there's anything particularly irrational going on out there from a pricing standpoint. Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division And then, Mark, my second question is, as one of your competitors is starting to talk more openly about potentially taking risk in the oncology spend space, obviously, it's very broad and we don't have a lot of detail at this point, but I was wondering, in general, what your stance would be on that type of move. Mark A. Thierer Yes. I think that you're going to see a transition in the coming years in certain therapeutic classes, where taking risk is going to make more sense. And at some level, our recent hep C outcomes-based model is exactly that, taking risk at the client level. And in that case, we are partnered with the innovator through the contracting process to make it happen. Oncology sets up pretty well for the opportunity to take risks, and there are some players in the market that are not really PBMs that have figured out how to do this. So I do see a blending of those capabilities. You really have to be touching the doctor. You have to be touching the guys writing these prescriptions and infusing these medications in order to do it. But I do think, over time, you're going to see more of it, Michael. Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division And then, sorry, just a follow-up to that one. Can you talk a little bit about, in that context, population health management, whether or not that would be an important dynamic, particularly as it relates to winning and retaining self-funded employers? Mark A. Thierer I think population health management is going to be an important initiative going forward. If you were to come in to our innovation center here in Chicago, where we modeled the PBM of the year 2020, you'd see an important section, an entire area cordoned off and dedicated to population health management. So it's definitely a trend for the future. In terms of decisions being made today based on population health management capabilities, I think it's a little early. It's the early innings. But I do think, over time, it's an area where we see strategic investment opportunity and continued growth for sure. Operator Next, we'll go to Eric Percher with Barclays. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division Back to your comment on who's buying really impacts the value that's provided. Could you speak to, as you look out to the 2006 (sic) [2016] selling season, any changes that you've seen in benefit design or requests? And I'm thinking specifically, we've seen health plans willing to embrace exclusions on hep C, and traditionally, we haven't seen a lot of the folks you've serviced looking at exclusions as an option. So I'd love to hear a little bit about how that has evolved and whether it's applicable outside of hep C. Mark A. Thierer Yes, Eric. It's -- this has been an interesting trend. And I would say in the last, call it 2 years, payers, and I'll say broadly payers, payers' appetite for taking on restrictions, whether that's a restricted provider network, a restricted pharmacy network, whether that's restrictions in the formulary, just the notion of narrowing the benefit has really gotten traction broadly across the continuum. Now the fact of the matter is 70% of our revenue comes from health plans, all of whom are employing restricted networks of one sort or another, restricted formularies of one sort or another. The bulk of our health plans have actually retained the ability to manage formulary. That's something you see out there. And so what I'm seeing in the selling season is now you are seeing more employers, self-funded employers, willing to step up and sign on to both restricted networks and restricted benefit designs driving formulary. We have an exclusive formulary that we're bidding regularly now in the RFP season, and I think you'll see in 1/1/16 going forward, I think you'll see more adoption of those restricted offerings for sure. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division So you've seen it for the employer, as you said, your health plans make up the bulk. Has there been a willingness to mirror what you've done in hep C within those plans? Are you seeing more openness within those plans? Mark A. Thierer Oh, yes. Every major health plan, every single one, is moving toward restrictions of one sort or another really in most all of their product lines. The only place you don't see as much restricted activity is in the Managed Medicaid space, and you're actually starting to see some of it there. So yes, they are all adopting restricted strategies across their product lines. Operator And next, we'll hear from Garen Sarafian with Citigroup. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division First, just to make sure I understood correctly, on the retention rate, you weren't prepared to provide the total retention rate, but excluding the 2 clients, it was similar to last year's 97%, 98% then, is that correct? Michael H. Shapiro Yes, Garen, if you exclude those, given the visibility that we have for the amount of our book that's up and the efforts to renew, we would definitely be targeting the 97% to 98%, excluding those clients. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Got it. Okay. And then I guess the broader question I had was on specialty and scale. You've built up your Briova specialty business, that's now an impressive $2 billion run rate, which is very large, but still smaller -- much smaller than some of your largest peers. So is the $2 billion run rate enough of a critical mass, so to speak, to compete? Or you've got all the resources in the pharma manufacturers support that you need to compete? Or is there something that you're still prioritizing in the next near term, let's say, through M&A? Mark A. Thierer Yes, Garen, it's Mark. I think I'll start from a strategy standpoint, and then maybe let Mike talk a little bit about scale and muscle in the space. We've been prioritizing strategy for the last several years, and we exited the year on a $2 billion run rate for 2015. We're targeting well north of $3 billion for a run rate to exit this calendar year in all of specialty, and that is a scaled business. When you take a look at our Jeffersonville facility that's opened and servicing patients, and then you take a look at what we're building in our new Las Vegas facility, which is a mirror facility, anybody who's in the specialty business who goes to these facilities will tell you that they're among the best, if not the best, facilities in all of specialty. And we've taken this high-touch service model and effectively created 2 mirrored facilities that can compete with anybody in this business. And so you need economics, you need buy side leverage, but mostly, you need a service delivery model that's customized at the patient level. We're using innovation to differentiate ourselves in these markets. And so if you take a look at our Briova live offering, you would find that it's first-mover. We have these live interactions with registered pharmacists, MS pharmacists, rheumatoid arthritis pharmacists, specific -- therapy-specific pharmacists talking to members through a live Briova chat exchange. We just announced something called Briova Community, where if you're afflicted with hepatitis C, you can actually talk with people who share the condition, and you can talk to providers, you can access Briova Community and really learn about your condition, learn about the importance of medication adherence and ask questions in the privacy of your own home and online. So both of these technology answers are things we're winning with in the market. And so the fact of the matter is, there isn't a specialty opportunity, I don't think, out there that we can't compete for aggressively, and that's our strategy. Michael H. Shapiro And Garen, it's Mike. So just a couple of things that I would add. As Mark mentioned, we doubled the business in 2014 to over $2 billion. With Salveo and our multifaceted growth, we expect to exceed $3 billion in 2015. Again, that's through selling in the open market as well as further penetrating our PBM book. So as you can see, we're expecting to continue to outpace the overall market with our disciplined growth strategy. As we think about scale, today, we have the ability to fulfill more than 98% of all specialty scripts. So we have amongst the broadest distribution capabilities in the industry. And one thing that also affords us is the ability to sit at the table with somebody like Gilead to collaborate on coming up with new innovative pricing models. And we worked, as Mark mentioned in the prepared remarks, about our firsts. We are proud to collaborate with a critical manufacturing partner to come up with yet another first in specialty. Mark A. Thierer And just to extend that for a moment, you can tell that specialty is pretty central here. We're active in dialogue with the innovator companies in the PCSK9 area right now, talking about similar things that you've seen happen in the hep C category. And this new set of cholesterol inhibitors, this could be another breakthrough therapeutic class that we're giving a lot of thought to and talking to our clients actively. We've implemented something new called prospective P&T deliberation. We're already taking models to our clients, talking about what could this therapeutic class mean, how might you be able to deal with it, what does the pricing profile look like, what are your choices early on to get your arms around the potential of this, summertime, when these new agents hit the market, what are we going to do. So we see a lot of running room in the specialty in 2015. Operator And next, we'll hear from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Stephan Stewart - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division It's Stephan calling in for Bob. Just wanted to get back to the formulary management topic. Generic inflation has obviously been a big focus this year. Have you gotten a lot of pushback from clients at all on that trend? And is there anything clients are looking for the PBMs to do to manage that type of inflation, like paid formularies and generics or anything else? Michael H. Shapiro Yes, Stephan, it's Mike. We talked a little bit in the past about generic inflation. Candidly speaking, there were a couple of headlines around some pockets of generic inflation on a handful of NDCs. It's nothing that we see pervasive across the broad generic category. And admittedly, a lot of times, it's more short term in nature as it relates to supply disruption. So again, overall, driving utilization to generics is one of the core strategy that we employ to keep our clients and our payer's trends down. So that's something we continue to actively manage. Stephan Stewart - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division And just one housekeeping question on the acquisition. I think you said $200 million of incremental revenue and $35 million in EBITDA. Can we get a sense of what the incremental claim volume would be or revenue per claim? And just wanted to confirm that incremental margin is in the 20% range, around there. Michael H. Shapiro Yes. Again, we're not in a position to provide per-claim data or total claims. Again, it's a little bit of a different market, given the fact that their operations are really on providing comprehensive workers' comp solutions. What I can tell you is, just to reiterate, they generate roughly $400 million in revenue, $35 million in EBITDA, so a very respectable margin profile. Again, from an incremental impact on our books, because we were already serving as their PBM, we had recorded roughly $200 million of drug spend revenue on our books. So the incremental impact on an annualized basis is around $200 million top line, around $35 million in EBITDA, again, before synergies. Operator And that's all the time we have for questions. I'll turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Mark A. Thierer Well, thank you, operator, and thank you, all, for following the Catamaran story. We'll talk to you next quarter. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Brian Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC, Research Division Mark, good job on the M&A front this year, obviously, with the specialty acquisition today, the acquisition in workers' comp. But as we look down to this year, 2 questions for you. What is the -- how much bandwidth do you guys have to bring in more deals? And then what kind of pace can you take on more deals? And then second, what does the pipeline look like in terms of the larger deals in the PBM space? Mark A. Thierer Brian, thanks for the question. Relative to the 2 deals that we've gotten done here recently, Salveo and Healthcare Solutions, they're really nice adds to the footprint and both strategic and very economic for us as well, so we're feeling good about it. In terms of bandwidth, one of the virtues of our model is that when we acquire clients who are on our platform, we effectively incur no transition grinding. We don't have to move any of the IT technology because all the claims that are being processed at Healthcare Solutions run on our footprint. And so in many ways, it's easier to make these acquisitions than it is to win a new client and put them through an implementation process. So from a bandwidth standpoint, we're in a good place. We've completed a lot of heavy lifting on infrastructure work and migrations this last year. This integration work on Healthcare Solutions will be mostly administrative. And so from a bandwidth standpoint, we look pretty good. And I'll let Mike talk a little bit about targets and our thoughts around time frame. Michael H. Shapiro Sure, Brian. Obviously, we continue to actively manage the pipeline. As we've talked, we're very thoughtful and we think about both assets in PBM space, as well as complementary specialty properties, as well as opportunities in the HCIT space. Again, as Mark said, we're very thoughtful around driving out the integration efforts. And in my prepared remarks, as I mentioned, we're going to be very thoughtful around ensuring that we're making traction on the integration, but we'll continue to actively manage the pipeline, as you would expect us to do. But in the near term, we're going to focus on integration efforts. Brian Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC, Research Division Got it. And then the second question from me, Mark, last quarter, you talked about some of the early bids that you were able to put out there for 2016. So we heard some updates from the client's side on some of those contracts, but I just wanted to hear an update from you on what's going on in the contracting world for 2016 business. Mark A. Thierer Sure, Brian. Well, we're sitting here, it's February and so it's early in the selling season. I would say that our pipeline looks very good. As we mentioned in some of the prepared remarks, we're looking at business, obviously, for 1/1/16, and the bulk of that is employer business. I would say that the larger health plan business is actually midyear '17 and some 1/1/17 in terms of things we're already actively working on. So we're feeling good about the pipeline. The number of RFPs year-over-year, I would say, are pretty consistent. And the activity level has been high the last several years, and I would categorize this year as very similar to what we've seen in the last couple of years. Operator Our next question comes from Glen Santangelo with Crédit Suisse. And hearing no response from that line, we will move on to Steven Valiquette with UBS. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division So I guess for me, I'm just curious to get a little more color on the topic of branded drug rebates. I guess with more expensive specialty drugs entering the mix, I'm just curious if there's been any, I'll say, notable change over the past year or so in the percent of rebates retained by Catamaran or the PBM industry versus percent passed onto the customers? Michael H. Shapiro Thanks, Steven. It's Mike. As we think about rebates, our goal is to obviously manage the overall drug trend for our clients. As we've talked about in the past, the far majority of the rebates that are earned on the transactions we process are passed along to our clients. And I think the relative share of what's retained versus passed along, again, which is -- the far majority has been very consistent. Mark A. Thierer I would just add to that, Steven, to say there have been a few new breakthrough therapies, especially in the hep C class. There are some serious rebate dollars attached to this. And as you would fully expect, sophisticated buyers are active on both managing the class to try and contain utilization and enjoying some of the economics that come through from the rebates, and that's our job. We do, on behalf of our payers, negotiate these contracts and make it a cost-containment strategy. We pass those rebates along. Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Yes, that's kind of what I was getting at. With the more expensive drugs, is there any percent change? But it sounds like not too much, but -- all right, great. Operator And we'll go back to Glen Santangelo with Crédit Suisse. Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division Mark, I just wanted to follow up. Last year, you talked a lot about the Catamaran Difference. And now that the company has kind of done 2 acquisitions here in the last kind of couple of months, it seems like that may put a little bit of an incremental stress on your customer service infrastructure. So could you maybe give us an update with where you stand with respect to that program? Is that kind of in the rearview mirror now? And do you feel like you have additional sort of bandwidth capacity from a customer service perspective at this point? Mark A. Thierer Yes, Glen, I appreciate the question. And just as a reminder to everyone, we did talk about investing $25 million last year and building out a service delivery model around 5 core work streams. It was really a major year of plumbing improvements for us here inside the company. It was our biggest management focus all year. And we did effectively complete that work by year end and felt very good about it. The -- I think the proof's in the pudding, and the way you score this is you actually grade your new live implementations. We started over 2 million lives at 1/1 this year, and as I mentioned in my remarks, I made phone calls to the bulk of our large clients. We also take actual scores on implementation satisfaction, and our early read is the 94% client satisfaction on our implementation. So the way we got there was extensive testing. We brought across a bunch of Part D lives where we had little or no CMS reportable events. And so the long story short here is, our investments in infrastructure, and we called it the Catamaran Difference, are paying us huge dividends. That is a direct answer to your question about bandwidth. That's why we did this work, to make this platform scalable and to be able to take on large blocks of new business. And so the fact of the matter is, our bandwidth and our ability to grow has been strengthened substantially by our work this last year on the Catamaran Difference. Michael H. Shapiro And Glen, one thing I would add is, as we think about both Salveo and Healthcare Solutions, both organizations have tremendous go-to-market and client-service organizations. And our intention is to maintain those organizations and build complementary service offerings. So we don't really see those as unnecessarily a stress on our systems. Glen J. Santangelo - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division Okay. Maybe, Mike, if I could just follow up with you, one question. You talked, obviously, about the loss of an HCIT client, which I think everyone is kind of well aware who that is. But you also talked about the loss of a PBM client in the Midwest. Do you all care to share or confirm who that may be? And are these both contracts that will go away as of 1/1/16? And is there any sort of preliminary comments about the potential EBITDA impact so we can think about that from a modeling perspective? Michael H. Shapiro Sure, Glen. We're not really inclined to talk about specific names of client wins and exits, as you've come to expect from us. Way too early to project what the impact on 2016 is. Naturally, as we get further along in the sell season, we'll be able to talk about the net impact of the book going into 2016, but still a little too early. Operator Moving on, we'll hear from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Mark, just going back to some of your comments on the selling season and that you expect RFP to actively be roughly the same. Is there a way for you to break down as far as your expectation? Do you see more opportunities to go after some of the larger employers? And what are you thinking in the area where you historically have been very strong in kind of the middle-market area? Any changes there? We've seen some recent acquisitions by a retailer in that space. So I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on the market dynamics right now. Mark A. Thierer Sure, Lisa. I would categorize this year's selling season, as I said, as robust. The volume is up in our RFP shop. Our bids and proposals area is very busy. From a strategy standpoint, the fact is we've scaled this business, and I think we're basically being asked to every dance, so we're getting a look at every opportunity in the market. I mean, when you think about the top 3 players who are out there, we are on the bid list. And so we're being discerning about what we run after and what we chase. And you're right, we've been very strong traditionally in the middle market. We're picking and choosing our spots in the larger employer space. We're not actually chasing every single one, but we are very competitive moving up market into larger employers. And I would say that it's these fragmented markets where we're seeing a lot of activity that we really like a lot. We like to organize these messier markets. They're higher gross margin contributors for us, and candidly, there's less competition in those segments. So yes, I mean, we do like the middle market, to your point. That's a higher gross margin contributor for us as a business, and we've been beefing that area up both from a sales and a consulting coverage standpoint. So that's an area we continue to focus on pretty aggressively. Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division And then my second question is just really around capital deployment. I mean, you've done a good job of making acquisitions over the last few years, but in all honesty, the stock really hasn't done much. How do you think about share repurchase? Do you think that this is a good opportunity to use some of the cash flow you have to buy back some of your own stock? Or are you still focused, from a capital deployment perspective, on making incremental acquisitions? Michael H. Shapiro It's a great question, Lisa. Obviously, we're thrilled with the increasability for us to generate cash out of the business. And with earnings growth, that naturally is going to provide us with the comfort to maintain higher levels of leverage. So access to capital has naturally increased over the last couple of years. So to this point, investing in M&A has clearly presented us with the optimal way to deploy capital for shareholders with superior returns. And while we continue to believe that M&A is going to represent an attractive proposition going forward, we wouldn't rule out share repurchase as a complementary avenue to deploy capital, not in place of M&A, going forward. That's something, obviously, we continue to monitor and evaluate. Every transaction is evaluated against our weighted average cost of capital, and to the extent that we're -- that we think we have additional access to capital, we'll definitely explore share repurchase going forward. Operator Next, we'll hear from Brooks O'Neil with Dougherty & Company. Brooks G. O'Neil - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division I have one big-picture question and one minute detailed question. So on the big picture, Mark, I'm hoping you might be willing to talk a little bit about shifting dynamics competitively in the marketplace. Obviously, PBM/retail/pharmacy combinations appear to be on the increase. You got PBM/insurer combinations out. You got PBM/specialty player combinations out there. What are you finding, as you talk to clients and prospects, about your positioning relative to the way some of the others are? Mark A. Thierer Yes, Brooks, that is a good question. And having spent, I don't know, 30 years in this business in one form or fashion, it's been very interesting to see it evolve. And one thing that you can say about the PBM industry is that it is a business that, as an industry, has successfully morphed and recapped itself multiple times over the last 10 or 15 years. And I would say the dynamics today are maybe more interesting than ever. When you talk about these blended models, whether it's a PBM/retail blended model, a PBM embedded inside a large health plan, a stand-alone PBM offering, just claim services or perhaps a blended specialty model, the fact is these are all growing businesses, and they are resonating in the market. You have to say that the asset itself, the PBM assets, got real value. And I would suggest that it's really who's buying the service, who's buying the product. Is it an employer? Is it a health plan? Is it another payer or aggregator of lives in the market? It kind of depends on who's making the decision. And some of these models resonate for certain clients better than others. So that's the fact of the matter. I would say, though, my biggest takeaway, having been a participant for years, is the value creation that PBMs deliver is -- it's coveted in the sense that we've continued to lower the cost of pharmaceuticals every year since I've been in the business. So you can't point to many service delivery models that continue to save people money and deliver value. And I would say, overall, nothing has changed on that front, Brooks. Brooks G. O'Neil - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division That's great. And I mean, from my perspective, you continue to focus in the specialty area on the highest-cost, most-important patients, and that's got to add value to the clients as well. So on the minute question, Mike, I'm just curious, you had a 25.6% tax rate in Q4. You're guiding to 30% to 32% for 2015. Can you just help us to think about the factors that are going to drive that tax rate so much higher this year? Michael H. Shapiro You bet, Brooks. Our tax rate is, obviously, a combination of a number of factors, a mix of geographies of where we're generating income, as well as the outcome of certain tax matters and how they're resolved. So not to go into a bunch of details, but in 2014, the mix of different jurisdictions definitely fell our way as, quite frankly, a number of tax matters that were resolved in the year that fell on our side of the fence. So that helped with the rate. As you saw in 2014, we did come in under our initial guidance on the rates. But frankly speaking, looking at '15, a lot of those matters behind us, as well as where we think we're going to be generating the profits, I think 30% to 32% is a much more realistic expectation. And frankly, it's a lot closer to where we've historically landed as well. Operator Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America. Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Mark or Mike, did you actually break out the contribution from the 2 lost health plans? What -- how much you have to replace in '16? Michael H. Shapiro No, we haven't. Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Are we thinking about that? Michael H. Shapiro No, Bob. As you know, we're not as inclined to talk about the economics of specific clients. And again, we'll talk about the overall net book going into '16 as we get further along in the sell season. Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division All right. And when you won the Cigna relationship, you did break out a revenue run rate for that contract. Is there any appreciable change in that run rate? Has Cigna grown meaningfully or fallen short of your expectations from a volume perspective? Michael H. Shapiro It's generally in line. And as you pointed out, given the magnitude of that drug spend on our overall book, that's why we felt, at the time, inclined to provide a way to think about it. But overall, the drug trend and the impact is generally in line with what we were expecting. Operator We'll now hear from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Mark, in your prepared remarks, you kind of pointed to your pricing discipline. I was wondering if you could comment in general in terms of what you're seeing, whether there's any particular change in pricing taking on by some of your competitors. And if so, is it more along the lines of the guarantees being provided or in terms of a more aggressive stance on pricing spreads? Mark A. Thierer Yes, Michael, I appreciate the question. The -- my view on pricing, and we, every Friday, have our underwriting call on everything above a certain threshold. I would say that pricing is pretty disciplined and we remain very disciplined. It's a big market out there and there are a lot of players, and there are some very large players. And so what I can tell you is that, from my chair, aside from the 2 clients that we made mention of in our prepared remarks, we're keeping the large majority of our clients. Retention is going to be very, very strong. And so I don't think there's anything particularly irrational going on out there from a pricing standpoint. Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division And then, Mark, my second question is, as one of your competitors is starting to talk more openly about potentially taking risk in the oncology spend space, obviously, it's very broad and we don't have a lot of detail at this point, but I was wondering, in general, what your stance would be on that type of move. Mark A. Thierer Yes. I think that you're going to see a transition in the coming years in certain therapeutic classes, where taking risk is going to make more sense. And at some level, our recent hep C outcomes-based model is exactly that, taking risk at the client level. And in that case, we are partnered with the innovator through the contracting process to make it happen. Oncology sets up pretty well for the opportunity to take risks, and there are some players in the market that are not really PBMs that have figured out how to do this. So I do see a blending of those capabilities. You really have to be touching the doctor. You have to be touching the guys writing these prescriptions and infusing these medications in order to do it. But I do think, over time, you're going to see more of it, Michael. Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division And then, sorry, just a follow-up to that one. Can you talk a little bit about, in that context, population health management, whether or not that would be an important dynamic, particularly as it relates to winning and retaining self-funded employers? Mark A. Thierer I think population health management is going to be an important initiative going forward. If you were to come in to our innovation center here in Chicago, where we modeled the PBM of the year 2020, you'd see an important section, an entire area cordoned off and dedicated to population health management. So it's definitely a trend for the future. In terms of decisions being made today based on population health management capabilities, I think it's a little early. It's the early innings. But I do think, over time, it's an area where we see strategic investment opportunity and continued growth for sure. Operator Next, we'll go to Eric Percher with Barclays. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division Back to your comment on who's buying really impacts the value that's provided. Could you speak to, as you look out to the 2006 (sic) [2016] selling season, any changes that you've seen in benefit design or requests? And I'm thinking specifically, we've seen health plans willing to embrace exclusions on hep C, and traditionally, we haven't seen a lot of the folks you've serviced looking at exclusions as an option. So I'd love to hear a little bit about how that has evolved and whether it's applicable outside of hep C. Mark A. Thierer Yes, Eric. It's -- this has been an interesting trend. And I would say in the last, call it 2 years, payers, and I'll say broadly payers, payers' appetite for taking on restrictions, whether that's a restricted provider network, a restricted pharmacy network, whether that's restrictions in the formulary, just the notion of narrowing the benefit has really gotten traction broadly across the continuum. Now the fact of the matter is 70% of our revenue comes from health plans, all of whom are employing restricted networks of one sort or another, restricted formularies of one sort or another. The bulk of our health plans have actually retained the ability to manage formulary. That's something you see out there. And so what I'm seeing in the selling season is now you are seeing more employers, self-funded employers, willing to step up and sign on to both restricted networks and restricted benefit designs driving formulary. We have an exclusive formulary that we're bidding regularly now in the RFP season, and I think you'll see in 1/1/16 going forward, I think you'll see more adoption of those restricted offerings for sure. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division So you've seen it for the employer, as you said, your health plans make up the bulk. Has there been a willingness to mirror what you've done in hep C within those plans? Are you seeing more openness within those plans? Mark A. Thierer Oh, yes. Every major health plan, every single one, is moving toward restrictions of one sort or another really in most all of their product lines. The only place you don't see as much restricted activity is in the Managed Medicaid space, and you're actually starting to see some of it there. So yes, they are all adopting restricted strategies across their product lines. Operator And next, we'll hear from Garen Sarafian with Citigroup. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division First, just to make sure I understood correctly, on the retention rate, you weren't prepared to provide the total retention rate, but excluding the 2 clients, it was similar to last year's 97%, 98% then, is that correct? Michael H. Shapiro Yes, Garen, if you exclude those, given the visibility that we have for the amount of our book that's up and the efforts to renew, we would definitely be targeting the 97% to 98%, excluding those clients. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Got it. Okay. And then I guess the broader question I had was on specialty and scale. You've built up your Briova specialty business, that's now an impressive $2 billion run rate, which is very large, but still smaller -- much smaller than some of your largest peers. So is the $2 billion run rate enough of a critical mass, so to speak, to compete? Or you've got all the resources in the pharma manufacturers support that you need to compete? Or is there something that you're still prioritizing in the next near term, let's say, through M&A? Mark A. Thierer Yes, Garen, it's Mark. I think I'll start from a strategy standpoint, and then maybe let Mike talk a little bit about scale and muscle in the space. We've been prioritizing strategy for the last several years, and we exited the year on a $2 billion run rate for 2015. We're targeting well north of $3 billion for a run rate to exit this calendar year in all of specialty, and that is a scaled business. When you take a look at our Jeffersonville facility that's opened and servicing patients, and then you take a look at what we're building in our new Las Vegas facility, which is a mirror facility, anybody who's in the specialty business who goes to these facilities will tell you that they're among the best, if not the best, facilities in all of specialty. And we've taken this high-touch service model and effectively created 2 mirrored facilities that can compete with anybody in this business. And so you need economics, you need buy side leverage, but mostly, you need a service delivery model that's customized at the patient level. We're using innovation to differentiate ourselves in these markets. And so if you take a look at our Briova live offering, you would find that it's first-mover. We have these live interactions with registered pharmacists, MS pharmacists, rheumatoid arthritis pharmacists, specific -- therapy-specific pharmacists talking to members through a live Briova chat exchange. We just announced something called Briova Community, where if you're afflicted with hepatitis C, you can actually talk with people who share the condition, and you can talk to providers, you can access Briova Community and really learn about your condition, learn about the importance of medication adherence and ask questions in the privacy of your own home and online. So both of these technology answers are things we're winning with in the market. And so the fact of the matter is, there isn't a specialty opportunity, I don't think, out there that we can't compete for aggressively, and that's our strategy. Michael H. Shapiro And Garen, it's Mike. So just a couple of things that I would add. As Mark mentioned, we doubled the business in 2014 to over $2 billion. With Salveo and our multifaceted growth, we expect to exceed $3 billion in 2015. Again, that's through selling in the open market as well as further penetrating our PBM book. So as you can see, we're expecting to continue to outpace the overall market with our disciplined growth strategy. As we think about scale, today, we have the ability to fulfill more than 98% of all specialty scripts. So we have amongst the broadest distribution capabilities in the industry. And one thing that also affords us is the ability to sit at the table with somebody like Gilead to collaborate on coming up with new innovative pricing models. And we worked, as Mark mentioned in the prepared remarks, about our firsts. We are proud to collaborate with a critical manufacturing partner to come up with yet another first in specialty. Mark A. Thierer And just to extend that for a moment, you can tell that specialty is pretty central here. We're active in dialogue with the innovator companies in the PCSK9 area right now, talking about similar things that you've seen happen in the hep C category. And this new set of cholesterol inhibitors, this could be another breakthrough therapeutic class that we're giving a lot of thought to and talking to our clients actively. We've implemented something new called prospective P&T deliberation. We're already taking models to our clients, talking about what could this therapeutic class mean, how might you be able to deal with it, what does the pricing profile look like, what are your choices early on to get your arms around the potential of this, summertime, when these new agents hit the market, what are we going to do. So we see a lot of running room in the specialty in 2015. Operator And next, we'll hear from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Stephan Stewart - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division It's Stephan calling in for Bob. Just wanted to get back to the formulary management topic. Generic inflation has obviously been a big focus this year. Have you gotten a lot of pushback from clients at all on that trend? And is there anything clients are looking for the PBMs to do to manage that type of inflation, like paid formularies and generics or anything else? Michael H. Shapiro Yes, Stephan, it's Mike. We talked a little bit in the past about generic inflation. Candidly speaking, there were a couple of headlines around some pockets of generic inflation on a handful of NDCs. It's nothing that we see pervasive across the broad generic category. And admittedly, a lot of times, it's more short term in nature as it relates to supply disruption. So again, overall, driving utilization to generics is one of the core strategy that we employ to keep our clients and our payer's trends down. So that's something we continue to actively manage. Stephan Stewart - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division And just one housekeeping question on the acquisition. I think you said $200 million of incremental revenue and $35 million in EBITDA. Can we get a sense of what the incremental claim volume would be or revenue per claim? And just wanted to confirm that incremental margin is in the 20% range, around there. Michael H. Shapiro Yes. Again, we're not in a position to provide per-claim data or total claims. Again, it's a little bit of a different market, given the fact that their operations are really on providing comprehensive workers' comp solutions. What I can tell you is, just to reiterate, they generate roughly $400 million in revenue, $35 million in EBITDA, so a very respectable margin profile. Again, from an incremental impact on our books, because we were already serving as their PBM, we had recorded roughly $200 million of drug spend revenue on our books. So the incremental impact on an annualized basis is around $200 million top line, around $35 million in EBITDA, again, before synergies. Operator And that's all the time we have for questions. I'll turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Mark A. Thierer Well, thank you, operator, and thank you, all, for following the Catamaran story. We'll talk to you next quarter. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir. David Nelson - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter 2017 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are: Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Raj Mehta, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-Q filed later today. I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Cognizant is off to a solid start this year. Our first quarter revenue was $3.55 billion, at the top end of our guided range, and up 10.7% your rear. Our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.84. Turning to guidance, we expect second quarter revenue to be within a range of $3.63 billion to $3.68 billion, and we continue to expect full-year revenue growth in the range of 8% to 10%. I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing how we're accelerating our shift to digital by helping clients become technology enabled across their businesses. As the markets we serve move away from the physical and towards the digital, our clients know that they must build new customer experiences and automated processes on top of secure and scalable technology. That's the only way to compete effectively in a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence, algorithms, bots, and big data. Doing so at scale, however, is a tall order, and that's why Cognizant's mission is to help clients transform their business models, their operating models, and their technology models in tandem to deliver the promise of digital at scale. Now we realize the word digital carries many meanings. For Cognizant, it goes well beyond building user interfaces or implementing collaboration platforms. For us, it's about using technology to enable clients to run better and run different. It's about the dual mandate to achieve more efficient and effective operations while reshaping business models for innovation and growth. This is the digital that matters. As noted on the Q4 call, Cognizant's digital revenue is generated by all the work we do to help clients excel in this new economy. That work spans the development of more engaging customer experiences, automated core business processes, and modern secure technology systems. It's because we care about the success of our customers and can speed their movement from doing digital to being digital that we realigned our company last year into three practice areas. At the point where clients engage their customers, partners, and employees, we work with them to build compelling experiences across channels and devices to create new value, revenue, and growth. That's what Cognizant's digital business does. To make their operating models more efficient and agile, we help elevate their operational core with processes that apply automation, managed services, and systems of intelligence. That's the focus of Cognizant's digital operations. And for their core infrastructure and technology, we simplify and modernize their legacy IT systems and implement a flexible backbone to deliver auto-scaling infrastructure, real-time data management, and adaptive security. And that's the role of Cognizant Digital Systems and Technology. Our cohesive approach extends from personalized customer interactions all the way through the IT infrastructure. Our three practices work closely with our industry verticals, which is the way we go to market, as well as with our geography and Cognizant business consulting to create industry-tailored solutions. By aligning all of our offerings within these practice areas, we've been able to open up significant new growth opportunities. Our aim is for clients to become fully technology-enabled in every aspect of their businesses. But what does that entail, and how do clients benefit? Cognizant has been working with a multinational insurance and financial services firm to overcome its process, organizational, and technology challenges and speed its journey towards digital. Because the firm lacked uniform processes and relied heavily on manual intervention, its insurance policies were prone to errors, and new products could take up to two months to roll out. Few of its agents had adopted advanced technology, and therefore few could take a 360-degree view of their customers' needs. There were no end-to-end digital channels for selling and issuing policies, and rigid back-end systems couldn't keep up with their expanding roster of customers whose own needs were growing. By the way, this example of legacy IT constraining the business is one we often see amongst our clients. In a three-phase engagement, Cognizant digitized the firm's enterprise applications relating to the administration of general and life insurance policies, enabling straight-through processing. Then we helped the firm use its new enterprise foundation to build its own customized user interfaces. And now in the third phase, we're providing all their partner channels and entities with digitized customer interaction platforms that integrate the firm's data, processes, and services. As a result, this client's new product rollout cycle has been reduced by 35% to 50%. And with its new 360-degree view of customers, the firm can design products for diverse customer segments, upsell products, and enhance its overall product marketing. This is an example of how two of our practices, Digital Business and Digital Systems and Technology, come together to transform a client's business. On our last call, we expressed our commitment to accelerate our shift to digital services and solutions. Here are some signs of our continued strong momentum. Building on our acquisition of companies such as Idea Couture, Mirabeau, and Adaptra, we acquired Brilliant Service in Q1 to strengthen our digital capabilities in Japan. Brilliant Service provides end-to-end Android and iOS applications, embedded software, and user experience design to major corporations in Japan. We continued the momentum of our client innovation spaces, opening two more of these collaboratories, one in Amsterdam and another in Melbourne. And in Barcelona, we opened the Salesforce Solutions Focus Lab that combines a supply center and a delivery center. In addition, to ensure that our teams remain at the vanguard of mastering advanced technologies, we're stepping up investments in professional training. This year our goal is to develop more than 10,000 engineers and architects plus another 10,000 across niche areas of artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and cognitive computing. Given the tens of thousands of employees already skilled in these areas, we expect to have about 100,000 employees by the end of this year with a depth of knowledge and skills that will enable them to pursue the most specialized areas of digital. All of these initiatives are needed because as client interest in becoming technology-enabled across their businesses grow, we're engaging with an increasing number of larger, more complex digital-at-scale projects. Our progress is receiving broad validation from industry analysts. We remain a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for providers of managed workplace services. IDC named us a leader in IoT consulting and systems integration. Everest Group calls Cognizant a leader and star performer in digital services, and HfS Research placed us in the Winner's Circle for digital marketing operations. Overall, our digital-related revenues are growing well above company average. We continue to pursue tuck-in acquisitions to expand our intellectual capital, domain expertise, global reach, and our platform and technology capabilities. Of course, we maintain our focus on strategic clients across our core industries. Raj will provide a bit more color on how we're accelerating our shift. It's exciting to think about the scale of the opportunity ahead as technology embeds itself into almost everything, as tens of billions of devices join the Internet, and as the amount of digital information reaches an expected 35 trillion gigabytes by 2020. Cognizant's Center for the Future of Work studied 2,000 companies across six industries globally to determine what percent of their overall revenue is driven by digital transformation. In 2015 it was nearly 5%, but by 2018 we expect this technology to influence more than 11% of all revenues these companies generate, or more than $2 trillion. There's a virtuous cycle at work. The more clients invest in new technologies, the greater the return, and the more they want to invest. We see the pervasive build-out of advanced technologies significantly expanding our market opportunity. Now I'd like to cover two central elements of our plan, which are to improve margins and execute an enhanced shareholder capital return program. We moved quickly to implement our capital return program. In March we launched a $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program that is ongoing, and today we announced the company's first quarterly cash dividend. On the margin front, we have a number of operational efficiency and cost reduction work streams underway. In addition, our board has shifted management compensation to more closely reflect the balance we're striking between revenue and profit growth. The board and the company leaders, including me, are intensively focused on executing both these plan elements. Karen will provide more detail within her remarks. We also continue to refresh our board, and in March we announced the appointment of two new directors who will replace two retiring directors. I want to take this opportunity to welcome two independent directors who joined the Cognizant board on April 1, Betsy Atkins and John Dineen. Betsy is the CEO of venture capital firm Baja Corporation and an entrepreneur who has cofounded and led enterprise technology companies. John brings extensive leadership and operational experience from his 28 years in senior roles with GE, most recently as the CEO of GE Health Care. We look forward to benefiting from their expertise on our board. I'd also like to thank Tom Wendel and Lakshmi Narayanan, who will not be standing for reelection at our upcoming annual meeting, for their many years of service to the company. To wrap up, being digital is the defining challenge for today's C-suite and the enterprises they lead. Digital touches every part of every company strategy and operations, and therefore it touches every part of our business. We're committed to accelerating the shift to digital to create value for both our clients and our shareholders, and we're committed to executing our plan on margin improvement and capital allocation. And now over to Raj, who will discuss first quarter performance in greater detail, followed by Karen, who will cover our financial results. Raj? Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Thanks, Frank. Building on Frank's discussion, I'll outline our progress in executing the shift to digital. And then I'll review our industry verticals, focusing on our financial performance and how we're helping our clients manage through their challenges. To speed our progress, we have many initiatives underway. Here are the top three. First, we're expanding our solutions portfolio. To do so, we're deploying repeatable industry-tailored solutions faster across our three practice areas, and we're further developing offerings through selected partnerships and acquisitions. Second, we're deepening and broadening our digital skills under the guidance of chief digital officers in each of our industry and regional business units. Our CDOs oversee the building of domain-based solutions, and they ensure that our teams, which focus on our strategic clients, have the skills they need. As a result, our teams are broadening Cognizant's reach and deepening our relationships, particularly with decision-makers who are outside the clients' CIO organizations. Third, we're enhancing our digital engagement with clients. For example, at our Newark laboratory, co-innovation centers in Amsterdam and Melbourne, our strategists, designers, data scientists, human science, and cyber security experts work with clients and partners to design, prototype, build, and run new customer experience and business processes. During the first quarter, about 50 clients visited our innovation centers. Today in every industry, our clients face common challenges. They must strike a balance between optimizing cost and investing in innovation. We help them to do both at the same time on their journey to implement digital at scale. Through our engagement, clients are able to drive profitable growth by enhancing their customers' experience, speeding products to market, and deploying new business models. I want to turn now to our financial performance in our industry verticals and provide examples of our customer engagements. Let's start with Banking and Financial Services, which consists of our banking, capital markets, insurance, and transaction processing clients. First quarter revenues were up 7% year over year. Consider the work our Digital Systems and Technology practice is doing with ABN AMRO Clearing. We are cloud-enabling their global IT infrastructure and laying the foundation for digital transformation. Cognizant will modernize their existing global technology infrastructure and transform their IT operating model across their core trading system, reporting systems, and other business services. We'll also provide hybrid cloud security network management and end-user services. Doing so will enable ABN AMRO Clearing to increase their operational resilience and application availability. They'll able to operate with greater speed and agility to better manage market volatility, and they'll lower their capital investment and operating cost. This is what we mean by driving digital at scale. For insurance clients, our Digital Operations team is able to rationalize their life and annuity platforms, supporting policy issue, building collections and claims. With these integrated platforms, clients can manage their legacy products more efficiently while providing a foundation on which to build more customer-centric digital capabilities. Turning to healthcare, this segment consists of payer, provider, pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device clients. First quarter revenues were up 9.7% year over year. To help clients balance cost and investment, we're developing solutions that address cost, access, and quality of care. These solutions will improve membership engagement and combine clinical and claims data through advanced population healthcare management initiatives. Client interest in our healthcare platforms, including TriZetto, continues to grow. Take the work our Digital Operations practice is doing with LifeBridge Health, based in Maryland. We're working to transform communications across their network and drive stronger relationships among physicians, patients, and regional health facilities. LifeBridge's communication network is built on our cloud-based Onvida software-as-a-service platform. Our platform combines customizable software with 24x7 phone and online access to clinical specialists. As a result, patients have self-service access to consultations and information to manage their healthcare, and doctors can receive near real-time customized communication about their patients. This means better care coordination and better transition of care. To deal with the launch of new projects and rising pricing pressures on existing products, our life science clients know they must enhance their patient, provider, and payer engagements. In response, these clients are increasingly interested in patient engagement, clinical analytics, investigator collaboration, new commercial models, and customer service transformation. Here's a case in point. A large U.S.-based pharmaceutical and medical device company is using our MedVantage platform to transform their field services, quality, and complaints processes. Our cloud-based platform, which is part of digital operations, will help them drive higher levels of agility and productivity and improve customer experience. Turning to retail and manufacturing, this segment grew to 16.4% year over year. We've renamed this segment Products and Resources to more clearly convey the industries we serve here, retail and consumer goods, travel and hospitality, manufacturing and logistics, and energy and utilities. These clients are managing through a challenging retail and consumer business environment. And so they're giving priority to optimizing costs, transforming their supply chain, and building omni-channel customer experience solutions. We've responded with an industry-specific suite of offerings that leverage automation, big data, and cloud. Our clients in manufacturing, logistics, energy, and utilities continue to see solid growth. They're on a path of scaling their digital transformation by leveraging connected products and process reinvention. Let's look at what our Digital Systems and Technology practice is doing for Cargill, a global provider of food, agricultural, and industrial products. As part of a multiyear agreement, we will migrate Cargill's application to the cloud to modernize, transform, and run their global IT applications. We'll be applying a lean, agile delivery model that will enable Cargill to achieve best-in-class operational excellence while enhancing their go-to-market capabilities. From this quarter forward, we will refer to this segment we formerly called Other as Communications, Media and Technology. This segment grew 16.5% year over year. The name change signals our progress in developing our business in these industries and our increasing focus given their growth potential. This practice services many of our Silicon Valley digital leaders, including four of the top five born-digital platform firms. Now let's take a quick look at performance by geography. North America grew 10.6% year over year. Europe was up 6.5% over last year after a 7.4% negative currency impact. Integrating multiservice solutions and our expansion through targeted acquisitions contributed to our success in Europe. For example, clients view our recent acquisition of Mirabeau, a specialist in developing digital marketing and engaging customer experiences, as another hallmark of Cognizant's differentiated value in the marketplace. To close out our geographic discussion, we have continued strong growth in the rest of the world, which was up 25.6% year over year. As I wrap up, I want to offer a quick update on a topic I discussed on our last call. Given our attention to the H-1B visa program, we want you to know that we're evolving our workforce and delivery in the United States. Cognizant hired 4,000 U.S. citizens and residents in 2016. In 2017 and beyond, we expect to significantly ramp up our U.S.-based workforce by hiring experienced professionals in the open market and by making more use of university, veteran, and related programs. We are shifting our workforce largely in response to clients' increasing need for co-innovation and collocation. While we still seek visas for highly specialized and skilled talent, we're reducing our dependence on these visas. In fact, during the most recent filing period on April 1, we applied for less than half the number of visas we sought last year and we expect to further reduce our need for these visas going forward. As part of our shift, we continue to expand our U.S. delivery centers. A good example is our Tampa delivery center, where we employ over 1,000 technology and business professionals. They provide business process services, application services, and testing for financial services and healthcare clients. At our center, we're employing a broad skill mix that includes longtime local residents as well as veterans and recruits from local colleges. At similar delivery centers around the country, we've expanded our retraining programs and are working with local institutions to implement special curriculums that will help us meet growing client needs. Today we have over 20 U.S. delivery centers, and we continue to expand this footprint. To sum up, we are executing the shift to digital at scale by helping our clients simultaneously optimize their costs as they invest in the future. And we are shifting our workforce rapidly in the U.S., with more U.S. jobs and U.S. delivery centers. Now I'll turn over the call to Karen to discuss our financial performance Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. The business got off to a solid start in Q1, which positions us well to achieve our full-year guidance. First quarter revenue of $3.55 billion was at the high end of our guidance range and represented a year-over-year increase of 10.7%. We had a negative currency headwind, which impacted year-over-year revenue growth by $35 million or 110 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, and realignment charges, was 18.9%, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.84. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 14.2%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 27.2%. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter is lower than our previous guidance, as we recorded certain income tax benefits that were previously unrecognized in our consolidated financial statements. The timing of this adjustment was primarily driven by the lapse of the statute of limitations. As Frank outlined in his comments, we are committed to a comprehensive return of capital program. In March we launched a $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, program. Today we declared our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on May 22, 2017. This dividend will be payable on May 31, 2017. Now let me discuss additional details of our financial performance. Consulting and Technology Services and Outsourcing Services represented 57.8% and 42.2% of revenue respectively for the quarter. Consulting and Technology Services grew 10.6% year over year, driven by strong performance in Cognizant Business Consulting and an increased demand for digital solutions. Outsourcing Services revenue grew 10.9% from Q1 a year ago. During the first quarter, 38% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts. We continue to make progress over the long term towards changing the mix of our business towards more fixed-price and/or more managed services arrangements. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 336. We are strongly committed to our target of 22% non-GAAP operating margin in 2019. To ensure we achieve this target, we have engaged outside advisors and have a number of work streams underway to focus on cost and operational efficiency, increasing utilization, optimizing our pyramid structure, improving our talent supply chain to better align resources with client demand, simplifying our business unit overhead, and leveraging our corporate function spend more effectively. Within the corporate functions, we are focused on a number of areas, including but not limited to span of control, automation, and vendor consolidation. Additionally, our Board of Directors has organized and chartered our recently announced Financial Policy Committee. And as Frank and Raj mentioned, we are accelerating our shift to high-value digital transformation work while continuing to reassess less profitable opportunities that do not further our position in the digital marketplace. In Q1, we incurred approximately $11 million of charges related to our realignment program, including advisory fees and severance costs. During the remainder of 2017, we expect to incur additional costs related to severance, including those associated with our recently initiated voluntary separation program, lease terminations, and other facility-related shutdown costs and advisory fees. These actions will ultimately improve our cost structure and operating margins while allowing us to continue to invest in the business for growth. We expect to show gradual improvement in our margins throughout 2017 as these efforts take hold. We have already started driving utilization higher by slowing hiring and improving resource alignment to better meet client demand. As evidence of this, we added just 1,000 net new hires in the quarter. While we will carefully manage head count and our cost structure, it is important that we continue to hire and invest in critical skills to support our evolving digital capabilities. Annualized attrition of 14.7% during the quarter, including BPO and trainees, was roughly in line with the year-ago period. Our offshore utilization for the quarter was 74%. Offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was 79%, and onsite utilization was 91% during the quarter. We would expect these ratios to improve gradually over this year, as many of the actions we took in Q1 begin to accrue in Q2 and the remainder of the year. Turning to our balance sheet, which remains very healthy, we finished the quarter with $4.3 billion of cash and short-term investments. Net of debt, this was down by $1.2 billion from the quarter ending December 31 and $369 million from the year-ago period, reflecting the use of cash on hand to primarily fund the ASR. Receivables were $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter. We finished the quarter with a DSO, including unbilled receivables, of 72 days, flat with last quarter. Our unbilled receivables balance was $395 million, up from $349 million at the end of Q4. We billed approximately 57% of the Q1 unbilled balance in April. The increase in unbilled receivables was primarily due to the timing of certain milestone deliverables. Our outstanding debt balance was $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter, which included a $350 million outstanding balance on our revolver. Turning to cash flow, in response to investor requests, beginning with this quarter's release, we have included a condensed cash flow statement. Operating activities generated $277 million in the quarter and we invested $66 million in CapEx, resulting in $211 million of free cash in the quarter. The U.S. portion is roughly one-third of our total free cash flow. As previously mentioned, as part of our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders, we launched a $1.5 billion ASR in March. At that time, we received and retired 21.5 million shares, a portion of the total expected shares to be repurchased under the ASR. We expect to complete the transaction during or prior to the third quarter of 2017, at which time the total number of shares to be delivered will be determined based on the volume-weighted average price during this period. Our diluted share count decreased to 607 million shares for the quarter. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q2 and for the full year 2017. For the full year 2017, we expect revenue to be in the range of $14.56 billion to $14.84 billion, which represents growth of 8% to 10%. Our guidance is based on current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. For the second quarter of 2017, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $3.63 billion to $3.68 billion. We expect non-GAAP operating margins to be at least 19.4% during Q2 and at least 19.5% for the full year 2017, as the benefits of our realignment program begin to accrue. For the second quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.89. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 591 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%. For the full year, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $3.64. This guidance anticipates a full-year share count of approximately 595 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 23%. This guidance also includes the impact of the $1.5 billion ASR, and we will provide additional details on the full share count impact once the purchase has been completed. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization, and realignment charges. For the full year, it also excludes the recognition of the Q1 income tax benefit that was previously unrecognized. Our guidance does not account for any potential impacts from events like changes to immigration and tax policies. In summary, we had a strong start to 2017, and we expect to deliver solid revenue and earnings growth this year along with a substantial capital return to shareholders. Operator, now I'll turn it back over to you for any questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys, congrats on the strong quarter. Just looking over at 2Q revenue guidance, that range seems to be a little bit wider than usual. I was just curious. Is that some different demand outcomes from clients that's causing that wide a range? Because I think historically we've seen more of a pickup between 1Q sequential and 2Q growth rates. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Sure, Bryan. This is Karen, good morning. So Q2 revenue, the range is actually about the same as the ranges we've been providing in recent quarters and in Q1. It's about a $50 million range between the low and the high end of the range. One thing that we should point out that was not in the prepared remarks is this year is a little unusual with the calendar, so Q2 actually has less billing days than Q1, which is the first time in my history with the company that that's happened. And it's partially just because of the way the holidays and weekends line up this quarter. So that's why a little bit the Q2 seasonality doesn't seem quite as strong as it would in prior years. But we're very comfortable. The demand environment, as we were talking about in our prepared remarks and obviously I'm sure we'll have more conversation over the next few minutes, the demand environment continues to be solid. We haven't seen any change in that as we went into Q2. It's primarily just a matter of the number of bill days. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay, and then a quick follow up, maybe Francisco. Any changes in clients' appetite to use Cognizant services due to some of the stuff going around on immigration reform? Has anybody pulled back or looked to be more hesitant than usual? Thanks so much and congrats on the quarter. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Good morning, Bryan. I would say specifically related to immigration, we really have not seen any slowdown or impact on client demand. And overall, we were pleased with Q1 at the top end of our range. And so I think that there wasn't any impact obviously in Q1, and we haven't seen anything that concerns us going forward. Operator Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great, nice start to the year here. I'll ask about the healthcare outlook. Just a lot of noise there obviously, just curious about the progress or maybe movement in the BPaaS pipeline. Are you seeing any pent-up demand at payer clients? Maybe anything else you can give us on the outlook in healthcare this year would be great. Thanks. Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Hi, this is Raj here. Look, I think we're pleased with the start of healthcare this year. Obviously, as you know, Q1 has a lot of seasonality in there with the TriZetto business being a software business, and in addition to that our life sciences business, which has a lot of discretionary spend and budget flush that happens in Q4. So overall, we're pleased with the start of healthcare. I think obviously there's still a lot of uncertainty out there in terms of what happens with proposed legislation around the Affordable Care Act. But we are seeing some stability, especially given that some of the large M&A deals that were out there, we're starting to see some. Given that those are not moving forward, we're starting to see some pent-up demand, which is a good start for us as well too. I think look, BPaaS in terms of our platforms, we continue to see a lot of traction, a lot of client interest around our solutions, and along with that, a lot of initiatives around digital, especially around customer engagement and analytics, security, and cloud-related services. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hey, good morning, congrats. Does TriZetto, could you remind us if TriZetto has a license fee impact on the model and what quarter it might hit, or is it all spread over the life of whatever the engagement is? Thanks. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Good morning, Ed. This is Karen. So as you know, obviously when we brought TriZetto, they were very focused on software sales and had tremendous seasonality in their business, with Q4 being their strongest quarter historically. That still continues to be true. But over time, obviously, one of the things we've been trying to move them towards is more of an annuity-based structure. So in Q1 of this year, the sequential decline in TriZetto revenue was about $20 million from Q4 to Q1. That's down from last year, where it was over $25 million sequential impact from Q4 to Q1. So we're slowly starting to move them into much more of an annuity-based structure so that over time we would have less of that lumpiness. Operator Our next question is from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe dive a little bit more into the immigration comments you touched on earlier. Can you maybe give us any kind of quantification around absolute numbers of visas you applied for either last year or this year, just to give us a sense about what the half, the 50% mark implies? And maybe just give us a sense about what your plans are in terms of campus recruiting, both in India and the U.S., over the next year, and how you think about the head count additions for the rest of the year relative to some of the rationalization efforts you talked about, part of the restructuring. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Okay, why don't I  Jim, this is Frank. I'll take some of that and then I'll ask Karen to cover some parts of it. We don't disclose numbers around our use of visas for competitive reasons. But I think, as Raj said in the prepared comments, this year we filed for half the number of H-1s that we had filed last year. We wanted to put that out there just to give you a sense that we are continuing to aggressively shift the model, to continue to give you a trend line that says as the business shifts more toward digital, as our clients  as the demand from clients is more about collocation and co-innovation because that's the kind of work that digital demands, that we're shifting the model accordingly. As a U.S. company, we're committed to hiring and reskilling employees, not just in the U.S., but really in all the markets around the world where we operate. Specific to the U.S., we're hiring more here. We've got what we think are very innovative training programs with colleges to help train the next generation of technology workers. As Raj said, we're expanding the number of our U.S.-based centers. He gave you an example of the Tampa center and some color around that one. Like Tampa, we have 20 other centers like that already around the U.S. that we will continue to build and grow and expand our footprint in. And let me ask Karen to cover head count and our thinking around head count as we look through the rest of the year Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Yes, sure. Thanks, Frank. So, Jim, obviously we haven't and will not provide any head count guidance. But I think at a macro level, it's safe to assume that utilization will go up throughout the year. We will certainly continue to hire as we continue to drive forward with the change in the skills mix. So as you saw in Q1, we added about a net of 1,000 people. That will move up and down throughout the year as we bring on some of these new skills and continue to also retrain our workforce, as Frank talked about. In terms of the balance between campus and lateral hiring, that will continue to shift from quarter to quarter. As you know, we have a very robust campus hiring program in India. That continues. In the U.S., we continue to expand our campus hiring programs, and that's everything from working with local community colleges and retraining and skilling programs, all the way up through the big MBA and Master's programs. And then similarly in Europe, we also do a lot of campus recruiting there. So we've got very robust campus programs that we've put in place over the last few years, and continue to look to those as ways of expanding our local presence onsite. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi, good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could start by maybe touching on gross margin a little bit. It seems as though on the gross margin side, it was a little bit softer in the quarter. So I was just wondering what in terms of business mix, or maybe we're not accounting for charges correctly as we're backing them out, might be included in that number. And then I have a quick follow up. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Hi, Brian. This is Karen. So it was a little hard to hear you, but I think you were asking about gross margin for the quarter. Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Right. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. So gross margin, as we've talked about from time to time, will move up and down. Our focus is always on non-GAAP operating margin. But what you saw putting pressure on gross margin, we saw this last year as well, is in 2016 we hired a lot of people, and frankly, head count grew much faster than revenue. That already did start to subside, at least on a sequential basis, this quarter and will continue to subside this year and will bring those two back more in line. And certainly head count growth I would expect to grow actually slower than revenue this year. So it was really the lower utilization that was putting pressure on gross margin, but as I said, that will start to reverse itself as we get through the rest of the year. Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC And on operational efficiency initiatives, maybe if you can offer a little bit of color in terms of what you made progress with in the first quarter and how we should anticipate ongoing initiatives to trend through the remainder of the year? Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. So I think really the vast majority of the initiatives are just starting now, so I would say the January and February timeframe was a lot of planning. We want to be very thoughtful. It is most critical that we continue to invest for growth and the shift to digital that we're seeing in the business. So that's our  first and foremost, we need to make sure we protect that while at the same time, obviously, we're looking for opportunities to enhance our cost structure and further optimize our cost structure. So there were some small actions in Q1. As you saw, there was about $11 million of realignment cost that was a combination of advisory fees to help us prepare for this, as well as some severance. But most of the actions will begin here or have begun already in Q2. We just launched earlier this week a voluntary separation package. That program will go through the end of Q2, so we'll start to see the benefits of that as we get into Q3. Similarly, as we're looking at real estate and other opportunities and vendor consolidation and so forth, the vast majority of those benefits we'll start to see towards the end of Q2, but most of that will really start to kick in as we get into the back half of this year, which will then hopefully set us up very well as we move into next year and we start to see the full-year benefits of those. Operator Our next question is from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks. Hi, Frank. Hi, Raj. Hi, Karen. So the performance with regards to revenues and EPS was in line with our expectations, but the gross margin decline was a bit sharper than I expected. Can you break down the decline in terms of the impact from revenue mix versus the investments you're making or miscellaneous factors? What I'm trying to get to is how much of the impact is likely to be ongoing versus you get a recovery as you proceed through the year. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. So, Ashwin, this is Karen. I'll take that. I think similar to the answer to Brian's question, this is really about utilization in Q1. As the business mix continues to take hold, digital becomes a bigger piece of the business. We are actually seeing that business continue to be margin accretive. And we expect that to continue, and that is certainly a big piece of what will help drive our margin profile in the outer years. But in the short term, because of all the hiring we did last year and the fact that we had such a big drop in utilization year over year as we went through last year, that's really what's putting the pressure on gross margin. And as I said, we would expect that to start to reverse as the year goes on. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montréal. Please go ahead with your question. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hi, thank you. Karen, is there a way to think about how your cost base is changing? What I mean by that is you're requesting or applying for fewer visas, but you're adding more onshore labor, so your costs  your general costs are increasing per head count. Is there a way to think about how that is unfolding for the year? In other words, are your costs per head count going up by 5% or 10% or not really changing? I know some of your strategic initiatives are designed to alleviate that pressure. But is there any way to quantify as you're growing your onshore head count how that's changing your cost base? And the second part of the question is, how much more can you move mix to be offshore? We've talked to some customers, and they seem more willing to move with the H1B1  H1 issues that are arising. It seems like clients are more willing to let work move offshore. But how much more do you think room is there to move work offshore to mitigate some of the impact of what is generally I think higher cost wages that you have to pay for your onshore labor? Thanks. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Sure. So, Keith, I'll start and I think I'll let Frank add some color as well. In terms of the onsite costs, this is interesting. On a like-on-like basis, if we're hiring the same skills with a local worker versus somebody who comes over on a visa, there really isn't significant difference in the cost structure by the time you factor in the cost of the wages, the relocation, et cetera, versus the compensation that we're paying. And obviously, we have to keep in mind that when you're using the H-1B program, there are prevailing wage structures that set the salaries that we are going to pay to our people. So essentially, those salaries are set at market wage. So we're not seeing any significant difference as you shift the workforce. The biggest challenge is finding the right talent, and that has always been the concern and the challenge. So as long as you can find the right skill set, the cost structure is not significantly different. In terms of the ability to move work offshore and the willingness, I think it's the same issue. If clients can find the talent here in the U.S. or in Europe as it may apply, then I think certainly people would avail of that. But when the talent is not available, people are certainly willing to look at moving work offshore. And I will ask Frank, he may have color to add to that as well. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. I think Karen has covered it well. I have very little color to add. All I would say is that on the issue of moving more work offshore, I think in general you have to look at that by line of service. I think that generally speaking, we're pretty optimized by line of service. But on some of the older lines of service, application maintenance, quality assurance, and so on, there may be some incremental opportunity to optimize the mix there. That's driven by maturity of those service offerings, more comfort that clients have with executing in a global delivery model, and to some extent driven by advances in technology, better communications technology, better collaboration and interaction technologies. I don't think that's a significant move. And to some extent, as we look at the portfolio overall, that move is somewhat at the portfolio level offset by the digital, the new digital work that requires more collocation, co-innovation closer to the client. At a portfolio level, I'm not sure you'd see significant shifts one way or the other. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning, guys. Frank, maybe this one's for you, I imagine this transition that your business is undergoing right now is one of the biggest challenges you've had in the 20-plus years you've been there. Can you just talk about what are the most difficult aspects in your view of the transition both to digital on the revenue side as well as the margin expansion shift on the cost side of things and how you're addressing those? Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Lisa, I would say while this is a transition that we're taking the company through, I think the company  and I give the team a lot of credit. I'll take a minute here to recognize everybody on the Cognizant leadership team and all of the people around the world who have gotten behind making this transition happen. It's not dissimilar to many other transitions that we've managed through in the past. We lived through the financial crisis and came out stronger at the other end when close to 50% of our revenue back then came from the financial services industry. We made the shift from year 2000 to the Internet and e-business and so on and so forth. The company is a little bit bigger today than it was back then, so the magnitude of what we're doing is a little bit bigger, but I would say the elements are similar. The reality is that we have a very, very strong market position that comes from incredibly strong client relationships that go back many years. We understand our clients. We understand their businesses. We understand their technology environments. And our advantage in digital comes from the fact that clients are moving into this phase where they are doing digital at scale, which means they're transforming their business models, they're transforming their operating models, and they're transforming their technology models, all of these in tandem simultaneously. That is Cognizant's advantage, that we have this capability to be able to work with them to transform their business model, their operating model, and their technology model through that in tandem in one strong, solid integrated fashion. So we've got a strong value proposition. We've got a strong  in the marketplace. Now in terms of the changes, the core capabilities that we have, our consulting teams, our strong industry domain expertise, those are relevant. We are going through a large process, as I said in my prepared remarks, of re-creating and reskilling the teams. That's mostly related to new digital technologies. We're doing that at scale, so that's a heavy lift given the number of people that we need to take through that. But we've got a great workforce, a workforce that's committed to continuous learning. And so it's a question of making that happen as opposed to desire or will to have that happen. So I think we're taking the company through that. Look, I think in terms of the margin expansion program, the company is committed to this. We're looking at it as an opportunity to simplify the business, frankly. We've had 20-plus years of rapid growth. The company was probably a little bit more complicated internally than it needed to be in some areas. This is an opportunity for us to simplify. It's an opportunity for us to get better. It's an opportunity for us to be more efficient and more effective in how we do things, and the emphasis is on simplification. And given that, I think the team is rallying around that because they see that this is an opportunity for us to run the place better and be stronger as a result of that. So I think we're well on our way. We feel very good. The management team is deeply committed to this plan. We see the opportunity as we shift to digital. We see the benefits of simplifying the business. And I think as Karen said, we're off to a good start in Q1, and you'll start to see the actions on the margin front in Q2. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Operator, I think we have time for one last question. Operator Yes, that question will be coming from the line of Arvind Ramnani with Pacific Crest. Arvind Ramnani - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Hi, good quarter. So when you look at these digital projects, they're certainly gaining scale, and clients value your consulting and advisory services even more so now than in prior years. Can you talk about your consulting offering and how you're looking to scale that given your onsite hiring? Particularly among the Indian players, you're certainly well positioned, but I'm sure there's more to do on building scale. And finally, how are you also leveraging your consultants on your account (56:20) management? Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Arvind, it's Frank. There were multiple parts to that question, so I'll try to address them all, so a couple of things. I would say in terms of consulting scale-up, as you know, the consulting business at Cognizant is one that we've been building for years. And so in terms of the basics of that business and the basics of scaling that business up, I think we've got a very robust mechanism in place now. We've got strong campus hiring, MBA campus hiring, both in India and in the U.S. and Europe, so we hire MBAs from the top institutions around the world. That feeds the consulting permits. So the basic mechanism of scaling that up I think is very much in place and very strong. Having said that, as you pointed out, consulting has never been more relevant. And we continue to look to other ways to scale up our consulting group, particularly inorganically in addition to the organic things that we're doing. So you will continue to see us looking at consulting companies as part of our inorganic screen. I would say that in terms of areas of focus, we will continue to deepen in the industries that we serve our consulting capability. We're also looking to scale up technology consulting in particular areas that relate to digital around cloud migration. You will see us scaling up. We've already done, as you know, a few acquisitions in what I think of as the front end, the business model side of digital, so experience, design, creative, human factors, all of those kinds of things which are very consultative in nature. And then the last part of your question relates to integrating consulting more tightly in the client interface, and that's certainly something that we're doing. We've moved now increasingly to a model where, in addition to having client partners on our biggest clients, which is the historical model, we're also infusing the client interface with more dedicated, more full-time consultants from the Cognizant business consulting team. So all of that very much in the works and continues to scale up, so hopefully that addresses all the parts of your questions. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. And with that, I think we're just about out of time. So I want to end by thanking everybody again for joining us today. Thanks very much for your questions. And as always, we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks, everybody. Operator This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions first quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

So Q2 revenue, the range is actually about the same as the ranges we've been providing in recent quarters and in Q1. It's about a $50 million range between the low and the high end of the range. One thing that we should point out that was not in the prepared remarks is this year is a little unusual with the calendar, so Q2 actually has less billing days than Q1, which is the first time in my history with the company that that's happened. And it's partially just because of the way the holidays and weekends line up this quarter. So that's why a little bit the Q2 seasonality doesn't seem quite as strong as it would in prior years. But we're very comfortable. The demand environment, as we were talking about in our prepared remarks and obviously I'm sure we'll have more conversation over the next few minutes, the demand environment continues to be solid. We haven't seen any change in that as we went into Q2. It's primarily just a matter of the number of bill days. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay, and then a quick follow up, maybe Francisco. Any changes in clients' appetite to use Cognizant services due to some of the stuff going around on immigration reform? Has anybody pulled back or looked to be more hesitant than usual? Thanks so much and congrats on the quarter. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Good morning, Bryan. I would say specifically related to immigration, we really have not seen any slowdown or impact on client demand. And overall, we were pleased with Q1 at the top end of our range. And so I think that there wasn't any impact obviously in Q1, and we haven't seen anything that concerns us going forward. Operator Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great, nice start to the year here. I'll ask about the healthcare outlook. Just a lot of noise there obviously, just curious about the progress or maybe movement in the BPaaS pipeline. Are you seeing any pent-up demand at payer clients? Maybe anything else you can give us on the outlook in healthcare this year would be great. Thanks. Rajeev Mehta - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Hi, this is Raj here. Look, I think we're pleased with the start of healthcare this year. Obviously, as you know, Q1 has a lot of seasonality in there with the TriZetto business being a software business, and in addition to that our life sciences business, which has a lot of discretionary spend and budget flush that happens in Q4. So overall, we're pleased with the start of healthcare. I think obviously there's still a lot of uncertainty out there in terms of what happens with proposed legislation around the Affordable Care Act. But we are seeing some stability, especially given that some of the large M&A deals that were out there, we're starting to see some. Given that those are not moving forward, we're starting to see some pent-up demand, which is a good start for us as well too. I think look, BPaaS in terms of our platforms, we continue to see a lot of traction, a lot of client interest around our solutions, and along with that, a lot of initiatives around digital, especially around customer engagement and analytics, security, and cloud-related services. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Edward S. Caso - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hey, good morning, congrats. Does TriZetto, could you remind us if TriZetto has a license fee impact on the model and what quarter it might hit, or is it all spread over the life of whatever the engagement is? Thanks. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Good morning, Ed. This is Karen. So as you know, obviously when we brought TriZetto, they were very focused on software sales and had tremendous seasonality in their business, with Q4 being their strongest quarter historically. That still continues to be true. But over time, obviously, one of the things we've been trying to move them towards is more of an annuity-based structure. So in Q1 of this year, the sequential decline in TriZetto revenue was about $20 million from Q4 to Q1. That's down from last year, where it was over $25 million sequential impact from Q4 to Q1. So we're slowly starting to move them into much more of an annuity-based structure so that over time we would have less of that lumpiness. Operator Our next question is from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe dive a little bit more into the immigration comments you touched on earlier. Can you maybe give us any kind of quantification around absolute numbers of visas you applied for either last year or this year, just to give us a sense about what the half, the 50% mark implies? And maybe just give us a sense about what your plans are in terms of campus recruiting, both in India and the U.S., over the next year, and how you think about the head count additions for the rest of the year relative to some of the rationalization efforts you talked about, part of the restructuring. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Okay, why don't I  Jim, this is Frank. I'll take some of that and then I'll ask Karen to cover some parts of it. We don't disclose numbers around our use of visas for competitive reasons. But I think, as Raj said in the prepared comments, this year we filed for half the number of H-1s that we had filed last year. We wanted to put that out there just to give you a sense that we are continuing to aggressively shift the model, to continue to give you a trend line that says as the business shifts more toward digital, as our clients  as the demand from clients is more about collocation and co-innovation because that's the kind of work that digital demands, that we're shifting the model accordingly. As a U.S. company, we're committed to hiring and reskilling employees, not just in the U.S., but really in all the markets around the world where we operate. Specific to the U.S., we're hiring more here. We've got what we think are very innovative training programs with colleges to help train the next generation of technology workers. As Raj said, we're expanding the number of our U.S.-based centers. He gave you an example of the Tampa center and some color around that one. Like Tampa, we have 20 other centers like that already around the U.S. that we will continue to build and grow and expand our footprint in. And let me ask Karen to cover head count and our thinking around head count as we look through the rest of the year Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Yes, sure. Thanks, Frank. So, Jim, obviously we haven't and will not provide any head count guidance. But I think at a macro level, it's safe to assume that utilization will go up throughout the year. We will certainly continue to hire as we continue to drive forward with the change in the skills mix. So as you saw in Q1, we added about a net of 1,000 people. That will move up and down throughout the year as we bring on some of these new skills and continue to also retrain our workforce, as Frank talked about. In terms of the balance between campus and lateral hiring, that will continue to shift from quarter to quarter. As you know, we have a very robust campus hiring program in India. That continues. In the U.S., we continue to expand our campus hiring programs, and that's everything from working with local community colleges and retraining and skilling programs, all the way up through the big MBA and Master's programs. And then similarly in Europe, we also do a lot of campus recruiting there. So we've got very robust campus programs that we've put in place over the last few years, and continue to look to those as ways of expanding our local presence onsite. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi, good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could start by maybe touching on gross margin a little bit. It seems as though on the gross margin side, it was a little bit softer in the quarter. So I was just wondering what in terms of business mix, or maybe we're not accounting for charges correctly as we're backing them out, might be included in that number. And then I have a quick follow up. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Hi, Brian. This is Karen. So it was a little hard to hear you, but I think you were asking about gross margin for the quarter. Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Right. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. So gross margin, as we've talked about from time to time, will move up and down. Our focus is always on non-GAAP operating margin. But what you saw putting pressure on gross margin, we saw this last year as well, is in 2016 we hired a lot of people, and frankly, head count grew much faster than revenue. That already did start to subside, at least on a sequential basis, this quarter and will continue to subside this year and will bring those two back more in line. And certainly head count growth I would expect to grow actually slower than revenue this year. So it was really the lower utilization that was putting pressure on gross margin, but as I said, that will start to reverse itself as we get through the rest of the year. Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC And on operational efficiency initiatives, maybe if you can offer a little bit of color in terms of what you made progress with in the first quarter and how we should anticipate ongoing initiatives to trend through the remainder of the year? Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. So I think really the vast majority of the initiatives are just starting now, so I would say the January and February timeframe was a lot of planning. We want to be very thoughtful. It is most critical that we continue to invest for growth and the shift to digital that we're seeing in the business. So that's our  first and foremost, we need to make sure we protect that while at the same time, obviously, we're looking for opportunities to enhance our cost structure and further optimize our cost structure. So there were some small actions in Q1. As you saw, there was about $11 million of realignment cost that was a combination of advisory fees to help us prepare for this, as well as some severance. But most of the actions will begin here or have begun already in Q2. We just launched earlier this week a voluntary separation package. That program will go through the end of Q2, so we'll start to see the benefits of that as we get into Q3. Similarly, as we're looking at real estate and other opportunities and vendor consolidation and so forth, the vast majority of those benefits we'll start to see towards the end of Q2, but most of that will really start to kick in as we get into the back half of this year, which will then hopefully set us up very well as we move into next year and we start to see the full-year benefits of those. Operator Our next question is from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks. Hi, Frank. Hi, Raj. Hi, Karen. So the performance with regards to revenues and EPS was in line with our expectations, but the gross margin decline was a bit sharper than I expected. Can you break down the decline in terms of the impact from revenue mix versus the investments you're making or miscellaneous factors? What I'm trying to get to is how much of the impact is likely to be ongoing versus you get a recovery as you proceed through the year. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. So, Ashwin, this is Karen. I'll take that. I think similar to the answer to Brian's question, this is really about utilization in Q1. As the business mix continues to take hold, digital becomes a bigger piece of the business. We are actually seeing that business continue to be margin accretive. And we expect that to continue, and that is certainly a big piece of what will help drive our margin profile in the outer years. But in the short term, because of all the hiring we did last year and the fact that we had such a big drop in utilization year over year as we went through last year, that's really what's putting the pressure on gross margin. And as I said, we would expect that to start to reverse as the year goes on. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montréal. Please go ahead with your question. Keith Frances Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hi, thank you. Karen, is there a way to think about how your cost base is changing? What I mean by that is you're requesting or applying for fewer visas, but you're adding more onshore labor, so your costs  your general costs are increasing per head count. Is there a way to think about how that is unfolding for the year? In other words, are your costs per head count going up by 5% or 10% or not really changing? I know some of your strategic initiatives are designed to alleviate that pressure. But is there any way to quantify as you're growing your onshore head count how that's changing your cost base? And the second part of the question is, how much more can you move mix to be offshore? We've talked to some customers, and they seem more willing to move with the H1B1  H1 issues that are arising. It seems like clients are more willing to let work move offshore. But how much more do you think room is there to move work offshore to mitigate some of the impact of what is generally I think higher cost wages that you have to pay for your onshore labor? Thanks. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Sure. So, Keith, I'll start and I think I'll let Frank add some color as well. In terms of the onsite costs, this is interesting. On a like-on-like basis, if we're hiring the same skills with a local worker versus somebody who comes over on a visa, there really isn't significant difference in the cost structure by the time you factor in the cost of the wages, the relocation, et cetera, versus the compensation that we're paying. And obviously, we have to keep in mind that when you're using the H-1B program, there are prevailing wage structures that set the salaries that we are going to pay to our people. So essentially, those salaries are set at market wage. So we're not seeing any significant difference as you shift the workforce. The biggest challenge is finding the right talent, and that has always been the concern and the challenge. So as long as you can find the right skill set, the cost structure is not significantly different. In terms of the ability to move work offshore and the willingness, I think it's the same issue. If clients can find the talent here in the U.S. or in Europe as it may apply, then I think certainly people would avail of that. But when the talent is not available, people are certainly willing to look at moving work offshore. And I will ask Frank, he may have color to add to that as well. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. I think Karen has covered it well. I have very little color to add. All I would say is that on the issue of moving more work offshore, I think in general you have to look at that by line of service. I think that generally speaking, we're pretty optimized by line of service. But on some of the older lines of service, application maintenance, quality assurance, and so on, there may be some incremental opportunity to optimize the mix there. That's driven by maturity of those service offerings, more comfort that clients have with executing in a global delivery model, and to some extent driven by advances in technology, better communications technology, better collaboration and interaction technologies. I don't think that's a significant move. And to some extent, as we look at the portfolio overall, that move is somewhat at the portfolio level offset by the digital, the new digital work that requires more collocation, co-innovation closer to the client. At a portfolio level, I'm not sure you'd see significant shifts one way or the other. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning, guys. Frank, maybe this one's for you, I imagine this transition that your business is undergoing right now is one of the biggest challenges you've had in the 20-plus years you've been there. Can you just talk about what are the most difficult aspects in your view of the transition both to digital on the revenue side as well as the margin expansion shift on the cost side of things and how you're addressing those? Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Lisa, I would say while this is a transition that we're taking the company through, I think the company  and I give the team a lot of credit. I'll take a minute here to recognize everybody on the Cognizant leadership team and all of the people around the world who have gotten behind making this transition happen. It's not dissimilar to many other transitions that we've managed through in the past. We lived through the financial crisis and came out stronger at the other end when close to 50% of our revenue back then came from the financial services industry. We made the shift from year 2000 to the Internet and e-business and so on and so forth. The company is a little bit bigger today than it was back then, so the magnitude of what we're doing is a little bit bigger, but I would say the elements are similar. The reality is that we have a very, very strong market position that comes from incredibly strong client relationships that go back many years. We understand our clients. We understand their businesses. We understand their technology environments. And our advantage in digital comes from the fact that clients are moving into this phase where they are doing digital at scale, which means they're transforming their business models, they're transforming their operating models, and they're transforming their technology models, all of these in tandem simultaneously. That is Cognizant's advantage, that we have this capability to be able to work with them to transform their business model, their operating model, and their technology model through that in tandem in one strong, solid integrated fashion. So we've got a strong value proposition. We've got a strong  in the marketplace. Now in terms of the changes, the core capabilities that we have, our consulting teams, our strong industry domain expertise, those are relevant. We are going through a large process, as I said in my prepared remarks, of re-creating and reskilling the teams. That's mostly related to new digital technologies. We're doing that at scale, so that's a heavy lift given the number of people that we need to take through that. But we've got a great workforce, a workforce that's committed to continuous learning. And so it's a question of making that happen as opposed to desire or will to have that happen. So I think we're taking the company through that. Look, I think in terms of the margin expansion program, the company is committed to this. We're looking at it as an opportunity to simplify the business, frankly. We've had 20-plus years of rapid growth. The company was probably a little bit more complicated internally than it needed to be in some areas. This is an opportunity for us to simplify. It's an opportunity for us to get better. It's an opportunity for us to be more efficient and more effective in how we do things, and the emphasis is on simplification. And given that, I think the team is rallying around that because they see that this is an opportunity for us to run the place better and be stronger as a result of that. So I think we're well on our way. We feel very good. The management team is deeply committed to this plan. We see the opportunity as we shift to digital. We see the benefits of simplifying the business. And I think as Karen said, we're off to a good start in Q1, and you'll start to see the actions on the margin front in Q2. Karen McLoughlin - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Operator, I think we have time for one last question. Operator Yes, that question will be coming from the line of Arvind Ramnani with Pacific Crest. Arvind Ramnani - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Hi, good quarter. So when you look at these digital projects, they're certainly gaining scale, and clients value your consulting and advisory services even more so now than in prior years. Can you talk about your consulting offering and how you're looking to scale that given your onsite hiring? Particularly among the Indian players, you're certainly well positioned, but I'm sure there's more to do on building scale. And finally, how are you also leveraging your consultants on your account (56:20) management? Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. Arvind, it's Frank. There were multiple parts to that question, so I'll try to address them all, so a couple of things. I would say in terms of consulting scale-up, as you know, the consulting business at Cognizant is one that we've been building for years. And so in terms of the basics of that business and the basics of scaling that business up, I think we've got a very robust mechanism in place now. We've got strong campus hiring, MBA campus hiring, both in India and in the U.S. and Europe, so we hire MBAs from the top institutions around the world. That feeds the consulting permits. So the basic mechanism of scaling that up I think is very much in place and very strong. Having said that, as you pointed out, consulting has never been more relevant. And we continue to look to other ways to scale up our consulting group, particularly inorganically in addition to the organic things that we're doing. So you will continue to see us looking at consulting companies as part of our inorganic screen. I would say that in terms of areas of focus, we will continue to deepen in the industries that we serve our consulting capability. We're also looking to scale up technology consulting in particular areas that relate to digital around cloud migration. You will see us scaling up. We've already done, as you know, a few acquisitions in what I think of as the front end, the business model side of digital, so experience, design, creative, human factors, all of those kinds of things which are very consultative in nature. And then the last part of your question relates to integrating consulting more tightly in the client interface, and that's certainly something that we're doing. We've moved now increasingly to a model where, in addition to having client partners on our biggest clients, which is the historical model, we're also infusing the client interface with more dedicated, more full-time consultants from the Cognizant business consulting team. So all of that very much in the works and continues to scale up, so hopefully that addresses all the parts of your questions. Francisco D'Souza - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. And with that, I think we're just about out of time. So I want to end by thanking everybody again for joining us today. Thanks very much for your questions. And as always, we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks, everybody. Operator This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions first quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheets, cash flow statements and other financial information can also be found in the Financial Information section of our Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis, unless stated otherwise.  The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I will now turn it over to Chuck. Charles Robbins Thank you, Marilyn and good afternoon, everyone. Our results this quarter demonstrated that we're delivering against our strategic priorities and realizing the benefits of our investments to transform our business and drive long term shareholder value.  We delivered a solid quarter, with total revenue of $11.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.60. We had strong margins yet again and great operating cash flow, up 10%. We're managing the business well through a multiyear transformation of the company while remaining focused on delivering customers unparalleled value through highly secure, software-defined automated and intelligent infrastructure. We're on a journey which as we consistently stated, will take a number of years, but we're pleased with the progress we're making. As our customers add billions of new connections in the years ahead, the network will become more critical than ever. They will be looking for intelligent networks that deliver automation, security and analytics that help them derive meaningful business value from these connections. These will be delivered through a combination of new platforms as well as software and subscription-based services which we've been focused on accelerating over the last 18 months. My vision for this company is to be the most relevant and most important partner for our customers as they enable their digital businesses and we will deliver on that vision. I look forward to discussing this in a lot more detail at our Investor Day on June 28.  We continue to innovate across our networking portfolio with analytics being a key element of this innovation. This quarter, we completed the acquisition of AppDynamics, enabling us to provide customers with unprecedented visibility across networking, data center, security and applications. As I talk to our customers and partners, I'm getting great feedback about the value of the insights AppDynamics provides to help them make informed business decisions. We're in the early stages of scaling out the AppDynamics solutions through the Cisco Salesforce and partner ecosystem and I'm excited about the future of this space.  We were also pleased to announce our intent to acquire some new additions to our software and analytics portfolio. Software-defined WAN is a critical market transition and addresses the evolving customer demands and branch routing as a foundational block of executing in cloud networking. Viptela, combined with Cisco's IWAN technology, will provide an industry-leading cloud-first SD WAN platform that addresses the Edge networking needs of our most demanding customers.  MindMeld provides an AI platform to build intelligent and humanlike conversational interfaces for any application or device and will complement our already strong collaboration portfolio. These acquisitions support our goal of offering customers extraordinary value through a combination of organic and inorganic innovation and they are aligned to our strategy of investing to drive longer term growth and helping us transition to more recurring software and subscription revenue. We will continue to deploy our capital resources to give us first-mover advantage as we extend our technology portfolio. In addition to our inorganic growth, we're seeing strong organic growth of our next-generation products and solutions in both networking and security.  Now let me share some business highlights, starting with our security business which has never been more relevant, as we've seen in recent days. Last week's WannaCry ransomware attack was another example of the devastating impact cybercrime can inflict on individuals, companies and countries around the world. Since Friday's attack, our Talos cyber threat intelligence team has been working around-the-clock to dissect the WannaCry ransomware, understand its attack patterns and keep our customers protected. It's important that the tech industry and customers work together to defend against these attacks from cyber criminals. We will continue to do everything we can to help our customers anticipate, prevent and protect themselves from any future attack by harnessing the intelligence of the network and the power of our security portfolio. Our security business delivered another solid quarter with 9% revenue growth and 39% deferred revenue growth, reflecting our combination of best-of-breed solutions, together with the industry's broadest security portfolio and a highly effective end-to-end security architecture.  We continue to lead in network security. Our next-generation firewall portfolio grew 49% with 6,000 new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer base to over 73,000.  We expanded our portfolio with the announcement of our Firepower 2100 Series which offers both performance and protection for mission-critical applications.  Our Advanced threat portfolio continues to deliver strong revenue growth of over 30% and we added 6,600 new customers, bringing the total number of AMP customers to over 35,000. Now let's turn to collaboration. In January, we introduced Cisco's Spark Board, the first all-in-one cloud-based collaboration and meeting room solution. We've seen good early traction with this SaaS-based service, with nearly 700 customers adopting this solution in the quarter. This is a great example of the transition I mentioned earlier focused on moving from standalone systems to best-of-breed products, combined with software subscriptions.  Our intended acquisition of MindMeld will help us simplify and enhance the collaboration experience even further through the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning. As chat and voice quickly become the interfaces of choice, MindMeld's AI technology will enable Cisco to deliver unique experiences throughout its portfolio. This acquisition will power new conversational interfaces for Cisco's collaboration products, revolutionizing how users will interact with our technology while increasing ease-of-use and enabling new capabilities. For example, users will be able to interact with Cisco Spark via Natural Language Commands, providing an experience that is highly customized to the user and their work.  In our data center switching business, we now have a combined install base of over 20,000 customers, who are using our portfolio to help them build, run and manage their private and hybrid cloud environments.  Our ACI portfolio grew 42%, as customers moved to 100-gig and look to automate the network and increase network performance, visibility and security. We added almost 1,200 new Nexus 9K customers in the quarter, bringing the total installed base to 12,000. Our APIC adoption continues to increase rapidly with over 380 new ACI customers in Q3, bringing our total to nearly 3,500.  Before I turn it over to Kelly, let me reiterate a few key points. I'm pleased with the progress we're making. As I've consistently stated, this transition will take time, but we're remaking this company to succeed in a dramatically changing marketplace. We're laser-focused on delivering innovation as well as aggressively managing the business to optimize profitability, cash flows and value for our shareholders. Kelly? Kelly Kramer Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter followed by the Q4 outlook. Q3 was a solid quarter with financial results consistent with our expectations. We executed well, driving solid profitability, strong cash flow and we continued to deliver on our strategic growth priorities. Total revenue was $11.9 billion, down 1%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.60, up 5% and operating cash flow grew 10% to $3.4 billion. We generated 31% of our total revenue from recurring offers, up from 29% a year ago. We continue to be extremely focused on driving margins and profitability, increasing our non-GAAP operating margin to 32.3%, up 2.3 points.  Before I go through Q3 in more detail, I want to remind you that Q3 last year included an extra week, it resulted in higher revenue in that quarter of $265 million, $200 million of which was in Services and $65 million from our SaaS businesses like WebEx and some from product distributions. We also had higher non-GAAP cost of sales and operating expenses of $150 million. This netted to $115 million of higher non-GAAP operating income last year. So onto this quarter. Total product revenue was flat year-over-year. I'll walk through each of the product areas. Switching grew 2%, with solid growth in data center switching, driven by ongoing strength in the ACI portfolio which was up 42%. We also saw a slight positive growth in our campus business.  Routing was down 2%, driven primarily by weakness in mobile packet core. Collaboration was down 4%, but adjusting for the extra week last year, it was down 2%. The drivers are primarily a decline in Unified Communications' endpoints, partially offset by continued growth in WebEx. Deferred revenue grew 10%. Data center declined 5% with the continued market shift from blade to rack. However, we're seeing solid traction with our hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex. This quarter, we also further extended our innovations in UCS with new converged solutions for IBM versus stack and with our strategic alliance with Docker to deliver containerized applications. Wireless grew 13% with strong Meraki performance as well as the ramp of our 11 AC Wave 2 portfolio. We continue to innovate with the launch in the quarter of new wireless networking solutions, including a new Wave 2 access point and a wireless controller. Security was up 9% with strong performance in unified threat management, with growth of approximately 50% as well as growth of over 30% in both advanced threat and web security. Deferred revenue grew 39%, demonstrating the value of our solutions and ongoing delivery of innovation.Services was down 2%. Normalized for the extra week, it grew 4%. We're continuing to focus on renewals and attach rates.  We drove good growth in deferred revenue which was 13% in total, with product up 26% and services up 7%. Deferred products revenue from our recurring software and subscription businesses was up 57% to $4.4 billion which includes the acquisition of AppDynamics during the Quarter. Excluding AppDynamics, the increase was 51%. In terms of orders, total product orders declined 4%.  Looking at our geographies which is a primary way we run the business, Americas was down 4%, EMEA was down 6% and APJC grew 2%. Total emerging markets declined 12%, with the BRICS plus Mexico down 10%. In our customer segments, Enterprise declined 2%, Commercial grew 1%, Public Sector was down 4% and Service Provider declined 10%.  From a non-GAAP profitability perspective, total gross margin was 64.4%, down by 0.8 points. In Q3 '16, the extra week resulted in a 0.5 point benefit in that quarter. So adjusting for that, total gross margin decreased 0.3 points.In Q3 '17, our Product gross margin was 63.2%, down 1.3 points and Service gross margin was 67.8%, growing 0.7 points. We increased our operating margin by 2.3 points to 32.3% from a year ago.  In terms of the bottom line, we grew non-GAAP EPS 5% to $0.60, while GAAP EPS was $0.50. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $68.0 billion, with $2.9 billion available in the U.S. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned approximately $2 billion to our shareholders during the quarter that included $0.5 billion of share repurchases and $1.5 billion for our quarterly dividend, reflecting the 12% increase we announced last quarter. To summarize, Q3 was a solid quarter and we executed well. We're focused on driving operational efficiencies and profitability, enabling us to make the strategic investments to drive long term shareholder value.  Let me reiterate our guidance for the fourth quarter. This guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier. We expect revenue in the range of minus 4% to minus 6% year-over-year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30.5% and the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.60 to $0.62.  I'll now turn it back to Chuck for some closing comments. Charles Robbins Thanks, Kelly and thanks again to all of you for joining us today. As I mentioned earlier, we delivered another solid quarter and we're executing well. We're confident in our strategy for long term growth and profitability. We believe that the network will become increasingly important in solving our customers' most complex business problems and helping them get secure and stay secure.  We also believe that we will continue to see strong momentum in our shift towards more software and subscription revenue. This reflects the success of the investments we're making in this area -- in these areas, together with the flexible consumption and buying models we're offering our customers.  Marilyn and I'll turn it back to you for questions. Marilyn Mora Great. Thanks, Chuck. Shaun, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Q - Mark Moskowitz I wanted to see if we could understand more of the guidance, Kelly and Chuck. The revenues are little lighter than we had anticipated. Is that a function of macro factors? Or is that a function more of the shift to the subscription model or maybe there's going to be some disturbance here and there. Clearly, the deferred revenue -- product revenue growth is quite nice, but I was just wondering if there's any sort of puts and takes you could walk us through there. I really appreciate it. A - Charles Robbins Kelly, why don't you take him through the bridge and then I'll just make some comments? A - Kelly Kramer Sure. So Mark, when we look at guidance, it's a combination of many factors, right? It starts with our backlog and then orders on them, the funnel. And then yes, definitely, we take into account our transition to more software and subscriptions and how that's impacting it. So when I look at the guidance we just gave, our orders were a little weaker in Q3 which does mean that I'm starting with the lower backlog than anticipated. And then when I'm assuming, when I look at the order strength, we're assuming what we saw in Q3 continues on in Q4. So just to give some color around that. Where we had -- we have been facing headwinds all quarter long with SP and emerging. We saw them get worse this quarter that you saw in the numbers there. I'm expecting that to continue. And then we saw some new kind of macro issues in the areas like Public Sector and the U.S. Fed space and things like that. So I'm assuming that orders in line that we saw in Q3 is going to continue on in Q4. And then finally, we're seeing an impact because you're seeing it go to the balance sheet of this transition that we're just accelerating through to the tune of 1.5 to 2 points. So the combination of those 3 things are driving the guidance into that minus-4 to minus-6 range. A - Charles Robbins Yes, just -- Mark, a couple of comments on what Kelly just described. I mean, the Public Sector business, particularly in the United States, the federal business is, frankly, it's about 1 point of that guide. It's a pretty significant stall right now with the lack of budget visibility. And when you think about the strategy that we're deploying, the 57% growth in the software and subscription business, if you just go back 8 quarters ago, we had $2 billion on our balance sheet relative to software and subscription. And the first 2 or 3 quarters, we were convincing the teams that, that was the shift we were going to make. And now we have more than doubled that to $4.4 billion and the growth there is accelerating. So we're very pleased with that transition. And at the same time we deal with all of these challenges, we're also, -- we remain very committed to earnings. We remain very committed to our capital return strategy. Operator The next question is coming from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Q - Ittai Kidron Chuck, I'm going to take a U-turn this time, actually not ask you about the data center business but rather focus a little bit more on the gross margins. Some of the commentary in your press release talked about some pricing pressures. If you could give us a little bit more color on the guidance and your gross margin assumption into the guidance, how much of that is mix-related and how much of that is pricing? And if -- any color you could give on the pricing, how much is competitive versus, I don't know, product shifts or something like that, that'll be great. A - Charles Robbins Thanks, Ittai. So Kelly, let's have the same strategy. You want to go through the math on this and then... A - Kelly Kramer So Ittai, when we look at the drivers of our growth margin, price in Q3 actually has been in the same range that it was pretty much last year as well as last quarter in terms of the price index that we're seeing. So that's in the same range. Again, it's high, but it's in the range. It's not increasing. I would say in terms of the guidance for Q4, we're assuming that. We're also making sure the teams are being very aggressive where they need to be aggressive in areas and then against competitors where we need to be. But overall, the pricing hasn't changed dramatically besides the normal erosion that we see in churned business lines. I'd say, in terms of mix, that hasn't dramatically changed as well, with switching being positive this quarter, that helped a lot. And again, well, the mix isn't changing. There's mix changes with MBEs in the guidance going forward but it's nothing dramatic. So I'd say we feel good about being able to continue driving the margins that we have. The only other piece I'll comment on, because we mentioned it before, we're still seeing some cost pressure from the increase in DRAM pricing that was got baked in both our Q3 as well as into Q4. But we've been doing a lot of work and our supply chain team has done working with our suppliers to make sure we can secure our forward supply at prices that we can plan on. So I think we've pretty much got that boxed in for the guidance. Operator Next question is coming from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Q - James Faucette Just a couple of quick follow-up questions to some of the comments that have already been made. Can you talk a little bit about the orders and you mentioned that fed was weak. But when you look at the other areas of weakness, can you talk about, like, what's driving those, et cetera? And I guess, more long term, it continues to be a good deferred revenue growth and you mentioned the security. What are the priorities that your customers are showing in the security space generally? And what are you able to address now versus where are the things that they're asking for that you think you need to improve on? A - Charles Robbins Great. Thanks, James. And so we have some order color and then securities. So let me take the order stuff and then, Kelly, chime in as you'd like. So if we just go around -- sort of go around the globe, let me just highlight what we saw. And I'm just going to tell you what drove the weakness in these areas so you can assume the other pieces of the business were pretty much as expected. In the Americas, it was primarily the U.S. federal -- I mean, there's so much uncertainty around budgets. The U.S. federal business was a significant driver. Mexico, there has been a lot of uncertainty in Mexico and that was actually down 49% for us year-over-year. So it was -- there's a great deal of uncertainty around the investment landscape there. And then the third element would have been the Service Provider business in the Americas. So those were the things that really drove the orders in the U.S. In Europe, the U.K., the currency issue in the U.K. is real and was very impactful in that business. And then we continue to see pressure in the Middle East relative to oil prices. We also -- obviously, there's been a lot of uncertainty around the geopolitical dynamics, some of which have been clarified recently, obviously. And we did see some strength in some countries there, but the U.K. is a big country for us. And the Middle East, obviously, with the uncertainty around oil prices, continues to be a little bit of a pressure as well. In APJC, we saw Japan and Australia were reasonable. India was solid again. And China, we had tough comps from the SP Video business from a year ago that we talked about. So that's really what we saw from an orders perspective. I think if you look at customer segments, just to give you some color, Enterprise, the challenge was largely driven by Europe. Commercial, the lightness there was driven by Europe. Public Sector, as I said, was U.S. Federal and SP was fairly consistent. So Kelly, any other comments on that? A - Kelly Kramer Yes. A - Charles Robbins Just quickly on the securities, since you snuck that one in, too, James. The -- what our customers -- what we see happening in security right now is that as our customers prepare for the next few years and literally adding billions of new connections, we obviously believe that the network is going to become even more relevant than it ever has been. And our customers are going to need -- to deal with that scale, they're going to need significant automation. They're going to need greater insights coming out of their technology infrastructure like the network through analytics. They're going to need security embedded at the network layer because you're going to have to begin to secure the infrastructure the minute these packets hit the wire. So what they're looking for is -- they are looking for an end-to-end architecture now for dealing with security. They're looking for an open architecture that actually allows them to buy the best-of-breed technology which we have across many elements of what they're trying to do. But they are looking for an architecture and they're looking for -- to leverage as much of that from the cloud and which correspondingly turns into the subscription business, as you pointed out. So that's what we see happening there. There's obviously lots of other areas within that architecture that we don't play today where we could and we continue to assess all of those opportunities. Operator The next question is coming from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. The next question on queue, coming from Simon Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Q - Simona Jankowski It's Simona Jankowski. Just a couple of follow-ups. First, if you can clarify in terms of the weakness you saw incrementally in the Service Provider and emerging market theaters. How much of that was related to competition or pricing pressure such as from Huawei versus some of the macro factors you discussed? And then just a quick follow-up on how did your cloud business do this quarter. A - Charles Robbins So let me comment on the first one and then, Kelly, maybe you can talk about the cloud business and how we -- I'll talk about both of them but then how we measure that specifically. So the weakness in emerging and SP, I would say, in emerging, I would say it's less. We clearly -- we've been -- we've had competition from several vendors. And clearly, Huawei is a very strong competitor. I don't feel like it has increased significantly in the emerging countries. It's been pretty consistent there and our teams know how to compete and we continue to evolve our strategy and bring different tools to help them compete. So I don't -- I wouldn't say that had much to do with it. I think on our overarching cloud business, Simona, we look at that in many, many different ways. So we look at, obviously, our private cloud business which is made up of the UCS business as well as our data center switching portfolio which we talked about earlier. Both of those, the UCS business was down 5, as you saw. And then the -- obviously, our next-generation switching portfolio continues to do well, the ACI elements up 42%. And if you're asking about the MSDC guys which are the web scale cloud guys, it's the same as we were last quarter. These -- we have -- we're engaging with them on an individual basis. We look at the big ones as, frankly, markets of one. We have made great progress with a few of them. Others we're in the early stages and we have codevelopment opportunities. But I would tell you, we're in very deep discussions with most all of them and we're looking at very strategic partnerships that scale beyond even just selling infrastructure to them in many cases. So I'm not sure where you're going with cloud. Hopefully one of those answers cover what you're looking for. Operator Next question on queue is coming from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. You may now begin. Your next on queue is coming from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse Securities. Your line is open, you may now begin. Q - Kulbinder Garcha For Chuck maybe. On the revenue side, I take your points on the macro economy and the weakness in emerging markets. A - Charles Robbins Kulbinder, could you just speak up just a hair, buddy? Q - Kulbinder Garcha My question is on revenue growth, I think the drivers of the weak guidance you're talking about. I guess, the broader question is how important is getting this company back to growth? It looks like last year, you did grow. This year, you're probably not going to grow very much, i.e. especially organically. So is there something more transformative have to happen on the M&A front? Do you think this is temporary in nature? I know you're having this headwind of this business transformation, but just the importance of revenue growth to Cisco as a company, if you could comment on that for the long term. A - Charles Robbins Yes, Kulbinder, I think that -- when we look to the future right now and you really think about the number of new connections that are going to be added, that our customers will be adding over the coming years and the need for automation, the need for analytics and security, what we have done and it'll be done -- our solutions that we'll bringing in the space with a combination, to your point, of inorganic capabilities, as we have shown our ability to do, as well as some organic innovation. I've talked to several of you over the last few quarters about the fact that we went in and reallocated a fair amount of our R&D expense last year and over last 18 months.  And many of those solutions are targeting these next-generation networks that our customers are going to need to build out to support this new infrastructure. And with a high degree of automation across the network, with a high degree of analytics, with distributed compute capabilities for processing the data at the Edge as well as the security piece. So we have future innovation that will come in that space. We'll also use a combination of inorganic options where we need it. And we believe that as we get into the next generation of the networks that the customers need to build out, that we will be very successful with our capabilities. Operator The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo, you may now begin. Q - Jess Lubert I was hoping you could provide a little more detail regarding the order weakness you're flagging in the North American service provider vertical. Last quarter, if I remember correctly, you suggested orders there were improving a little bit. So I just want to understand the change. To what degree it's a technology issue versus a macro issue, the duration, you think, that's likely to be weak for and if there's if any areas within the vertical that are better or worse, that would be helpful. A - Charles Robbins Let me just give you a couple of comments and then Kelly can give us any specifics. As I said 2 quarters back, I think, when we had the negative 10% growth or 12% or whatever it was, 12%, I think. A - Kelly Kramer Yes, [indiscernible]. A - Charles Robbins This -- Our entire SP business around the world is driven by very large customers. And so when some number of them have an off quarter, it can affect the business. And I think the Americas would be probably an example of that this quarter as well. And the Mexico business that I discussed is heavily influenced by service providers. And so that's a bit of what we've seen. We had some customers in the U.S. that were performed very well this quarter for us and others that did not. Kelly, any comment on the numbers? A - Kelly Kramer Yes. No, I'd say, I think you hit on it. I think with the Americas being down so much, it was a combination of Mexico. Again, these are big customers and that was down. Chuck already mentioned Mexico was down 49%. It was a huge chunk of that was in the SP. And then in the U.S., the service providers, that was modestly down, not dramatic at all. Again and that is, again, we had a lot of customers that were up and a lot that were down, so balanced overall. Operator The next question is coming from Pierre Ferragu of Sanford C. Bernstein Company. Q - Pierre Ferragu I was wondering, Kelly and Chuck, if how much we should read in the weak guide you gave us against at least expectations we had on The Street. Is there a change we should expect in your seasonality pattern as you're going to watch more subscription services like natural, like trends of the first quarter that we've seen in the past? Is that something that we should see or we should expect to see changing over time? A - Charles Robbins Yes, I'll make a comment and let Kelly answer the seasonality portion of it. But clearly, the transition to the software and subscription business obviously impacts how to think about guidance going forward. And when you -- when we see particularly large quarters with high growth like we saw this quarter, I think it will have an impact. I'm not sure exactly how we look at what it means seasonally. Kelly? A - Kelly Kramer Yes, I mean, I do think that the models that we've looked at, tried and true over the years, where we could look at normal sequential from Q3 and Q4, I think those models are changing because we're accelerating what is -- we're putting more on the balance sheet than what is amortizing off. While we're part of our revenue guide takes into account the growth of what's coming from our recurring offers, we're still adding so much more because we're adding more and more offers every day. So I do think it is changing a bit. I think we'll talk about this a bit more when we get to our Analyst conference in June as well. But we'll give you clarity of how we can continue to model that. We certainly saw the big chunk of our business that's driven by the core orders in the book and ship, because we still have a lot of our business that we haven't transitioned yet, but as we drive more and more of that, I do think it's going to have to change how we've modeled in the past as an analyst, right? And we'll give you the clarity to help that. Operator Next question is coming from the line of Steve Milunovich of UBS Securities. Q - Steven Milunovich Kelly, can you give us any guidance by product segment for next quarter? For example, Services, I assume, will be up again. So in terms of kind of the deceleration of the downside, where will we see that? Will Switching likely be down, Routing be down more kind of in terms of things getting a bit worse? Where do you think we'll see that? A - Kelly Kramer Yes, I mean, again, Steve, that we -- because so much of our core business is still very much related to the orders that we have yet to book, our backlog accounts were less than 1/3. And so much of our quarter comes from the order yet to come. We don't give guidance by business unit. But directionally, I think you're thinking about it the right way, right? I mean, I think last quarter, we tried to guide, when we were talking about Routing. We knew we had strong orders a quarter ago in Routing which is why it wasn't as bad as it had been in the quarter before this quarter on revenue. So again, it takes into account all of that. I do think, as you know, our Switching business is very fluid, so I don't think you should assume that, that is going to continue to be -- that goes up and down, so I don't think you should draw a trend having that being positive this quarter. So I think it's very fluid within business units. Operator Our next question is coming from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Q - Roderick Hall I just wanted to see if you could comment a little bit on the 31% recurring revenue. Maybe help us understand how much of that is SMARTnet and maintenance-type services and how much is, let's call it, next-gen recurring revenue. And so that -- and I also would like it, if you could comment, I know the carrier situation in the U.S. is pretty weak and we've seen that across other companies as well. But could you comment on specific projects like the Metro Optical buildout? Is that still a bright spot? Do you still see that project moving ahead as expected? A - Kelly Kramer Sure. I'll hit the first one. So yes, if I break out the 31%, so the way to think about it, Rod, is basically, 90% of my services revenue is recurring, okay? So of the 31%, 75% of that dollar amount, so the $3.6 billion -- over $3.6 billion, 75% of that comes from the Services business. On the product side, 10% of my product revenue is now coming from recurring, so that's over $900 million. So 25% of that over $3.6 billion. And so again, I think that Services has continued to be in that 90% range. And again, what we're really trying to drive is more and more of those offers on the product side. A - Charles Robbins Yes and Rod, this is Chuck. Like 6 quarters ago, the product number, I think, was 6%, so we have made progress and we'll continue to, as we see the amount of business that we're putting on the balance sheet is accelerating. On your second question, we absolutely continue to see the projects like Metro Optical moving forward. We've actually continued to do well in some of the next-generation areas that we're working with many of the U.S. service providers. So we see that going well and we do believe that as they make some of these transitions, we're going to be right in the middle of them with them. Operator The next question is coming from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Q - Vijay Bhagavath I mean, Chuck, I'm just a research analyst. I've noticed you're using AI machine learning quite a bit more recently. So like to get your idea, Chuck and also, Kelly, if you could, in terms of which might be the product areas within Cisco where you're apply AI machine learning to the max initially, where you see kind of low-hanging fruit, immediate kind of business outcomes from AI machine learning. Would it be in which parts of the portfolio? A - Charles Robbins Thanks, Vijay. Yes, it's -- your point is actually quite accurate that we look at how we use it -- both of those as tools across our entire portfolio. And I would tell you that there are initiatives underway and there are active solutions already in the marketplace that have elements of that. In our security portfolio, there are absolutely elements of the that, that are in our collaboration portfolio already. We see lots of opportunities when you start talking about automation and analytics and things like network assurance, capabilities or in service provider, self-healing networks. So we see the opportunity across everything we do and we have initiatives both already working with customers as well as a lot of work going on inside the business units to leverage AI machine learning and other technologies going forward. Operator The next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company. Q - Paul Silverstein I'm hoping for a clarification on certain issues. One, going back to the earlier question on pricing. Kelly, did I hear you say that pricing was relatively stable? And can you give us some granularity in terms of what you're seeing in Europe Switching and Routing in terms of pricing? And just very quickly, 2 quarters ago, you quantified the impact of the shift to recurring revenue model. I think you'd cited 100- to 200-plus basis point adverse impact. Can you give us quantification of that impact this quarter? A - Kelly Kramer Sure. So on the pricing, yes, just to give you the clarification of the pricing and I'll pull up actually between Europe here, so just give me a second. But so to clarify, so we do have normal price erosion every period for, mostly, in our switching and routing portfolio, those are the ones that are most sensitive to it. It's been in the same consistent percentage in terms of price reduction year-over-year that it has been both last quarter, a year ago and so in the last -- we had one favorable quarter where we had some favorability for some rebates, but overall, it's been in the same range. But it hasn't gotten worse. I'll pull up about -- I'll try to pull up here as I'm answering the second question, any difference between Europe and the Americas. But I think it's fairly consistent across the regions. The second clarification was on -- what was it, Marilyn? A - Charles Robbins On the impact of the recurring business. A - Kelly Kramer Yes. Yes, so I have been saying it's in the 1 to 2 range. It is definitely pushing closer to the 2% range at this point. I mean, I think, it's clearly driven. We share with you the balance and that's accelerating and I certainly look at the short term portion of that and try to quarterize that together with it. But it's definitely -- it's pointing to the 2% more than the 1%. And Paul, I'll get back to you on that -- if there's any difference between Americas and Europe on that. Operator Next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America. Q - Tal Liani If my numbers are correct, your recurring revenues grew 6% year-over-year and it was 14% the previous quarters. And I'm trying to see what could cause reacceleration. The question I have is whether you focus the recurring part mostly on new types of businesses, such as security and others or you can find ways to go back to Switching and Routing and change either pricing scheme or add features or do something such that recurring revenues outside of maintenance, of course, recurring revenues grow and you can add software features on top will do that. The question is whether the customers will accept it or is this is going to be a traditional business model forever? A - Charles Robbins Yes, Tal, thanks for the question. So even in our current deferred revenue from Software and Subscription, there are elements of our core portfolio that are included in that $4.4 billion that you saw primarily through our Cisco ONE offerings that we put together. Probably 18 months ago, we started that journey and we got those offers and they began to ramp. But we also are looking -- obviously, security is ramping. Collaboration has been the one probably the longest in this model. But we do believe that across the portfolio, with future offers, we have the opportunity to do that and you'll see that as we deliver on some of the new capabilities. Kelly, any commentary on the... A - Kelly Kramer Yes, on the slowdown, so Tal, we're actually not slowing down. The reason it looks like it's slowing down is for the Services piece, we do have the extra week compare. So if you adjust for that, it's up double digits in total. And if I look at just product, the growth of product which I said is over $900 million, that's growing 34% year-over-year and it was 30% last quarter. So that continues to grow faster. A - Marilyn Mora I believe that was our last question. Chuck, maybe I'll turn it to you for over for final words. End of Q&A Charles Robbins Yes, so first of all, I want to thank all of you for joining the call today. I wanted to just take a minute and reiterate that I believe that our strategy is working and I'm really -- I'm optimistic about where we're going to go over the next 3 to 5 years. We set out 18 months ago to transition the business to one of more software and subscription. At the time, 8 quarters ago, it was $2 billion on our balance sheet. Today, we've more than doubled that, up 57% this quarter to $4.4 billion and accelerating. So I believe that is working and we'll continue to shift more and more of our offers into that space. We also, obviously, wanted to be very clear about the areas that we needed to invest in and you've seen significant investments in security and collaboration over the years.  About 15 months ago, we made obvious reallocations of expenses more towards the core and you're going to see future innovation in that space as well. Our customers really are going to be adding billions of connections in the future and they are going to need a next-generation network with security automation and analytics. And so we're transitioning the business model. We're transitioning the network offers that we're going to deliver to our customers as they move into this next generation. And at the same time, we're leveraging our capability to do inorganic as well as organic innovation to make that happen. And in the midst of all this change, we remain very committed to our execution model and ensuring that we're focused on profitability as well as capital returns to our shareholders. So that's a summary of where I think we're right now and I wanted to thank all of you for spending time with us today. Thanks. Marilyn Mora Thanks, Chuck and I'll go ahead and close it up here. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call which will reflect our fiscal 2017 fourth quarter and annual results, will be on Wednesday, August 16, 2017, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern time.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator Q - Mark Moskowitz I wanted to see if we could understand more of the guidance, Kelly and Chuck. The revenues are little lighter than we had anticipated. Is that a function of macro factors? Or is that a function more of the shift to the subscription model or maybe there's going to be some disturbance here and there. Clearly, the deferred revenue -- product revenue growth is quite nice, but I was just wondering if there's any sort of puts and takes you could walk us through there. I really appreciate it. A - Charles Robbins Kelly, why don't you take him through the bridge and then I'll just make some comments? A - Kelly Kramer Sure. So Mark, when we look at guidance, it's a combination of many factors, right? It starts with our backlog and then orders on them, the funnel. And then yes, definitely, we take into account our transition to more software and subscriptions and how that's impacting it. So when I look at the guidance we just gave, our orders were a little weaker in Q3 which does mean that I'm starting with the lower backlog than anticipated. And then when I'm assuming, when I look at the order strength, we're assuming what we saw in Q3 continues on in Q4. So just to give some color around that. Where we had -- we have been facing headwinds all quarter long with SP and emerging. We saw them get worse this quarter that you saw in the numbers there. I'm expecting that to continue. And then we saw some new kind of macro issues in the areas like Public Sector and the U.S. Fed space and things like that. So I'm assuming that orders in line that we saw in Q3 is going to continue on in Q4. And then finally, we're seeing an impact because you're seeing it go to the balance sheet of this transition that we're just accelerating through to the tune of 1.5 to 2 points. So the combination of those 3 things are driving the guidance into that minus-4 to minus-6 range. A - Charles Robbins Yes, just -- Mark, a couple of comments on what Kelly just described. I mean, the Public Sector business, particularly in the United States, the federal business is, frankly, it's about 1 point of that guide. It's a pretty significant stall right now with the lack of budget visibility. And when you think about the strategy that we're deploying, the 57% growth in the software and subscription business, if you just go back 8 quarters ago, we had $2 billion on our balance sheet relative to software and subscription. And the first 2 or 3 quarters, we were convincing the teams that, that was the shift we were going to make. And now we have more than doubled that to $4.4 billion and the growth there is accelerating. So we're very pleased with that transition. And at the same time we deal with all of these challenges, we're also, -- we remain very committed to earnings. We remain very committed to our capital return strategy. Operator The next question is coming from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Q - Ittai Kidron Chuck, I'm going to take a U-turn this time, actually not ask you about the data center business but rather focus a little bit more on the gross margins. Some of the commentary in your press release talked about some pricing pressures. If you could give us a little bit more color on the guidance and your gross margin assumption into the guidance, how much of that is mix-related and how much of that is pricing? And if -- any color you could give on the pricing, how much is competitive versus, I don't know, product shifts or something like that, that'll be great. A - Charles Robbins Thanks, Ittai. So Kelly, let's have the same strategy. You want to go through the math on this and then... A - Kelly Kramer So Ittai, when we look at the drivers of our growth margin, price in Q3 actually has been in the same range that it was pretty much last year as well as last quarter in terms of the price index that we're seeing. So that's in the same range. Again, it's high, but it's in the range. It's not increasing. I would say in terms of the guidance for Q4, we're assuming that. We're also making sure the teams are being very aggressive where they need to be aggressive in areas and then against competitors where we need to be. But overall, the pricing hasn't changed dramatically besides the normal erosion that we see in churned business lines. I'd say, in terms of mix, that hasn't dramatically changed as well, with switching being positive this quarter, that helped a lot. And again, well, the mix isn't changing. There's mix changes with MBEs in the guidance going forward but it's nothing dramatic. So I'd say we feel good about being able to continue driving the margins that we have. The only other piece I'll comment on, because we mentioned it before, we're still seeing some cost pressure from the increase in DRAM pricing that was got baked in both our Q3 as well as into Q4. But we've been doing a lot of work and our supply chain team has done working with our suppliers to make sure we can secure our forward supply at prices that we can plan on. So I think we've pretty much got that boxed in for the guidance. Operator Next question is coming from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Q - James Faucette Just a couple of quick follow-up questions to some of the comments that have already been made. Can you talk a little bit about the orders and you mentioned that fed was weak. But when you look at the other areas of weakness, can you talk about, like, what's driving those, et cetera? And I guess, more long term, it continues to be a good deferred revenue growth and you mentioned the security. What are the priorities that your customers are showing in the security space generally? And what are you able to address now versus where are the things that they're asking for that you think you need to improve on? A - Charles Robbins Great. Thanks, James. And so we have some order color and then securities. So let me take the order stuff and then, Kelly, chime in as you'd like. So if we just go around -- sort of go around the globe, let me just highlight what we saw. And I'm just going to tell you what drove the weakness in these areas so you can assume the other pieces of the business were pretty much as expected. In the Americas, it was primarily the U.S. federal -- I mean, there's so much uncertainty around budgets. The U.S. federal business was a significant driver. Mexico, there has been a lot of uncertainty in Mexico and that was actually down 49% for us year-over-year. So it was -- there's a great deal of uncertainty around the investment landscape there. And then the third element would have been the Service Provider business in the Americas. So those were the things that really drove the orders in the U.S. In Europe, the U.K., the currency issue in the U.K. is real and was very impactful in that business. And then we continue to see pressure in the Middle East relative to oil prices. We also -- obviously, there's been a lot of uncertainty around the geopolitical dynamics, some of which have been clarified recently, obviously. And we did see some strength in some countries there, but the U.K. is a big country for us. And the Middle East, obviously, with the uncertainty around oil prices, continues to be a little bit of a pressure as well. In APJC, we saw Japan and Australia were reasonable. India was solid again. And China, we had tough comps from the SP Video business from a year ago that we talked about. So that's really what we saw from an orders perspective. I think if you look at customer segments, just to give you some color, Enterprise, the challenge was largely driven by Europe. Commercial, the lightness there was driven by Europe. Public Sector, as I said, was U.S. Federal and SP was fairly consistent. So Kelly, any other comments on that? A - Kelly Kramer Yes. A - Charles Robbins Just quickly on the securities, since you snuck that one in, too, James. The -- what our customers -- what we see happening in security right now is that as our customers prepare for the next few years and literally adding billions of new connections, we obviously believe that the network is going to become even more relevant than it ever has been. And our customers are going to need -- to deal with that scale, they're going to need significant automation. They're going to need greater insights coming out of their technology infrastructure like the network through analytics. They're going to need security embedded at the network layer because you're going to have to begin to secure the infrastructure the minute these packets hit the wire. So what they're looking for is -- they are looking for an end-to-end architecture now for dealing with security. They're looking for an open architecture that actually allows them to buy the best-of-breed technology which we have across many elements of what they're trying to do. But they are looking for an architecture and they're looking for -- to leverage as much of that from the cloud and which correspondingly turns into the subscription business, as you pointed out. So that's what we see happening there. There's obviously lots of other areas within that architecture that we don't play today where we could and we continue to assess all of those opportunities. Operator The next question is coming from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. The next question on queue, coming from Simon Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Q - Simona Jankowski It's Simona Jankowski. Just a couple of follow-ups. First, if you can clarify in terms of the weakness you saw incrementally in the Service Provider and emerging market theaters. How much of that was related to competition or pricing pressure such as from Huawei versus some of the macro factors you discussed? And then just a quick follow-up on how did your cloud business do this quarter. A - Charles Robbins So let me comment on the first one and then, Kelly, maybe you can talk about the cloud business and how we -- I'll talk about both of them but then how we measure that specifically. So the weakness in emerging and SP, I would say, in emerging, I would say it's less. We clearly -- we've been -- we've had competition from several vendors. And clearly, Huawei is a very strong competitor. I don't feel like it has increased significantly in the emerging countries. It's been pretty consistent there and our teams know how to compete and we continue to evolve our strategy and bring different tools to help them compete. So I don't -- I wouldn't say that had much to do with it. I think on our overarching cloud business, Simona, we look at that in many, many different ways. So we look at, obviously, our private cloud business which is made up of the UCS business as well as our data center switching portfolio which we talked about earlier. Both of those, the UCS business was down 5, as you saw. And then the -- obviously, our next-generation switching portfolio continues to do well, the ACI elements up 42%. And if you're asking about the MSDC guys which are the web scale cloud guys, it's the same as we were last quarter. These -- we have -- we're engaging with them on an individual basis. We look at the big ones as, frankly, markets of one. We have made great progress with a few of them. Others we're in the early stages and we have codevelopment opportunities. But I would tell you, we're in very deep discussions with most all of them and we're looking at very strategic partnerships that scale beyond even just selling infrastructure to them in many cases. So I'm not sure where you're going with cloud. Hopefully one of those answers cover what you're looking for. Operator Next question on queue is coming from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. You may now begin. Your next on queue is coming from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse Securities. Your line is open, you may now begin. Q - Kulbinder Garcha For Chuck maybe. On the revenue side, I take your points on the macro economy and the weakness in emerging markets. A - Charles Robbins Kulbinder, could you just speak up just a hair, buddy? Q - Kulbinder Garcha My question is on revenue growth, I think the drivers of the weak guidance you're talking about. I guess, the broader question is how important is getting this company back to growth? It looks like last year, you did grow. This year, you're probably not going to grow very much, i.e. especially organically. So is there something more transformative have to happen on the M&A front? Do you think this is temporary in nature? I know you're having this headwind of this business transformation, but just the importance of revenue growth to Cisco as a company, if you could comment on that for the long term. A - Charles Robbins Yes, Kulbinder, I think that -- when we look to the future right now and you really think about the number of new connections that are going to be added, that our customers will be adding over the coming years and the need for automation, the need for analytics and security, what we have done and it'll be done -- our solutions that we'll bringing in the space with a combination, to your point, of inorganic capabilities, as we have shown our ability to do, as well as some organic innovation. I've talked to several of you over the last few quarters about the fact that we went in and reallocated a fair amount of our R&D expense last year and over last 18 months.  And many of those solutions are targeting these next-generation networks that our customers are going to need to build out to support this new infrastructure. And with a high degree of automation across the network, with a high degree of analytics, with distributed compute capabilities for processing the data at the Edge as well as the security piece. So we have future innovation that will come in that space. We'll also use a combination of inorganic options where we need it. And we believe that as we get into the next generation of the networks that the customers need to build out, that we will be very successful with our capabilities. Operator The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo, you may now begin. Q - Jess Lubert I was hoping you could provide a little more detail regarding the order weakness you're flagging in the North American service provider vertical. Last quarter, if I remember correctly, you suggested orders there were improving a little bit. So I just want to understand the change. To what degree it's a technology issue versus a macro issue, the duration, you think, that's likely to be weak for and if there's if any areas within the vertical that are better or worse, that would be helpful. A - Charles Robbins Let me just give you a couple of comments and then Kelly can give us any specifics. As I said 2 quarters back, I think, when we had the negative 10% growth or 12% or whatever it was, 12%, I think. A - Kelly Kramer Yes, [indiscernible]. A - Charles Robbins This -- Our entire SP business around the world is driven by very large customers. And so when some number of them have an off quarter, it can affect the business. And I think the Americas would be probably an example of that this quarter as well. And the Mexico business that I discussed is heavily influenced by service providers. And so that's a bit of what we've seen. We had some customers in the U.S. that were performed very well this quarter for us and others that did not. Kelly, any comment on the numbers? A - Kelly Kramer Yes. No, I'd say, I think you hit on it. I think with the Americas being down so much, it was a combination of Mexico. Again, these are big customers and that was down. Chuck already mentioned Mexico was down 49%. It was a huge chunk of that was in the SP. And then in the U.S., the service providers, that was modestly down, not dramatic at all. Again and that is, again, we had a lot of customers that were up and a lot that were down, so balanced overall. Operator The next question is coming from Pierre Ferragu of Sanford C. Bernstein Company. Q - Pierre Ferragu I was wondering, Kelly and Chuck, if how much we should read in the weak guide you gave us against at least expectations we had on The Street. Is there a change we should expect in your seasonality pattern as you're going to watch more subscription services like natural, like trends of the first quarter that we've seen in the past? Is that something that we should see or we should expect to see changing over time? A - Charles Robbins Yes, I'll make a comment and let Kelly answer the seasonality portion of it. But clearly, the transition to the software and subscription business obviously impacts how to think about guidance going forward. And when you -- when we see particularly large quarters with high growth like we saw this quarter, I think it will have an impact. I'm not sure exactly how we look at what it means seasonally. Kelly? A - Kelly Kramer Yes, I mean, I do think that the models that we've looked at, tried and true over the years, where we could look at normal sequential from Q3 and Q4, I think those models are changing because we're accelerating what is -- we're putting more on the balance sheet than what is amortizing off. While we're part of our revenue guide takes into account the growth of what's coming from our recurring offers, we're still adding so much more because we're adding more and more offers every day. So I do think it is changing a bit. I think we'll talk about this a bit more when we get to our Analyst conference in June as well. But we'll give you clarity of how we can continue to model that. We certainly saw the big chunk of our business that's driven by the core orders in the book and ship, because we still have a lot of our business that we haven't transitioned yet, but as we drive more and more of that, I do think it's going to have to change how we've modeled in the past as an analyst, right? And we'll give you the clarity to help that. Operator Next question is coming from the line of Steve Milunovich of UBS Securities. Q - Steven Milunovich Kelly, can you give us any guidance by product segment for next quarter? For example, Services, I assume, will be up again. So in terms of kind of the deceleration of the downside, where will we see that? Will Switching likely be down, Routing be down more kind of in terms of things getting a bit worse? Where do you think we'll see that? A - Kelly Kramer Yes, I mean, again, Steve, that we -- because so much of our core business is still very much related to the orders that we have yet to book, our backlog accounts were less than 1/3. And so much of our quarter comes from the order yet to come. We don't give guidance by business unit. But directionally, I think you're thinking about it the right way, right? I mean, I think last quarter, we tried to guide, when we were talking about Routing. We knew we had strong orders a quarter ago in Routing which is why it wasn't as bad as it had been in the quarter before this quarter on revenue. So again, it takes into account all of that. I do think, as you know, our Switching business is very fluid, so I don't think you should assume that, that is going to continue to be -- that goes up and down, so I don't think you should draw a trend having that being positive this quarter. So I think it's very fluid within business units. Operator Our next question is coming from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Q - Roderick Hall I just wanted to see if you could comment a little bit on the 31% recurring revenue. Maybe help us understand how much of that is SMARTnet and maintenance-type services and how much is, let's call it, next-gen recurring revenue. And so that -- and I also would like it, if you could comment, I know the carrier situation in the U.S. is pretty weak and we've seen that across other companies as well. But could you comment on specific projects like the Metro Optical buildout? Is that still a bright spot? Do you still see that project moving ahead as expected? A - Kelly Kramer Sure. I'll hit the first one. So yes, if I break out the 31%, so the way to think about it, Rod, is basically, 90% of my services revenue is recurring, okay? So of the 31%, 75% of that dollar amount, so the $3.6 billion -- over $3.6 billion, 75% of that comes from the Services business. On the product side, 10% of my product revenue is now coming from recurring, so that's over $900 million. So 25% of that over $3.6 billion. And so again, I think that Services has continued to be in that 90% range. And again, what we're really trying to drive is more and more of those offers on the product side. A - Charles Robbins Yes and Rod, this is Chuck. Like 6 quarters ago, the product number, I think, was 6%, so we have made progress and we'll continue to, as we see the amount of business that we're putting on the balance sheet is accelerating. On your second question, we absolutely continue to see the projects like Metro Optical moving forward. We've actually continued to do well in some of the next-generation areas that we're working with many of the U.S. service providers. So we see that going well and we do believe that as they make some of these transitions, we're going to be right in the middle of them with them. Operator The next question is coming from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Q - Vijay Bhagavath I mean, Chuck, I'm just a research analyst. I've noticed you're using AI machine learning quite a bit more recently. So like to get your idea, Chuck and also, Kelly, if you could, in terms of which might be the product areas within Cisco where you're apply AI machine learning to the max initially, where you see kind of low-hanging fruit, immediate kind of business outcomes from AI machine learning. Would it be in which parts of the portfolio? A - Charles Robbins Thanks, Vijay. Yes, it's -- your point is actually quite accurate that we look at how we use it -- both of those as tools across our entire portfolio. And I would tell you that there are initiatives underway and there are active solutions already in the marketplace that have elements of that. In our security portfolio, there are absolutely elements of the that, that are in our collaboration portfolio already. We see lots of opportunities when you start talking about automation and analytics and things like network assurance, capabilities or in service provider, self-healing networks. So we see the opportunity across everything we do and we have initiatives both already working with customers as well as a lot of work going on inside the business units to leverage AI machine learning and other technologies going forward. Operator The next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company. Q - Paul Silverstein I'm hoping for a clarification on certain issues. One, going back to the earlier question on pricing. Kelly, did I hear you say that pricing was relatively stable? And can you give us some granularity in terms of what you're seeing in Europe Switching and Routing in terms of pricing? And just very quickly, 2 quarters ago, you quantified the impact of the shift to recurring revenue model. I think you'd cited 100- to 200-plus basis point adverse impact. Can you give us quantification of that impact this quarter? A - Kelly Kramer Sure. So on the pricing, yes, just to give you the clarification of the pricing and I'll pull up actually between Europe here, so just give me a second. But so to clarify, so we do have normal price erosion every period for, mostly, in our switching and routing portfolio, those are the ones that are most sensitive to it. It's been in the same consistent percentage in terms of price reduction year-over-year that it has been both last quarter, a year ago and so in the last -- we had one favorable quarter where we had some favorability for some rebates, but overall, it's been in the same range. But it hasn't gotten worse. I'll pull up about -- I'll try to pull up here as I'm answering the second question, any difference between Europe and the Americas. But I think it's fairly consistent across the regions. The second clarification was on -- what was it, Marilyn? A - Charles Robbins On the impact of the recurring business. A - Kelly Kramer Yes. Yes, so I have been saying it's in the 1 to 2 range. It is definitely pushing closer to the 2% range at this point. I mean, I think, it's clearly driven. We share with you the balance and that's accelerating and I certainly look at the short term portion of that and try to quarterize that together with it. But it's definitely -- it's pointing to the 2% more than the 1%. And Paul, I'll get back to you on that -- if there's any difference between Americas and Europe on that. Operator Next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America. Q - Tal Liani If my numbers are correct, your recurring revenues grew 6% year-over-year and it was 14% the previous quarters. And I'm trying to see what could cause reacceleration. The question I have is whether you focus the recurring part mostly on new types of businesses, such as security and others or you can find ways to go back to Switching and Routing and change either pricing scheme or add features or do something such that recurring revenues outside of maintenance, of course, recurring revenues grow and you can add software features on top will do that. The question is whether the customers will accept it or is this is going to be a traditional business model forever? A - Charles Robbins Yes, Tal, thanks for the question. So even in our current deferred revenue from Software and Subscription, there are elements of our core portfolio that are included in that $4.4 billion that you saw primarily through our Cisco ONE offerings that we put together. Probably 18 months ago, we started that journey and we got those offers and they began to ramp. But we also are looking -- obviously, security is ramping. Collaboration has been the one probably the longest in this model. But we do believe that across the portfolio, with future offers, we have the opportunity to do that and you'll see that as we deliver on some of the new capabilities. Kelly, any commentary on the... A - Kelly Kramer Yes, on the slowdown, so Tal, we're actually not slowing down. The reason it looks like it's slowing down is for the Services piece, we do have the extra week compare. So if you adjust for that, it's up double digits in total. And if I look at just product, the growth of product which I said is over $900 million, that's growing 34% year-over-year and it was 30% last quarter. So that continues to grow faster. A - Marilyn Mora I believe that was our last question. Chuck, maybe I'll turn it to you for over for final words. End of Q&A Charles Robbins Yes, so first of all, I want to thank all of you for joining the call today. I wanted to just take a minute and reiterate that I believe that our strategy is working and I'm really -- I'm optimistic about where we're going to go over the next 3 to 5 years. We set out 18 months ago to transition the business to one of more software and subscription. At the time, 8 quarters ago, it was $2 billion on our balance sheet. Today, we've more than doubled that, up 57% this quarter to $4.4 billion and accelerating. So I believe that is working and we'll continue to shift more and more of our offers into that space. We also, obviously, wanted to be very clear about the areas that we needed to invest in and you've seen significant investments in security and collaboration over the years.  About 15 months ago, we made obvious reallocations of expenses more towards the core and you're going to see future innovation in that space as well. Our customers really are going to be adding billions of connections in the future and they are going to need a next-generation network with security automation and analytics. And so we're transitioning the business model. We're transitioning the network offers that we're going to deliver to our customers as they move into this next generation. And at the same time, we're leveraging our capability to do inorganic as well as organic innovation to make that happen. And in the midst of all this change, we remain very committed to our execution model and ensuring that we're focused on profitability as well as capital returns to our shareholders. So that's a summary of where I think we're right now and I wanted to thank all of you for spending time with us today. Thanks. Marilyn Mora Thanks, Chuck and I'll go ahead and close it up here. Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call which will reflect our fiscal 2017 fourth quarter and annual results, will be on Wednesday, August 16, 2017, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern time.

(NASDAQ: DELL ) F1Q14 Earnings Conference Call May 16, 2013 4:45 pm ET Executives Robert Williams  Head of Investor Relations Brian T. Gladden  Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Tom Sweet  Corporate Controller Analysts Katy Huberty  Morgan Stanley Toni Sacconaghi  Sanford Bernstein Brian Alexander  Raymond James Maynard Um  Wells Fargo Shannon Cross  Cross Research Steve Milunovich  UBS Kulbinder Garcha  Credit Suisse Chris Whitmore  Deutsche Bank Keith Bachman  Bank of Montreal Ananda Baruah  Brean Capital Aaron Rakers  Stifel Nicolaus Bill Shope  Goldman Sachs Stephen Patel  ISI Group Operator Good afternoon, and welcome to the Dell Inc., First Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Id like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Dell. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Inc. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or part without the prior written permission of Dell Inc. is prohibited. As a reminder, Dell is also simulcasting this presentation with slides at www.dell.com/investor. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Id like to turn the call over to Rob Williams, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Williams, you may begin. Robert Williams Thanks, McKinsey. With me today are Brian Gladden and Tom Sweet. The web deck is posted to our website in advance of the call and I encourage you to review this and the related materials for additional prospective. Next, Id also like to remind you that all statements that are made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings and in the cautionary statement in our press release and web deck. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Note that we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and earnings per share. Historical non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the web deck posted in the Investor Relations section at dell.com and in our press release, and 8-K filed today. I encourage you to review these documents. Please also note that unless otherwise mentioned, all growth percentages refer to year-over-year progress. Consistent with last quarter, we will not take any questions on the pending transaction to take the company private. Now, Ill turn it over to Brian. Brian T. Gladden Thanks Rob. As we head into the new fiscal year, we continue to execute our strategy to be the leading provider of end-to-end scalable solutions. Our strategy is differentiated based on our focus on practical innovation, efficient and affordable solutions and our superior customer relationship model. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we delivered revenue of $14.1 billion, down 2%. The enterprise solutions,   services and software business was up 12% to $5.5 billion. Our continued focus on our customers and our ability to meet their needs with differentiated solutions is evident in numerous customer wins that Tom will highlight in the segment section later. Over the past few years, weve acquired many new capabilities in areas like scalable storage solutions, application migration and software. We continue to invest in strategic capabilities additionally, and less than two weeks ago, we announced and closed the acquisition of Enstratius, which improves our end-to-end solutions capabilities by enabling our customers to more effectively manage and integrate their Cloud environments. Ill refer to non-GAAP financial measures going forward. Gross margin was $2.9 billion at 20.6% of revenue, which was down 40 basis points sequentially when adjusting for last quarters vendor settlements. We continue to face the competitive pricing environment and have aligned our pricing strategy to invest in growth ahead of plan reductions in our cost structure and this has affected our profitability. We remain focused on pursuing strategic revenue opportunities that will drive long-term profitability and cash flow. SG&A increased 4% and as a percentage of revenue increased 20 basis points sequentially to 14.2%. R&D spending increased 33% and as a percent of revenue increased 10 basis points sequentially to 2.2%. Of note, there were almost $90 million in expenses related to the pending go-private transactions that were excluded from our non-GAAP results. Operating income was $590 million or 4.2% of revenue. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 28.7% is driven by a greater portion of our business in higher tax jurisdictions during the quarter. Earnings per share were $0.21 declining 51%. Cash used in operations in the quarter was $39 million as the first quarter is typically a seasonal low for cash flow. On a trailing 12 month basis, cash flow from operations was $3.4 billion down 31%. Our cash and investments balance ended at $13.2 billion as we repaid approximately $2 billion in debt during the quarter. Now let me turn to our operating segment results. As we announced in February, this is the first quarter were reporting results under the new segment structure. Weve aligned our operating segments to our end-to-end solutions portfolio in the Enterprise Solutions Group, Dell Services, Dell Software and End User Computing Group. Enterprise Solutions Group and the End User Computing Group receive revenue from Dell Services to align our reporting structure and drive accountability in each of the respective operating segments. As a result, with some of our operating segment revenue will not equal our consolidated non-GAAP results. In addition, there are unallocated costs that remain at a corporate level that our reconciling items between the total segment and consolidated operating income. The reconciliation of all these items to our consolidated results can be found in the tables that are available on the Dell Investor Relations website. Now, let me turn it over to Tom Sweet, who will take you through our new business segment results. Tom Sweet Thanks, Brian. Let me take you through the financial results for each segment and I will also share a few important customer wins. Lets start with the Enterprise Solutions Group or ESG. This business includes servers, networking, storage and ESG-related peripherals. We continue to see strong growth in ESG of 10% and revenue of $3.1 billion and operating income of $136 million or 4.4% of revenue. Within ESG, our server, networking and enterprise peripheral business delivered revenue of $2.7 billion, which equates to 14% growth. This was driven by strong growth in our hyper-scale data center servers. In this space Dell Servers power four of the top five search engines and 75% of the top social media sites worldwide. Our networking business increased 24% on strong Force10 results. This represents the ninth straight quarter of both year-over-year and sequential growth in this business. Dell storage revenue was down 10% to $424 million. Were focused on continuing to more effectively position the right solutions based on customer needs and optimizing our selling motion to improve revenue momentum. While we have made progress, we have more work to do in this area. The ESG market is rapidly changing and migrating to converged solutions that blur the lines between traditional product sets. A great example of this was a win with Statoil Norway as our global capabilities in converged solutions displays legacy vendors in each of the traditional product sets. We are now rolling out a solution that includes Dell branded servers, storage and networking for their new data centers in over 70 locations worldwide. The services business includes a broad range of IT and business services including support and deployment services, infrastructure, cloud, security services, applications and business process services. This business was up 2% to $2.1 billion. OpEx for this business increased to $317 million or 17.6% of revenue, up from 16.3% of revenue in the first quarter of last year. We have been reshaping this portfolio to focus on more profitable solutions that are aligned to our strategic capabilities and we continue to improve our cost structure. Within services, support and deployment increased 2% with revenue of $1.2 billion. Enhanced and new solutions such as Pro Support Plus are adding capabilities to our portfolio that focus on proactively improving the performance and stability of critical systems by leveraging our expertise and deep understanding of the customers IT environment. These solutions and strong attach rates have resulted in revenue streams, partially mitigating the downward pressure caused by the decline in EUC hardware sales. Infrastructure, cloud, and security services were up 11% to $612 million which includes an increase of 20% in our security business. Security continues to be one of the top concerns of our customers and we have continued to develop and deliver new and innovative solutions to accommodate the constantly changing threats. We had a 15% decline in our apps and BPO business driven by a divestiture and select contract expirations as we continue working to improve the profitability of this business. Our services capabilities combined with our vertical expertise continue to position us well to address the needs of our customers. A great example of this was a win with the UK-based Locala community partnership, a social enterprise that delivers community healthcare to over 400,000 people. Our solution focus on improving the management of patient records and simplifying their IT environment by delivering customized services, hardware and software through a cloud-based solution. Our software business includes systems management, security software solutions and information management. This business delivered revenue of $295 million in an operating loss of $85 million for the quarter. Consistent with our prior communication and business plan, we remain confident that the Quest acquisition will be accretive in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 as we invest to grow the business. We are enhancing our software capabilities and increasing our investment in this business with additional sales capacity in R&D. Software is a glue for many of our end-to-end solutions and it will play an increasingly important role in our competitive differentiation. Our End-User Computing businesses or EUC includes desktops including thin clients, notebooks including tablets, third-party software and client related peripherals. This business delivered revenue of $8.9 billion, down 9%. Operating income of $224 million was down 65% at 2.5% of revenue. As we discussed last quarter, we are investing and acquiring new customer accounts that will benefit our long-term profitability and cash flow. We continue to expect relatively weak demand in this business and continued market competitiveness. These dynamics reinforce the importance of our cost out initiatives for EUC, where we are targeting greater than $1 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2015. In addition, during the quarter, we increased our investment to improve sales coverage for key areas of the business. The desktop and thin-client business revenue was $3.3 billion, down 2%. The trajectory of the desktop business continues to improve as we maintain a strong position in the traditional desktop space and are seeing good traction with new desktop form factor such as our innovative all-in-one designs. Mobility revenue of $3.6 billion was down 16% as demand in the space continues to be pressured by customers diverting spending to alternative mobile solutions. We are encouraged by the industry-based enhancements coming to the notebook touch ecosystem and we will bring new and innovative solutions to the market to enhance our position in this space. We are seeing a good ramp in our tablet based solutions led by our Latitude 10 business focus tablet. Our third-party software in EUC peripherals delivered revenue of $2 billion, down 6%. A great example of our ability to deliver differentiated solutions to our customers is a recently awarded $60 million client refresh with Marsh & McLennan. We were able to offer a broad array of EUC solution between our Latitude notebooks, OptiPlex desktops as well as precision workstations and XPS systems for higher end-users. Our warranty, product quality, value and partnership were all key points of differentiation. We will be rolling out these solutions to 55,000 end users globally displacing a key competitor that was a long time incumbent. Before I turn it back to Rob, I want to remind everyone that consistent with last quarter, given our pending merger agreement, we will not be providing an outlook. Now I will turn it back to Rob to be in Q&A. Robert Williams Thanks, Tom. Please limit your questions to one with no follow-ups. McKinsey, can we have the first question? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of todays call. (Operator Instructions) Well take our first question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty  Morgan Stanley Hi thanks, good afternoon. Given the significant change in profitability, can you just take a step back and talk about whether the margin deterioration this quarter is what you expected when you rolled out a more aggressive pricing strategy and if it was what you expected? Can you just go into a more detail around what it is, youre trying to accomplish, given that segment operating income dollars were almost cut in half and it doesnt drive top line growth? Thanks. Brian T. Gladden Yeah, Katy, I would say weve been talking about this for a couple of quarters about our need to adjust pricing. We did that. You saw some of that last quarter, it was affected by the settlements that we had as well and it wasnt quite as apparent in the P&L. But clearly weve been focused on this for a while. I think there are parts of the business where we are beginning to see some elasticity. Demand has been I would say weaker than we expected as we headed into the year. And I think the reality is in many cases these are accounts that were gaining that we feel very good about the long-term profitability and the impact on our cash flow over time. So while we may not see that showing up there is a positive in the P&L in the short-term, we think for the long-term its the right thing to do to get ourselves back in price position to scale the business. And I think as you look at the share dynamics that played out in the first quarter, we actually did improve our position on a share basis in a market thats pretty tough. So really conscious effort to position the business and something weve been working on for a few quarters now. Operator Well take our next question from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi  Sanford Bernstein Hi, yes thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on that. Is there a minimum acceptable level of profitability in the end-user computing group that you are willing to just staying on an ongoing basis in your effort to hold or gain share. And related to that, you talked about making investments in advance to your cost cutting. I think a year ago at your Analyst Day, you talked about this cost cutting. Given that youve started to be more price aggressive, why have you not been able to undertake any of this cost cutting to date, whats holding you back and wouldnt it make a lot more sense to be doing the cost cutting and more aggressive pricing concurrently? Brian T. Gladden Yeah, Toni, that wouldnt  without providing the details of the specific initiatives, I wouldnt say we havent executed on the cost initiatives. I think we have continued to take cost out of the business. We are just choosing consciously to reinvest those dollars in sales resources and R&D resources in the software business, things that weve talked about over time being important to the future of the company. So I think those things are going on concurrently and in this time right now, we have chosen to reinvest those savings that were driving as part of that initiative and important investments for the future of the company. Thats just what weve decided to do. In terms of profitability, I assume youre talking about the EUC business. Look, I think were not managing that business for one quarter at a time and I think there is a network effect to the impact of what we do there and the scale of that business and the customer relationships that we gain. We are clearly focused on cost in that business in this environment. We have been focused on gaining and improving the growth of that business and gaining share. Weve been able to do that. And as we execute on cost and continue to execute the strategy there, we are confident that will be an important part of the portfolio but not focused on a 90-day target relative to the profitability of that business. Operator We will take our next question from Brian Alexander with Raymond James. Brian Alexander  Raymond James Thanks. I guess following up on pricing, Brian, maybe just talk about why Dell has embraced such an abrupt change in pricing strategy in the client business in the last two quarters. Whats really caused such a sharp change in managements thinking? And related to that, how much of this is self inflicted to retain customers during this period of uncertainty and how much of this would you say is market driven. Brian T. Gladden I think its hard to separate this two, Brian. As you think about how market dynamics play out, clearly there are parts of the business, segments of the business where we are being more aggressive and we recognize that places where we have a strong foothold or historically have had a strong foothold can ultimately build on those relationships and benefit the entire portfolio of solutions. Those are places where clearly wed like to be a bit more aggressive and have over the last couple of quarters. I wouldnt say this has been a abrupt change clearly recognizing as demand weakened over the course of the last year. Weve recognized the need to stop shrinking at a rate faster than the market and weve made those adjustments over the course of a few different quarters here and have seen the impact of that. Improve in terms of growth rates and at the same time, impact short-term profitability for sure. Operator Well take our next question from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Maynard Um  Wells Fargo Hi thank you. Can you talk about your customer engagements and how those discussions are going in light of everything thats happening? How much of your time is being spend explaining kind of whats happening and are customers showing any indication of potentially holding out or lengthened sales cycles just to wait and see what happens. Thanks. Brian T. Gladden Yeah Maynard, I think in general the customer base has been very supportive of the company and long-term relationships, the quality of our solutions, the new solutions we are adding to the portfolio have really carried those relationships and not to say there arent some areas where weve seen questions and we have had to spend time with customers. Weve looked at it as a chance to spend more time with our customers and to make sure theyre comfortable with the strategy of the company and where we are taking it. And I would say for those conversations that I have been part of, those have been very good conversations that in many cases have resulted in more opportunities for the company. Operator We will take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross  Cross Research Thank you very much. Could you talk more about your increased investment in sales and distribution in key regions and segments? Brian T. Gladden This isnt new Shannon. We have been adding resources in the sales model really over the last couple of years and some of that was adding specialist capability around key technologies that weve been adding to the portfolio and doing that organically, but also many of the acquisitions obviously have brought capability from a commercial standpoint with them. Thats been one primary focus. I think the other is some specific regions and sub-segments to the market where weve got strong capability. And where weve seen good progress in terms of building out and adding sales people, we have not hesitated to add more. And tracking the progress and productivity of those sales resources making sure theyre delivering and bringing new business to the company and really taking advantage of places where we have strength has been the focus. Clearly the acquisition of Quest in the software business has brought significant sales capacity to the company and thats been one big area. And as you know and weve talked about a lot, the mid market is a place where we have focused and added resources as well. Operator Well take our next question from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Steve Milunovich  UBS Thank you. Back to the end-user pricing question, could you give a sense of how much of a strategic change this is because in the proxy materials, one of your consultant suggested shifting from a margin to a margin dollar, more commodity driven strategy and obviously weve seen some of that. Michael Dell has indicated apparently that he is going to kind of endorse that approach and shift. So, on the scale from 0% which is no change to 100%, which is a complete change. Are you kind of tweaking things now or do you feel like this is really taken into the full extent that we are likely to see over time in terms of going after more of a low end strategy? Brian T. Gladden Yeah, look Steve I wouldnt say our strategy has changed really at all. I think tactically weve recognized the need to be competitive. Weve adjusted our pricing appropriately. We are expanding our offerings across the portfolio of really offerings at high price bands or higher value products, mid value products, lower value products to play in key markets around the world as weve done over time. And I think youll continue to see us do that. Its not a  this is not a new strategy. This is not a new business model for us. I would say its adjusting tactics given what the markets doing and really where we need to be in the portfolio. Tom Sweet Yeah, Steve, I would say that  I think its fair to say that when you think about our portfolio of customers, the vast majority of those being commercial customers on a global basis. As weve talked through our and made decisions to increase our focus on those customers, there is acquisition business that you engage in. And as Brian alluded to earlier, you think its absolutely the right thing to do for the long-term. But these are accounts that you have to go out and take it different tax and pricing strategy with them and thats often to provide an entry level into that account. And so I think youre seeing a little bit of that in the P&L. Operator We will take our next question from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Kulbinder Garcha  Credit Suisse Thank you. Brian, a couple of kind of follow-ups and everything is being offered today. One of them is just on the End User Computing side, I take the point managing the business for the next 90 days and thats kind of quite clear. I guess intend to this pursue of new customers, can you speak about where we are in that process. Have you put the investments in sales pricing or otherwise you need to all is that significant more amount of effort to come through thats kind of one question. And the second is just the broad level, given the uncertainty thats going on at Dell over the last few months, I understand the sales cycle may not lengthen, but what financial impact would you say is having on ideal results or and how youre managing the business from a cost perspective? Im trying to understand with the margins youre producing overall, now they are lower. Do we seen for sometime, and some of that market, but some of that I think it has to be down to whats been going on with Dell. So any kind of insight there you can provide would be helpful? Brian T. Gladden Yeah, Ill try to answer the second part first Kulbinder. We havent changed the way were running the business. The strategy for the company has endured and I would say we continue to adapt that strategy given the market conditions and things that we learn as we go. But we have made no changes to the strategy and how were running the company as a result of this process. I think thats clear. And I would say its very difficult to quantify what impact the process that we are going to has had on the results of the company, we did callout incremental costs that we are incurring, the transaction costs that weve excluded from our non-GAAP reporting but clearly there is a chance to spend more time with customers and some level of customer just uncertainty that were working our way through. That said we feel like weve done a good job with that during this period. In terms of the EUC business and where we are positioned and where we are in that, I think that weve made a cautious decision here to improve the competitiveness and specifically the pricing. Weve got a lot of ongoing work around the productivity and cost structure of that business that will continue to allow us to be competitive there. And, I dont think this is something that we think about as an initiative. I think its really how we run the business and quarter-to-quarter manage the market conditions and the demand environment that were in. Tom Sweet I would also offer that acquiring new customers and continuing to build that acquisition pipeline is an ongoing and continual effort. Its just not a one quarter or two quarter effort, you build the acquisition pipeline, you continue to acquire new customers and you migrate those customers up to your business model and your other [laps]. So, I think that process continues. Brian T. Gladden And to some extent, I mean, we over some period of time as we were driving the business had, in some ways lost that ability to do the acquisition investments that we really needed. So, weve had obviously some success there and were getting a lot of very positive feedback from customers as we get back into that part of our business. Operator Well take our next question from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank. Chris Whitmore  Deutsche Bank Thanks very much. Brian, I wanted ask about servers and whether or not you see a similar type of opportunity to drive some elasticity of demand around pricing servers a bit more aggressively and related to that and then the whole strategy of attaching incremental products to that base. Im curious to understand whats happening in storage, doesnt seem like you are getting that attached to the installed base that you had hoped for in storage particularly with the DELL brand of the IP. Can you talk a little bit about that as well? Thanks a lot. Brian T. Gladden Yeah, Chris. Clearly the server business has had a nice run and this for us is the ninth consecutive quarter of solid growth there. The 12th generation servers that we launched about a year ago have contributed very nicely to the ramp in that business. They have as weve talked about before helped us improve our average selling price and that business moved to higher end work loads within the server space, and thats all been part of very strong progress and we think were winning in the marketplace as a result of the technology and how were positioned with that product. In addition, when you look at density optimized servers that as well contributed to the growth in this business. We see that as an important part of our offering and continue to make investments there. So the server business is in a good spot and we feel good about the technology and its not really a place where you see us trading at the low end for price for growth there. I think were growing on the basis of the technology. The storage business I think a little bit different discussion, we feel like that business is growing about in line with the market, its shrinking at the market  the market is shrinking and were seeing that from the data that we see in the market right now. I would say thats not what wed like to see obviously and thats not acceptable to us. Weve got some things from an execution standpoint in that business that we are working on. Were confident in the portfolio. Weve added commercial resources over the last really 18 months in this business and we feel like were positioned to actually outperform the market. Again, there is some execution things were working through and we expect to see that as we move forward. Operator We will take our next question from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Keith Bachman  Bank of Montreal Hi guys. Number one, Brian, can you talk a little bit about how your M&A strategy might differ if this transaction goes through versus would not? How might the incremental debt make you think about conducting M&A? And just a clarification to add on to that, can you talk about what your employee retention has been during this time of uncertainty, shall we say over the last few months why this deal has been contemplated? Robert Williams Hi Keith, this is Rob. I appreciate your questions and your answers, but given the current situation in the pending transaction, really not going to comment on that or any of the materials information thats related to the transaction. So youre welcome to take another crack at another question and you can drop back in the queue and well come back to you. Keith Bachman  Bank of Montreal How about just employee retention over the last three months Rob, can you address that as employees sticking on Board? Brian T. Gladden Yeah, Keith, its Brian. I would say attrition has been about normal course. Keith Bachman  Bank of Montreal Okay. Brian T. Gladden So weve havent seen unusual attrition. Keith Bachman  Bank of Montreal Okay, thats it from me. Robert Williams Thanks Keith. Operator Well take our next question from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Ananda Baruah  Brean Capital Hi, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I was wondering if we could just get your thoughts on I guess PC market over the next four to six quarters, you think you get softer, you think you get stronger. And if it were to get, I guess meaningfully softer from here would that move you to reconsider the pricing strategy that youve sort of employed the last couple of quarters? Thanks. Brian T. Gladden Yeah, look I think its a good question and its one we spent a lot of time debating and talking about  there are multiple dynamics playing out. I think you continue to see a Win 7 on the commercial side of the business. Its driving a refresh cycle. But at the same time and I would say even recently were seeing improved demand on the corporate and SMB markets. But if you look at consumer, you look at government; you look at federal those have been rather challenged. And its some of the things weve been talking about over the last few quarters where you have competing devices in some cases. Windows 8 has been from our standpoint, not necessarily the catalyst to drive accelerated growth that we had hoped it would be. We are encouraged by whats going to play out with new chip sets and some of the work that is going on within the windows ecosystem to hopefully over the next few months create some catalysts. But you look at the recent external data from any of the third party sources, we would expect to continue to see over the next few quarters year-over-year declines in PC demand and I think that we are trying to run the business based on that and be in a position where we are in this thing for the long term and we position the business for success for the long term. Ananda Baruah  Brean Capital Got it, thanks a lot. Operator We will take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Aaron Rakers  Stifel Nicolaus Yeah thanks for taking the question. Just real quickly on your software, your new software segment group, last quarter you talked about Quest actually performing better than your initial plan of $180 million to $200 million. Can you update us on the performance of Quest in the quarter and then also how do we to think about the profitability in that segment with the negative 29% operating margin this quarter? Brian T. Gladden Look, I think it is progressing as we expected and as we said in the talking points we expect to be accretive to the company in the first quarter, next fiscal year. That was the plan we talked about when we announced the acquisition and we are tracking towards that. I think the plan that we put together for that business with John Swainson clearly does have incremental investment as we look at adding R&D resources as we look at more sales capacity in that business and it has got to grow into the cost structure that we have in the software business, that is the way we are thinking about it. I would say we are tracking to that and the team is making good progress there and we still feel good about this. Now the operating loss from the quarter, that sort of what we had expected as we put this business together and really got it started up. So we feel good about it. Operator Well take our next question from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. Bill Shope  Goldman Sachs Okay thanks guys. Wanted to get some color on how you are targeting these pricing actions weve been discussing. Can you give us perhaps an example of how you determine which accounts are strategic enough for aggressive client pricing at least pricing thats beyond the norm in terms of discounting? And in what areas you maybe more focused on profit preservation? Im just trying to figure out where you draw the line so to speak in terms of profit versus market share focus. Brian T. Gladden Yeah I mean Ill give you a couple of thoughts Bill. I think we know where long-term strategic accounts are that where we can really leverage the relationship and being in as a  the leader on the client side, creates nice pull through in other parts of the portfolio. In many cases those are places that weve been before and had that business and in some  in many ways over the last couple of years walked away. So I would say those are obvious places that we know we can actually create a nice network effect for us and sell the broader set of solutions as well including the services. So I think weve been somewhat selective and try to focus in that part of business. There are clearly unit volume opportunities in places like consumer through indirect channels where we could sell a lot of units. But those dont really create for us any other profit or cash flow benefits. And therefore, were going to prioritize accounts where we can get that broader network benefit. Bill Shope  Goldman Sachs Thank you. Operator Ill take our next question from [Abhey Mamba with Mizuho Securities]. Unidentified Analyst Yeah, thanks. Brian, you talked about cost and demand for PCs doing well. Can you touch upon, is there a risk of it falling-off into few quarters as people have migrated auto win seven and part of that can you also talk about desktop virtualization, what are you seeing in the market for that and what are youre expectations for that given your thin client business. Brian T. Gladden Well, I think the data would suggest there is still a significant win seven refresh opportunity over the next year really until XP is sort of retired and we look at that in our discussions with customers. In many cases, theyve pushed those decisions out and theyre sort of catching up now and have to get that done in the next year. Beyond that obviously, it becomes a broader opportunity around touch and how that plays out in the corporate customer base, whether its tablets or whether its the next generation Windows 8 kinds of devices. So, again, its really up to us to create that opportunity and that ecosystem to drive that growth going forward with great products and great technology there, but I think thats clearly something were watching and it was for us as we headed into the new budget year for corporate customers, something we expect to see was some of that Windows 7 were account to happen and were starting to see some of that. Unidentified Analyst And desktop virtualization? Brian T. Gladden Yeah. Desktop virtualization continues to be a space that is I think of high interest to our customers in some parts of their business and there is a lot of customers that are looking at desktop virtualization for key subsets of their workforce where the work fits into that kind of a model, very few customers looking at broad companywide desktop virtualization kinds of implementation. So, were seeing good demand there, device business is performing well for us and important part o our offering as you think about broader End-user Computing devices. Tom Sweet I think were also happy with the pull through from the life devices into our ESG business in terms of our server and data center business. So we have seen good attach and good connectivity between those two product lines. Brian T. Gladden Great. Thanks and just we want to be respectful, Brocade has a call starting in just a few minutes. So McKinsey, lets take one more question. Operator We will now take our final question from Brian Marshall with ISI Group. Stephen Patel  ISI Group Thanks. This is Stephen Patel calling in for Brian. First question on your support and deployment revenue was up a little bit in the quarter and if you have any thoughts on how sustainable that is in light of the decline in PC units and whether weve been continue seeing increased attach rates going forward? Thanks. Tom Sweet Brian, its Tom. I would tell you that were happy with the attach rate and the SRUs weve been able to drive off of that services business. The team has done a great job of creating sort of new and innovative offers like the ProSupport Plus and some of the other types of products that were rolling out. And as a result of that, weve been able to keep the attach rate relatively high and pretty happy with sort of the pricing that goes with that. So despite some pressure from the downward units, the unit volume its been a good business for us and I think we continue to believe or will continue to be a good business. Brian T. Gladden And were also seeing good growth on support and deployment on the enterprise side of the business. Stephen Patel  ISI Group Yeah. Brian T. Gladden And nice attach rates there. So we think there is opportunities to continue to grow that business even going forward. Stephen Patel  ISI Group Thanks. Brian T. Gladden McKinsey? Tom Sweet And we believe that wrapped it up.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of todays call. (Operator Instructions) Well take our first question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty  Morgan Stanley Hi thanks, good afternoon. Given the significant change in profitability, can you just take a step back and talk about whether the margin deterioration this quarter is what you expected when you rolled out a more aggressive pricing strategy and if it was what you expected? Can you just go into a more detail around what it is, youre trying to accomplish, given that segment operating income dollars were almost cut in half and it doesnt drive top line growth? Thanks. Brian T. Gladden Yeah, Katy, I would say weve been talking about this for a couple of quarters about our need to adjust pricing. We did that. You saw some of that last quarter, it was affected by the settlements that we had as well and it wasnt quite as apparent in the P&L. But clearly weve been focused on this for a while. I think there are parts of the business where we are beginning to see some elasticity. Demand has been I would say weaker than we expected as we headed into the year. And I think the reality is in many cases these are accounts that were gaining that we feel very good about the long-term profitability and the impact on our cash flow over time. So while we may not see that showing up there is a positive in the P&L in the short-term, we think for the long-term its the right thing to do to get ourselves back in price position to scale the business. And I think as you look at the share dynamics that played out in the first quarter, we actually did improve our position on a share basis in a market thats pretty tough. So really conscious effort to position the business and something weve been working on for a few quarters now. Operator Well take our next question from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi  Sanford Bernstein Hi, yes thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on that. Is there a minimum acceptable level of profitability in the end-user computing group that you are willing to just staying on an ongoing basis in your effort to hold or gain share. And related to that, you talked about making investments in advance to your cost cutting. I think a year ago at your Analyst Day, you talked about this cost cutting. Given that youve started to be more price aggressive, why have you not been able to undertake any of this cost cutting to date, whats holding you back and wouldnt it make a lot more sense to be doing the cost cutting and more aggressive pricing concurrently? Brian T. Gladden Yeah, Toni, that wouldnt  without providing the details of the specific initiatives, I wouldnt say we havent executed on the cost initiatives. I think we have continued to take cost out of the business. We are just choosing consciously to reinvest those dollars in sales resources and R&D resources in the software business, things that weve talked about over time being important to the future of the company. So I think those things are going on concurrently and in this time right now, we have chosen to reinvest those savings that were driving as part of that initiative and important investments for the future of the company. Thats just what weve decided to do. In terms of profitability, I assume youre talking about the EUC business. Look, I think were not managing that business for one quarter at a time and I think there is a network effect to the impact of what we do there and the scale of that business and the customer relationships that we gain. We are clearly focused on cost in that business in this environment. We have been focused on gaining and improving the growth of that business and gaining share. Weve been able to do that. And as we execute on cost and continue to execute the strategy there, we are confident that will be an important part of the portfolio but not focused on a 90-day target relative to the profitability of that business. Operator We will take our next question from Brian Alexander with Raymond James. Brian Alexander  Raymond James Thanks. I guess following up on pricing, Brian, maybe just talk about why Dell has embraced such an abrupt change in pricing strategy in the client business in the last two quarters. Whats really caused such a sharp change in managements thinking? And related to that, how much of this is self inflicted to retain customers during this period of uncertainty and how much of this would you say is market driven. Brian T. Gladden I think its hard to separate this two, Brian. As you think about how market dynamics play out, clearly there are parts of the business, segments of the business where we are being more aggressive and we recognize that places where we have a strong foothold or historically have had a strong foothold can ultimately build on those relationships and benefit the entire portfolio of solutions. Those are places where clearly wed like to be a bit more aggressive and have over the last couple of quarters. I wouldnt say this has been a abrupt change clearly recognizing as demand weakened over the course of the last year. Weve recognized the need to stop shrinking at a rate faster than the market and weve made those adjustments over the course of a few different quarters here and have seen the impact of that. Improve in terms of growth rates and at the same time, impact short-term profitability for sure. Operator Well take our next question from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Maynard Um  Wells Fargo Hi thank you. Can you talk about your customer engagements and how those discussions are going in light of everything thats happening? How much of your time is being spend explaining kind of whats happening and are customers showing any indication of potentially holding out or lengthened sales cycles just to wait and see what happens. Thanks. Brian T. Gladden Yeah Maynard, I think in general the customer base has been very supportive of the company and long-term relationships, the quality of our solutions, the new solutions we are adding to the portfolio have really carried those relationships and not to say there arent some areas where weve seen questions and we have had to spend time with customers. Weve looked at it as a chance to spend more time with our customers and to make sure theyre comfortable with the strategy of the company and where we are taking it. And I would say for those conversations that I have been part of, those have been very good conversations that in many cases have resulted in more opportunities for the company. Operator We will take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross  Cross Research Thank you very much. Could you talk more about your increased investment in sales and distribution in key regions and segments? Brian T. Gladden This isnt new Shannon. We have been adding resources in the sales model really over the last couple of years and some of that was adding specialist capability around key technologies that weve been adding to the portfolio and doing that organically, but also many of the acquisitions obviously have brought capability from a commercial standpoint with them. Thats been one primary focus. I think the other is some specific regions and sub-segments to the market where weve got strong capability. And where weve seen good progress in terms of building out and adding sales people, we have not hesitated to add more. And tracking the progress and productivity of those sales resources making sure theyre delivering and bringing new business to the company and really taking advantage of places where we have strength has been the focus. Clearly the acquisition of Quest in the software business has brought significant sales capacity to the company and thats been one big area. And as you know and weve talked about a lot, the mid market is a place where we have focused and added resources as well. Operator Well take our next question from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Steve Milunovich  UBS Thank you. Back to the end-user pricing question, could you give a sense of how much of a strategic change this is because in the proxy materials, one of your consultant suggested shifting from a margin to a margin dollar, more commodity driven strategy and obviously weve seen some of that. Michael Dell has indicated apparently that he is going to kind of endorse that approach and shift. So, on the scale from 0% which is no change to 100%, which is a complete change. Are you kind of tweaking things now or do you feel like this is really taken into the full extent that we are likely to see over time in terms of going after more of a low end strategy? Brian T. Gladden Yeah, look Steve I wouldnt say our strategy has changed really at all. I think tactically weve recognized the need to be competitive. Weve adjusted our pricing appropriately. We are expanding our offerings across the portfolio of really offerings at high price bands or higher value products, mid value products, lower value products to play in key markets around the world as weve done over time. And I think youll continue to see us do that. Its not a  this is not a new strategy. This is not a new business model for us. I would say its adjusting tactics given what the markets doing and really where we need to be in the portfolio. Tom Sweet Yeah, Steve, I would say that  I think its fair to say that when you think about our portfolio of customers, the vast majority of those being commercial customers on a global basis. As weve talked through our and made decisions to increase our focus on those customers, there is acquisition business that you engage in. And as Brian alluded to earlier, you think its absolutely the right thing to do for the long-term. But these are accounts that you have to go out and take it different tax and pricing strategy with them and thats often to provide an entry level into that account. And so I think youre seeing a little bit of that in the P&L. Operator We will take our next question from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Kulbinder Garcha  Credit Suisse Thank you. Brian, a couple of kind of follow-ups and everything is being offered today. One of them is just on the End User Computing side, I take the point managing the business for the next 90 days and thats kind of quite clear. I guess intend to this pursue of new customers, can you speak about where we are in that process. Have you put the investments in sales pricing or otherwise you need to all is that significant more amount of effort to come through thats kind of one question. And the second is just the broad level, given the uncertainty thats going on at Dell over the last few months, I understand the sales cycle may not lengthen, but what financial impact would you say is having on ideal results or and how youre managing the business from a cost perspective? Im trying to understand with the margins youre producing overall, now they are lower. Do we seen for sometime, and some of that market, but some of that I think it has to be down to whats been going on with Dell. So any kind of insight there you can provide would be helpful? Brian T. Gladden Yeah, Ill try to answer the second part first Kulbinder. We havent changed the way were running the business. The strategy for the company has endured and I would say we continue to adapt that strategy given the market conditions and things that we learn as we go. But we have made no changes to the strategy and how were running the company as a result of this process. I think thats clear. And I would say its very difficult to quantify what impact the process that we are going to has had on the results of the company, we did callout incremental costs that we are incurring, the transaction costs that weve excluded from our non-GAAP reporting but clearly there is a chance to spend more time with customers and some level of customer just uncertainty that were working our way through. That said we feel like weve done a good job with that during this period. In terms of the EUC business and where we are positioned and where we are in that, I think that weve made a cautious decision here to improve the competitiveness and specifically the pricing. Weve got a lot of ongoing work around the productivity and cost structure of that business that will continue to allow us to be competitive there. And, I dont think this is something that we think about as an initiative. I think its really how we run the business and quarter-to-quarter manage the market conditions and the demand environment that were in. Tom Sweet I would also offer that acquiring new customers and continuing to build that acquisition pipeline is an ongoing and continual effort. Its just not a one quarter or two quarter effort, you build the acquisition pipeline, you continue to acquire new customers and you migrate those customers up to your business model and your other [laps]. So, I think that process continues. Brian T. Gladden And to some extent, I mean, we over some period of time as we were driving the business had, in some ways lost that ability to do the acquisition investments that we really needed. So, weve had obviously some success there and were getting a lot of very positive feedback from customers as we get back into that part of our business. Operator Well take our next question from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank. Chris Whitmore  Deutsche Bank Thanks very much.

There are clearly unit volume opportunities in places like consumer through indirect channels where we could sell a lot of units. But those dont really create for us any other profit or cash flow benefits. And therefore, were going to prioritize accounts where we can get that broader network benefit. Bill Shope  Goldman Sachs Thank you. Operator Ill take our next question from [Abhey Mamba with Mizuho Securities]. Unidentified Analyst Yeah, thanks. Brian, you talked about cost and demand for PCs doing well. Can you touch upon, is there a risk of it falling-off into few quarters as people have migrated auto win seven and part of that can you also talk about desktop virtualization, what are you seeing in the market for that and what are youre expectations for that given your thin client business. Brian T. Gladden Well, I think the data would suggest there is still a significant win seven refresh opportunity over the next year really until XP is sort of retired and we look at that in our discussions with customers. In many cases, theyve pushed those decisions out and theyre sort of catching up now and have to get that done in the next year. Beyond that obviously, it becomes a broader opportunity around touch and how that plays out in the corporate customer base, whether its tablets or whether its the next generation Windows 8 kinds of devices. So, again, its really up to us to create that opportunity and that ecosystem to drive that growth going forward with great products and great technology there, but I think thats clearly something were watching and it was for us as we headed into the new budget year for corporate customers, something we expect to see was some of that Windows 7 were account to happen and were starting to see some of that. Unidentified Analyst And desktop virtualization? Brian T. Gladden Yeah. Desktop virtualization continues to be a space that is I think of high interest to our customers in some parts of their business and there is a lot of customers that are looking at desktop virtualization for key subsets of their workforce where the work fits into that kind of a model, very few customers looking at broad companywide desktop virtualization kinds of implementation. So, were seeing good demand there, device business is performing well for us and important part o our offering as you think about broader End-user Computing devices. Tom Sweet I think were also happy with the pull through from the life devices into our ESG business in terms of our server and data center business. So we have seen good attach and good connectivity between those two product lines. Brian T. Gladden Great. Thanks and just we want to be respectful, Brocade has a call starting in just a few minutes. So McKinsey, lets take one more question. Operator We will now take our final question from Brian Marshall with ISI Group. Stephen Patel  ISI Group Thanks. This is Stephen Patel calling in for Brian. First question on your support and deployment revenue was up a little bit in the quarter and if you have any thoughts on how sustainable that is in light of the decline in PC units and whether weve been continue seeing increased attach rates going forward? Thanks. Tom Sweet Brian, its Tom. I would tell you that were happy with the attach rate and the SRUs weve been able to drive off of that services business. The team has done a great job of creating sort of new and innovative offers like the ProSupport Plus and some of the other types of products that were rolling out. And as a result of that, weve been able to keep the attach rate relatively high and pretty happy with sort of the pricing that goes with that. So despite some pressure from the downward units, the unit volume its been a good business for us and I think we continue to believe or will continue to be a good business. Brian T. Gladden And were also seeing good growth on support and deployment on the enterprise side of the business. Stephen Patel  ISI Group Yeah. Brian T. Gladden And nice attach rates there. So we think there is opportunities to continue to grow that business even going forward. Stephen Patel  ISI Group Thanks. Brian T. Gladden McKinsey? Tom Sweet And we believe that wrapped it up.

And with that, I will turn the call over to David. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Discovery's first quarter marked a solid start to 2017 highlighted by strong gains in global distribution revenues, continued ratings momentum across our portfolio of superfan brands and channels, and distinct progress in growing our digital and direct-to-consumer businesses. As the media landscape continues to evolve, we are focused on strengthening our global content portfolio and positioning it to reach our superfans every way they consume content. We continue to make significant headway on our strategy of maximizing our existing linear business, while simultaneously driving growth and investing in areas like mobile and OTT. Since the start of the year, we expanded multiple existing digital initiatives such as: our Amazon SVOD channels partnership in the U.S.; we made demonstrable progress with Eurosport Player, our live streaming service in Europe that provides an all access pass to the greatest sports events; and we entered into several strong new digital partnerships, including a pioneering joint venture with Germany's ProSieben to create a next-generation streaming OTT service, a first of its kind partnership in Europe. I'd like to spend a moment talking about the solid performance of our global content portfolio. In the U.S., our networks outperformed the down-market in both prime and total day led by Discovery and TLC, and also strength at ID, OWN and Velocity, which helped drive our U.S. ad sales up 2% on an underlying basis or 1% excluding the impact of the Group Nine transaction. And internationally, our ad sales grew 3%. In the U.S., Discovery Channel was again the number one non-sports cable network for men. And TLC continued its resurgence, gaining nearly 20% and ranking as a top ranked network for women. Internationally, TLC posted strong double digit viewership for the quarter and set new delivery records. At ID, we maintained first place in total debuting among women in the U.S., a significant achievement with also the longest length of view in cable. We did that while growing our international ID viewership by 17%. Velocity and, international counterpart, Turbo saw their highest U.S. ratings ever and substantial international growth in the high [audio skip] (5:01) men's demo. Turning to our distribution business, our domestic affiliate revenue grew 5% in the first quarter and our international affiliate revenue climbed 10% organically, driven in part by our enhanced portfolio of sports, including the Olympic Games in Europe for the next four games, which begins next year. Looking next at our overall digital and direct-to-consumer business, we continue to aggressively pursue our three-pronged global digital strategy. First, we are driving our authenticated TV Everywhere offerings that enable cable and satellite superfans to watch our long-form content wherever they want, whenever they want. Second, we're taking our long-form content over-the-top with new distribution partners as well as direct-to-consumer offerings. Finally, we are focused on short-form mobile-first content that appeals largely to a younger audience. During the quarter, we made real progress with our first initiative around TV Everywhere. In the U.S., our suite of GO apps is growing rapidly and are also driving awareness and engagement for our linear brands. Our GO apps are now available to 80% of U.S. households. And by year-end, we expect they will be available on 115 million connected devices including on Roku, PlayStation 4, Apple TV and Xbox. We are seeing great consumer engagement with GO, especially with younger viewers. Even as our streaming volume increases, 18 to 34 year olds still account for half of our visitors. GO is now delivering incremental revenues as well. In the first quarter, we realized a full point of ad sales growth domestically from GO. And we expect to continue improving our monetization going forward. Outside the U.S., our market-leading TV Everywhere product in Latin America, Discovery Kids Play, continues to grow. We now have 60% distribution across all of Latin America, with 90% distribution in Brazil. And in Europe, our direct-to-consumer streaming service, Dplay, reported 19% year-over-year subscriber growth as both local content and global tent poles like Gold Rush helped drive higher overall viewing across linear and digital. The second piece of our digital strategy is expanding the reach of our long-form content through over-the-top direct-to-consumer and onto new and emerging platforms. As mentioned, the Eurosport Player, our sports Netflix product, is off to a fantastic start this year with year-to-date gross subs up over 70% and our total sub base up almost 50% year-over-year, suggesting our new season pass strategy from Paul Guyardo and his team is beginning to work. You may recall that it was Paul who built DIRECTV's NFL Sunday Ticket season pass and other sports packages to an over $2 billion business. Paul's country-by-country approach has pivoted the business away from a one size fit all model to one that marries tailoring pricing and packaging strategies such as seasons passes with specific premium and local sports rights. Another key direct-to-consumer offering is our recently announced joint venture with Germany's number one commercial broadcaster, ProSieben. Together, we are launching an ad and subscription option video on demand service that will stream our combined free-to-air channels in Germany. This product will help strengthen our All Screen strategy and deliver incremental advertising dollars in one of our most important international markets. We will welcome discussions with other media companies to participate in our partnership. We also continue to pursue OTT and direct-to-consumer products in deep niche verticals that appeal to our fans with specific affinities and passions. In the U.S., our Amazon streaming channels continue to grow, and we recently launched a third subscription video on demand channel on Amazon, Say Yes, featuring more than 500 hours of exclusive wedding content. Say Yes follows the success of True Crime Files by ID and Destination Unknown, which we launched last year. While it's early days, we believe our niche verticals have strong appeal with superfans, and we continue to explore opportunities for our genres where we have a unique brand advantage. Our third area of focus in digital is creating short-form mobile-first content that appeals primarily to a younger audience. A key vehicle is our strategic partnership with Group Nine, which continues to build momentum and, today, achieves 4.2 billion monthly video views across our properties, including Thrillist, The Dodo, Seeker and NowThis. We continue to work together to sell our Group Nine brands in conjunction with our GO apps in order to deliver a true 360-degree solution targeting millennials. During the quarter, we also announced that Group Nine's NowThis, a leading creator of short-form video for social media, and Eurosport will partner to produce and distribute sports-related social media, including content around the 2018 Olympic Winter Games. We're also working closely with Snapchat, which we see as an important new way to reach younger viewers, leveraging the platform's 160 million daily users, over half of who are ages 13 to 24. We now have several Snapchat channels, including Eurosport, NowThis and The Dodo, and we'll also be creating premium Snapchat content around marquee Discovery brands like Shark Week starting this summer. In summary, as the media industry continues to evolve, we will continue to grow our businesses while positioning ourselves for the future with new ways to reach and engage our global superfans. Part of paving a successful road ahead is ensuring we have the best, most forward-looking team in media. We recently welcomed Gunnar Wiedenfels as our new CFO and he has hit the ground running. Gunnar's extensive experience in Europe and international markets and in building direct-to-consumer and digital businesses is already proving invaluable as we focus increasingly on all three areas to drive growth at Discovery. So, for the first time, I'll turn the call over to Gunnar for a detailed look at our financial performance. Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc. Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone, also from my side. I want to start off by saying that I'm very excited to be here at Discovery. Discovery is a company with an incredible global reputation, especially in Europe, and I have followed its trajectory closely throughout my career. David and his team have built an unrivaled portfolio of global brands that is uniquely positioned for growth around the world. I am thrilled to have joined this world-class team and to bring my prior experience in the European and digital markets to this exciting and dynamic company. I'm very optimistic about Discovery's strategic positioning and outlook, and I look forward to speaking with all of you more going forward. Now, delving into our financials, as David highlighted, our first quarter results were driven by continued global distribution growth combined with a strict focus on cost management. Our total company reported revenues and adjusted OIBDA were up 3% and 5%, respectively, while constant currency revenues and adjusted OIBDA were up 5% and 4%, respectively. Currency impacts continue to improve. In the first quarter, currency reduced revenue growth by 2%, while the combination of our successful hedging program and certain emerging market currencies moving in our favor led to currency helping our adjusted OIBDA growth by 1%. Net income available to Discovery Communications of $215 million decreased versus the first quarter a year ago. This was on the positive side driven by our improved operating performance and lower effective tax rate. These positive effects were more than offset by a one-time debt extinguishment charge, a larger solar-related loss from equity investees, and higher restructuring charges. Please let me explain these effects in a bit more detail. Our tax rate of 20% was a full 700 basis points lower than our full year 2016 rate as we began to realize the beneficial tax credits of our investments in solar power. On the flip side, our equity income was impacted by an initial first quarter $83 million pre-tax book loss due to the timing of losses allocated from our solar investments. These book losses created a negative equity income, which was otherwise positively impacted by improved contributions from OWN and other investments. Looking forward on the full year, we still expect our full year tax rate to be 20% or below, primarily due to our solar investments, while the full year book loss from solar is expected to total approximately $200 million, approximately $30 million of which are expected for the second quarter. Net-net, we still anticipate that our solar investments will have a positive impact on full year net income as the benefits from our tax credits as well as the tax shield on the book losses will more than outweigh the $200 million book losses. Let us now turn to EPS. Earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.37 and adjusted earnings per diluted share, which excludes the impact of acquisition-related non-cash amortization of intangible assets, was $0.41. That means, excluding currency impacts, adjusted EPS was down $0.05 or 11% for the quarter, but was up 9% year-over-year for the last 12-month period. Excluding currency impacts and the $34 million or $0.06 after-tax one-time debt extinguishment charges, first quarter adjusted EPS increased by 2%. First quarter free cash flow, while traditionally the lowest of the year, did increase significantly to $208 million. This was primarily due to a large decrease in cash tax payments, partially due to certain payments being deferred to the second quarter this year versus being paid in the first quarter last year, as well as our improved operating results despite higher capital expenditures due to an increase in technology and infrastructure spending. Turning to the operating units, let me start with U.S. Networks. Our U.S. Networks had another solid quarter, with total revenues up 3%, led by 5% distribution growth and 1% advertising growth, and adjusted OIBDA up 6% given our reduction of total domestic costs. Our advertising growth of 1%, or 2% on an underlying basis excluding the impact of December's Group Nine transaction and the deconsolidation of Seeker and SourceFed, was primarily due to pricing and improved monetization of our GO platforms, which added a point of growth in the quarter, partially offset by lower delivery due to continued universe decline. As we look ahead to the second quarter of 2017, we currently expect U.S. ad growth to be up low-single digits on an underlying basis or flat to up slightly on a reported basis after including the impact from the Group Nine transaction. In more detail, while delivery is expected to be down due to continued universe declines and Shark Week moving to the third quarter versus mostly in the second quarter last year, we continue to maximize yield on our linear networks as pricing remains healthy. Additionally, included in our outlook is, again, a point of growth from our GO platform. Looking at distribution, our first quarter domestic distribution revenues were up 5%, with growth primarily driven by higher contracted affiliate rates partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers. To a lesser extent, the growth was driven by contributions from other distribution revenues, i.e., content deliveries under licensing agreements. Total portfolio subs in the first quarter declined by just over 3% year-over-year, a slight acceleration versus the fourth quarter. As we stated on our year-end call, we still expect 2017 full year distribution revenue growth to be in the mid-single digit range, assuming subscriber trends remain relatively consistent. We will continue to benefit from higher pricing in our existing affiliate deals and we will also continue to aggressively pursue additional ways to increase our digital distribution revenues and monetize our content across all platforms with existing and new distribution partners as the media landscape continues to change. Turning to the cost side, operating expenses in the quarter were down 2%. Costs of revenues were down 5%, mostly due to lower impairment charges and the timing of content expense. SG&A increased 4%, primarily due to higher marketing costs. The decline in total cost led to an adjusted OIBDA growth of 6% with margins expanding by almost 200 basis points to an impressive 60%. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we will continue to focus on managing limiting U.S. cost growth with a year-over-year total cost growth expected to peak in the low-single digit range in the third quarter due to Shark Week and our scripted drama MANHUNT: UNABOMBER. I will now turn to our international operations. Reported revenues and adjusted OIBDA were up 5% and 7% respectively, while excluding currency, revenues increased 8% and adjusted OIBDA increased 4%. For comparability purposes, my following international comments will refer to our organic results only, so will exclude the impact of currency. The 8% first quarter revenue growth was comprised of 10% distribution growth and 3% advertising growth. Our 10% distribution revenue growth was driven by higher affiliate rates throughout Europe where we have already been successful in monetizing our expanded content portfolio that now includes sports to secure higher contracted pricing increases. Second driver was Latin America with an increased subscriber number and higher pricing. Looking forward, second quarter growth will decelerate 200 basis points from the 10% increase in the first quarter. This is primarily due to prior year comps with a catch up effect associated with contract renewals in the second quarter of last year. That being said, for the full year, we're still aiming for the distribution revenue growth of 12% to 13%. Our 3% advertising growth was mostly driven by increases in the Nordics, primarily due to higher pricing and volume and the absence of the Telenor blackout that occurred in the first quarter of 2016, higher volume and ratings in Latin America, and higher pricing and volume in CEEMEA. These increases were offset by declines in the UK, where we were impacted by overall market weakness as the total market was down in the high-single digit range as well as lower ratings on our own networks, and declines in our smallest market, Asia-Pacific, primarily due to weakness in India post November's demonetization. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect ad sales to again be up in the low-to-mid single digit range as we expect positive ad growth in Southern and Eastern Europe, the Nordics, and LatAm to likely again be partly offset by declines in Asia-Pacific and the UK due to continued market softness. Turning to the cost side, operating expenses internationally grew 9% in the first quarter, primarily due to higher sports content and production costs. Looking ahead, we expect total cost growth to be in the high-single digits to low-double digit range each quarter for the rest of the year with growth peaking in the third quarter primarily due to the timing of our sports rights. Now, taking a look at our overall financial picture, in the first quarter, we spent a total of $200 million repurchasing our own shares after investing a gross amount of $181 million in solar. We have now spent over $8.2 billion buying back shares since we began our buyback program in 2010, and we have reduced our outstanding share count by over 36%. Discovery's capital allocation philosophy will be a top priority of mine over the next couple of months, and I will work closely with David, our senior management team and our board of directors on how to best position the company to maximize returns on our invested capital. While we remain completely committed to maintain our investment grade rating, we will take a fresh look at our target leverage ratios and investment priorities as well as hurdle rates. At this point, for the second quarter, our capital allocation priorities will be the same as over the last two quarters. We're not committing to a specific level of buybacks, but we'll allocate excess capital beyond any high return investments towards repurchasing our shares. On solar, we have already spent over half of the $340 million 2017 gross commitment amount. And in the second quarter, we currently expect to invest another $50 million in additional solar investments. One other item I would like to note is the financial impact of the Raw and Betty sale, which closed at the end of April. Raw and Betty contributed approximately $8 million to $10 million of revenues per quarter to our Education and Other segment, which includes our studios business, with a minimal impact on adjusted OIBDA. Finally, we are reiterating our full year guidance of constant currency adjusted EPS growth of at least low-to-mid teens. Growth will be driven by maximizing our advertising and distribution revenues on our existing linear business and across new and emerging platforms, combined with a continued laser focus on controlling cost growth and a lower effective tax rate. Pulling together our commentary on U.S. and international costs, we continue to expect total company constant currency cost of revenues to grow in the high-single to low-double digit range, and total company constant currency SG&A growth to be flat to up low-single digits. I would also note, as has consistently been our practice, that our adjusted EPS guidance does not adjust for any below-the-line items except for purchase price amortization. So it does not back out the first quarter one-time debt extinguishment charges. It also assumes full year stock-based compensation of approximately $30 million to $40 million. I'm also pleased to reiterate our growth guidance for the full year 2017 constant currency free cash flow of at least low-double digits. While we now expect capital expenditures to be up year-over-year to just over $100 million as we continue to invest in technology and infrastructure, we now expect our full year cash tax rate to be in the low-to-mid 20% range, down from our prior expectation of the high 20% range due to the timing of expected additional refunds. Finally, we are reiterating our three-year 2015 to 2018 guidance for constant currency adjusted EPS and constant currency free cash flow CAGRs to grow at least low teens. I also want to update you on our expected year-over-year foreign exchange impact on our full year reported results, which has improved versus our prior guidance, given the recent weakening of the dollar as well as our hedging program. Assuming rates stay constant for the rest of the year, the year-over-year FX impact on revenues is now expected to be negative $20 million to $30 million. On AOIBDA, currency has become a slight tailwind and is expected to have a positive impact of $10 million to $20 million, and currency is now expected to have a negative $0.09 to $0.11 impact on adjusted EPS, primarily due to last year's below-the-line FX gains. In closing, while I have only been here for a relatively short time, I'm extremely pleased with Discovery's start to 2017 and our outlook for the rest of year. I'm very optimistic about the global portfolio and our overall financial and operating room (25:41). Thank you again for your time this morning, and now David and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have. Question-and-Answer Session Operator And our first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thank you very much. Just following up on your comments on domestic advertising trends, where you highlighted better pricing, I guess, any more color on the scatter market and how it's trending in the second quarter? And then, just a quick follow up on your commentary on your investment in short-form digital video that you highlighted. Can you add some color on how you expect to monetize it over time? Is it largely gaining mind share for the millennials and building up your brand? Or do you see, I guess, an incremental revenue opportunity associated with those videos as well? Thank you. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. Sure. Hi, Alexia. The advertising market kind of feels steady as she goes. We don't have a lot of visibility to the upfront, but scatter pricing is up mid-to-high teens over the upfront. The volume is relatively steady. We come into the market right now in the second quarter and into the upfront, I think, with a very compelling story. Our ratings are up. We're up in April in prime, up 5%, while the industry is down 8%. And for the full year-to-date, we're flat in prime with the industry down 6% and broadcast down 12%. But, more importantly, I think we're a very protected environment. Our brands have never been stronger. So not only do we have a growth story, but we have a real strength of viewership story on ID, on TLC, on Discovery, on OWN. And so, it's an environment the advertisers are quite comfortable with, and so I think that we're finding the market to be steady, and we're starting to take advantage of it with the quality of our brands and the fact that we actually have some real ratings. On the short-form monetization, the good news for us is that we're learning a ton. This whole Group Nine transaction has been terrific for us. We're building even stronger relationships with Facebook and Snapchat. We're understanding a lot more about the consumption of one minute videos. We're up to over 4 billion in views. We're the number one or two video provider for news on Facebook, and we're experimenting with them in different ways to monetize that. Guyardo is working with our entire team in putting Group Nine together with GO, together with our traditional inventory, so we have a great 360. And together with Snapchat, I feel like we're reaching more demos, a significant difference from two or three years ago where we felt like some of those demographics were being left behind and our story-telling capability in short-form, we felt like really needed to be improved. So we're quite happy with where we are. I think the monetization of short-form has a fairly long way to go. And so if there is upside there or if it takes a turn, we are now one of the  we're the number two or three provider of short-form content in terms of all the media companies, and we have a right to take control of Group Nine in two years. So I think it's been good and it's working very well with our ad sales team, and it gives us, I think, a very forward-looking view in terms of being able to reach all demos as we hit the upfront. Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hey, good morning. David, can you talk a little bit about your expectation? I believe your guidance is for acceleration in international distribution revenue growth later this year. And any update on sort of how you're thinking about the Bundesliga rights monetization. And I don't know if you guys are comfortable talking about through the Olympics next year, but to the extent you can help us think about distribution revenue trajectory into 2018. That would be really helpful. And Gunnar, I was just curious if you could  I don't know if you're willing to, but if you could give us the impact on U.S. distribution revenue from the year-over-year licensing change. I don't know if there's any  like a basis points impact or anything to help us isolate the core number. Thank you both. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. One point before I pass off to Gunnar who spent an enormous amount of time dealing with these issues in Germany and with ProSieben. One of our philosophies on our IP is that we own it on all platforms, which is meaningfully different from the way that sports is sold here in the U.S., for instance, where when you see it on a mobile player or on another platform, it might be the league that sells it, it might not  somebody's buying a broadcast window or a cable window. So when it comes to the Olympics and when it comes to the Bundesliga, when it comes to all of our sports rights, when it comes to almost all of our IP, we own it for all platforms. And so, if you see our content turning up or if you see the Olympic rings turning up with a mobile player in Europe, if you see the content over-the-top on mobile, on any platform, or the Bundesliga or any of our sports, that's why we can go direct-to-consumer with it, we could offer some of it free. And so, I think there's no question we're a little bit long on IP. We are profitable with our sports, but we're long on it because we think owning that IP for all platforms, owning our kids IP for all platforms, is part of the part of this transition we're making into creating real value to address some of the terminal value concerns that the industry's facing. Gunnar? Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc. Yeah, sure. Ben, good morning. So, on the affiliate revenue growth guidance for international, as you could hear in my opening remarks, we're continuing to target a 12% to 13% full year growth rate, and if you look at the run rates, as you say, we got 10% in Q1. I also said that we're going to see a slightly lower rate in Q2, which is not a change in the trend, but it's more related to a prior year comp where we had some catch up in Q2 2016. And then, as you say, we're targeting a pickup in the second half based on some deals that we're working on currently to get to that 12% to 13% figure for the full year. On Bundesliga specifically, maybe allow me one or two comments. As David said, I've lived in that market for all of my life, and really, it's important to understand Bundesliga is one of the top, top sports franchises in the market. We've got a good share of that. We own the rights for four years. It's a strong right and a good deal for us in terms of the duration. And looking at the number of players that are in the market that are looking for premium IP, we're talking to a number of players, and I'm absolutely convinced that the Bundesliga deal will help us strengthen the portfolio in the market. Talking about Bundesliga, again, from my perspective, a very interesting deal; I very much like that pan-European cross-platform approach to that deal. And again, I believe we will be able to create a lot of value, especially if you look at the eight-year period that we're looking at. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. For the Olympics. Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc. For the Olympics, yes. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. And the deals that we've done for the Olympics thus far have been ahead of plan. And by locking in those rights, we're excited about the fact that Germany is kind of the real center spoke of Europe, so not only do we have Eurosport free-to-air and pay in Germany, we have a free-to-air female channel, a free-to-air male channel, and we'll be doing the Olympics ourselves in Germany, which we think will add a significant amount of value, and having extra scale in Germany is important to us because it's such a robust market. Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc. And then, Ben, maybe your second question, the impact of those other distribution revenues on the U.S. side, we just felt it important to highlight that there were some contributions from those deals. It's small in the greater scheme of things in the whole distribution revenue line item. And we see more of those deals coming forward as we look at the full year. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. So that was really just some bulk delivery of content to our existing partners. It's a very small component of Q1, but when you add it on top, it provided some growth. So we felt it important to point that out and we may do more of those. Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Got it. Thank you, both. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC Thank you. Two  one following up on Ben and a new one. David, you guys been very clear about the Olympics in 2018 driving affiliate revenue growth internationally, it's going to step up. Could you talk a bit about how the costs layer in for the Olympics and is 2018 incrementally profitable because of those stepped up affiliate fees or is the Olympic profitability more back ended? And then, on the cost line, if you go back to your Investor Day in 2015, like almost two years ago, you guys talked about your ability to control costs under different scenarios of revenues. Now that we're two years later and you kind of see the normal rate of growth in the market, can you talk again about your ability to control cost and kind of what's the right way to think about domestic cost growth if this is the new normal of revenue growth? Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc. Okay. Michael, this is Gunnar. Let me take that. So, on the Olympics, it's still too early to really talk about the exact cadence of how the P&L impact will turn out. A couple of things that are clear from today's perspective is that the 2018 allocation of cost is going to be the lowest given that we don't have all the rights or not as many rights as in later years. So we will update our models and update you as soon as we have a reliable set of figures across those eight years. Generally speaking, the Winter Games are less expensive than the Summer Games, and we definitely see an upside from the Olympics deal generally on affiliate revenues. As a matter of fact, you can already see European affiliate revenues going back to double-digit without even having factored in all the sports rights. And we also, obviously, see contributions from our Eurosport Player. (37:10) David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. The cadence that Gunnar was talking about is simply that we got all the rights for eight years, but in the UK and in France, we didn't get the Olympic rights until 2022 and 2024, but we did structure a deal with the BBC, whereas part of their rights to carry the Olympics, we got a substantial amount of rights and extensive digital rights in 2020 and 2022. But when you allocate the actual fees, because of France and the UK, the cadence is a little bit different, that's all. Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc. And then, Michael, on the cost guidance, I think, looking at the Q1 numbers, you see that the company is very focused on cost management. Clearly, coming in, I will continue that focus and take a fresh look at cost as well, but I must say I'm very happy with the performance that Discovery has delivered on the cost side in Q1. So, the general guidance for us for 2017, as I said before, is total company organic cost of revenues up high-single to low-double digits, and we will be even more restrictive on SG&A on a total company level targeting flat-to-low single digit increases for our cost base. So please be assured it will continue to be a clear focus of the management team here. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. And Michael, just to confirm our company but also my full engagement in social media, I was following the hundreds of notes and likes for your birthday yesterday on Facebook, as well as the numerous picture posts, all of which I thought were very nice. Happy birthday. Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC Thanks, David. Thank you. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield of BTIG. Your line is now open. Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC Hi, thanks for taking the question. AT&T's Randall Stephenson was testifying before Congress late last year, and he said point-blank to Congress that he said a huge number of consumers want cheaper video bundles without the high cost of sports. And David, you've talked to the rise of these new virtual MVPDs as an opportunity. So far, they seem all very sports heavy, including kind of, as a basis, the broadcasters and the RSNs, which push not only the cost towards $40, but it also has led to Discovery and others being left out of things like Hulu and YouTube launches. Wondering what do you think of the prospects are for new bundles that may not have the broadcasters or may not have the RSNs that could be priced below $20. And then I have a follow-up on Group Nine. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. Thanks, Rich. Well, first, I think, ultimately, consumer behavior and consumer consumption is what drives the capitalist market. So you can develop a channel, but you have to create content that people want to get nourished by. So you can sit in a conference room and say what you want to provide people. Ultimately, the consumer is the one that is always the determining winner. And you look at outside the U.S.  outside the U.S., there have been very successful skinny bundles. We're on all of them. We have quality content with strong brands that are valued. Our cost of content is relatively low. And we've done extremely well on all of those skinny bundles all over the world, in Latin America, in Eastern Europe and Europe, and each of them have been in the very low price range. And even when there is sports, sports is just hyper-extended here in the U.S. reflected in regional sports, traditional sports. Retransmission can extend the integration of sports with other channels. And so this is a bit of a stuffed turkey here, and in many ways, when I read about the skinny bundle here in the U.S., I see the skinny bundle in 200 countries. When I look here in the U.S. and I read skinny bundle, there is no skinny bundle here. Skinny bundle in the U.S. is a fiction. The idea that you have a $40 offering filled with regional sports, sports and all these  an incomplete package, really, and then you have to buy broadband on top of it, so the skinny bundle is $60 or $70. So it's really not a skinny bundle. It's a bundle. It's a bundle that may be attractive to a small group of people. But, in the end, I think the market will be rationalized. We represent 12% or 13% of viewership. We have the top channel for women in ID, the number one channel for men in Discovery, top channel in Middle America with TLC, a top channel for African Americans with Oprah and Tyler, and our cost of content is low. We are on DIRECTV NOW. We're on Sony. We're on many of the platforms. But, ultimately, there should be a bundle like everywhere else in the world that's $8, $10, $12. And I believe that will happen. I think these overstuffed turkeys are going to end up being a challenge from a consumer perspective, and the consumer's going to say, I'd like to have an opportunity here. And in many ways, Netflix is a terrific company, and they continue to be very effective, and so does Amazon, but we as an industry need to complement that with a quality offering that isn't  that's a true skinny bundle in the spirit of what's working around the world, and I think that'll happen. It's just a question of when. Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC And just wanted to follow up on Group Nine. I think you mentioned 4-plus billion, I lost the exact number, but 4-plus billion views is what you're getting across a variety of online mobile platforms. Is that a business that at that scale is generating profits or is that a business that's still losing money? Or like, is there any way to size kind of the revenues and whether it's profitable or not? David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. Well, it's not profitable, but it's pretty close, and our overall approach right now  it's run by Ben Lerer, who's doing a terrific job there. We put some of our assets into it. When we closed on it, it was $3 billion. Now it's $4.2 billion. We continue to learn about what engages people. We have great analytics. So I think that it helped us lean into our understanding of what kind of content we could provide for Snapchat. It's informing the way we tell stories, the kind of stories. And so this pivot to mobile is quite important for us. As we look at over $7 billion screens out there, we're the leader in traditional platform on linear around the world, and we own all of our content so we can move a lot of our long-form content. But being able to repackage with The Dodo, we have Animal Planet, which is a leader around the world, and now we have The Dodo, which is the leader now in short-form animal content on the web. And so being able to own those different areas are critical. We're not focused today on making money. We're focused on learning. We're focused on getting more scale. We're focused on building our relationship with Snapchat, with Facebook, with all of the different outlets out there, and have millennials kind of really get nourished and excited about what we're doing. And in the long term, we're hopeful that they'll be a meaningful currency, and we're actually working with Facebook now on different ways that we can do that, which I think is in both of our interests. Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open. Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi, good morning. I'm following along for my colleagues across the various revenue lines. I guess maybe I'll tackle international advertising, if I may, especially since you guys probably have the best view of that of pretty much any company I know. So, I guess I'd frame my question this way. If you think about sort of the run rate that you are at this quarter and have been for a while, and compare that back to the Investor Day, which your expectations, I think, were somewhat higher, trying to figure out like what's caused that delta? How much of it is cyclical? How much of it is structural? How much of it is geopolitical? And are we basically at a new reality now where the run rate we're seeing is kind of the run rate going forward? And just a quick follow-on related is we've talked about the Olympics in many ways. Nobody's asked yet about Olympics advertising. Again, I don't know what you're prepared to comment on, but it's only a year away for the Winter Games, which is a big geography for you. Any help you can give on advertising perspective, just the magnitude of that box as we're thinking of where the health could be there? Thanks. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. Okay. Thanks, Todd. On the advertising side, look, we  in Europe, we really haven't gotten help in 11 years. GDP across Europe, if you take out the UK, has been effectively flat, and the advertising follows GDP. So we've been able to grow despite that. But there have been some geopolitical issues. There's no question. You have the UK down 4% and Brexit has had a meaningful impact on the UK. That's a big market for us. There was a restructure in Russia. We're one of the leading players in Russia. We were the first ones that were brought back. Many of the media companies that want to get into Russia now have to go through our media partnership. But Russia changed because we can only own 20% of it. There are values that we can get outside of the 20%, but things changed there. So, in mainland Europe, we're doing quite well. We're growing in  outside of the UK and Asia, we're growing in every market. And Latin America is growing high-single digit now, but it was growing 20%, 30%. So the fact that Brazil kind of tipped and Argentina has struggled for a while, and Mexico is having some challenges is having an impact, but we're still seeing high-single digit growth in Latin America. We're still seeing growth across all of Europe. Some of that has to do with the fact that our share is growing, and our brands are stronger, but we expect that that will continue, and we're used to doing business in a difficult environment. The other thing that we're seeing is Asia is tough, and it's likely to be tougher. In some ways, we have a smaller business in India, but I'm glad we have a smaller business in India because the demonetization has been a struggle. The recovery from that demonetization has been longer than expected. We got a report out this morning and yesterday from the team over there now. It looks like things are slow and there's a government regulation regime that looks like it may be coming down in India, that's going to put a damper on a lot of the growth that was assumed to be coming out of there. The good news for us is that's going to have a very minimal effect on us. So I think our positioning of being big Europe, quite strong in Italy and Germany and across all of Europe with real scale, together with strong positioning in Latin America probably puts us in as good of a position as we could be in. I wouldn't want to overweight in Asia right now. And the other Asia issue is just being the potential, and we're looking at doing this, of just jumping right over in many of these markets traditional distribution and going direct-to-consumer, which is what we're looking at doing in a lot of the areas in Asia. We're entrenched in a very good business in Japan, but it's not growing that much, and a lot of other areas of Asia, we're actually going to  we're going to take all of our IP and we're going direct. So, I like our combination. It's certainly not robust. I would say steady eddy, and I wouldn't expect that things are going to get much better. I hope we don't have more Brexits. I think the France thing helps us. Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc. And Todd, maybe if I can add one point to that discussion, I think if you take a step back, you referred to the 2015 mid-term guidance, right? Yes, advertising has been somewhat slower, affiliate has been slightly stronger, and if you look at the total company guidance, EPS, free cash flow guidance has even been raised after. Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Fair point. Thanks. Any comment on the Olympics while we're on this or not? Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc. Yeah, so as I said before, it's really too early to give you any specific numbers, but I feel very strong about the Olympics deal. We have all kinds of monetization opportunities: sub-licensing, affiliate, advertising. We have complete rights, all platforms. So we'll be able to cover literally every moment of the games on air, online, over-the-top, on-the-go. So I think there's a lot of opportunity for us, but please understand, it's just too early to give you any specific guidance there. Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC Thank you. This is David Joyce for Vijay. Could you please help us think about the distribution opportunity internationally? Obviously, you've talked a lot around your over-the-top and direct-to-consumer opportunities, but with the increasing penetration around the globe of the pay TV footprint, how should we think about growth in the different regions? Thank you. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. Sure. What we've seen is, across Europe, we'd expect it to be relatively flat, maybe even slightly We pivoted. We pulled our signal four times in the last 18 months, so most of our growth now is coming from price. We're being helped by sports. In Latin America, a lot of our growth is coming from price, which is really a change. If you look at the last 15 years, the majority of growth in Latin America, in Asia, even in a lot of Europe was really  the U.S. was increasing price, so you got double dip. You got a higher price and you got more subs during kind of the heyday. Outside the U.S., your price increase came from subscriber growth. And so, we have had to kind of retrain that market over the last two years by getting our content and our IP more important and by driving for price, and we've been successful with that. In some of the markets, Brazil was growing quite aggressively. In the last 18 months, two years, Brazil has actually lost 2 million subscribers. And so that's a function of the actual economy. The C class had accelerated, and then the disposable income had evaporated, and you actually  if some of that comes back, which a lot of people are predicting that it will over time, as Argentina's feeling better now, Colombia's feeling better, if Brazil makes the turn, that would be upside for us. We don't have that in our plan. Our plan is that the growth would be coming from primarily price. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC Great. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Cahall of Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now open. Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC Yeah. Thank you. Maybe just one on subs and then sorry for another one on the Olympics. Maybe first on the subs, I think in the press release, on domestic subs, you noted a slight decline, and then I thought in the comments, you noted a slight acceleration. So I wonder if you could just give us a little more color as to what you're seeing in the overall pay TV sub picture domestically. And then on the Olympic side, again, sorry to push you again, I think this is going to be a theme for the next few quarters. But, looking at your filings, I think your President of International had some new targets around the Olympics. When I sort of back into, if he's able to achieve those, it would suggest to me a margin on the Olympics that maybe looks a little bit like that double-digit you talked about for Eurosport before. Is that just getting way too exact way too early on, or is that a reasonable assumption for how to think about the games in 2018? David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. Yeah, so look, we're seeing  what Gunnar said is what we're seeing. We're seeing a slight acceleration on universe decline. We said we were on average about 3%, and for our bigger networks, it's actually less than that, and we have some pretty good protections against that. That's where most of our overwhelming amount of money comes from. Some of the smaller network, we actually saw meaningfully higher. So when you put it altogether, it was about 3%. That's in our plan. So this is not ahead of what our plan was for the year. If there was significant acceleration from that, then that would affect our plan, but we were doing a little bit better than planned last year, and so now we're kind of on it. So that's where we are on that. One point on the Olympics; the overwhelming majority of the value that we get is kind of what I would call long cycle sub-distribution revenue. We're holding back. In some markets, we're doing all of it. But, in a lot of markets, we're sub-distributing to a free-to-air player. We get guaranteed revenue. We've done that in multiple markets. We then hold back a significant amount of content for Eurosport, which we then sell. We then hold all the rights and we go direct-to-consumer. We could offer it as a whole package. We could do it by sport. But this is  the overwhelming majority of the dollars is sub-distribution revenue that's more long cycle that we'll be able to give you some visibility on, but we're ahead of plan on the deals that we've been doing. But it's too early to talk about the actual margins. But it's  not only do we think that we'll do nicely on it, but it also has helped us in the marketplace. It's helped us in terms of building up our overall distribution revenue. It's helped us in aligning with the federations; it's helped us with the IOC, with additional sports throughout Europe. So it's been a very  it's been a big positive and we're looking forward to it. Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente of Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open. Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet Thanks and good morning. I have two. First, for David, on the Eurosport Player, so David, you mentioned contributions from Eurosport. I mean, I suppose this might be for Gunnar as well. How many subs do you have? You talked last year, I think, about the March 2 (56:43) million subs. Just wondering broadly where we are. You gave us pretty robust growth rates of subs in your prepared remarks. And so what I'm getting to is, how many points of your international distribution growth is coming from the Eurosport Player? So you gave us the number of points from GO in the U.S. Just wondering right now how much of that growth is coming from Eurosport and then what's in your outlook for 2017 and beyond for contribution. And then, separately for Gunnar, the company struck this streaming joint venture partnership with ProSieben, your alma mater, I suppose. So what are the expectations for that product? You'll be competing with, let's say, Netflix and other subscription OTT services in the German market. Is this kind of ad supported OTT strategy something you think is specific for that market or is it a blueprint that you can potentially replicate in other geographies? Thank you. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. Thanks, Anthony. Look, we're adding a substantial amount of subs. We're doing a better job with churn, but what's most important for us is, directionally, we're figuring out what nourishes an audience, what people are willing to pay for, what excites them about the player, and what kind of a player we need to have a really competitive sports Netflix product to serve the 730 million potential opportunities we have across Europe. And one of the big learnings we had is our old player was only able to offer all the sports. And so by August of this year, maybe early September, we'll have our BAM, Major League Baseball product, deployed across Europe. That's going to be a huge difference for us, because one of the things we're finding is rather than people paying $8 to get a whole bunch of things, what they really would rather do is do a seasons pass. They'd rather pay $6 and get all the cycling, and then they could hit another button and they can get all the tennis or they can get all of the speed skating, or they can get all of the winter sports, or all the track and field, or all the squash. And so we've deployed a full team now that's operating out of the UK. This is a team that helped build not just the NFL package here in the U.S. with DIRECTV, but the NBA package. So we've hired a whole different group of people. And we haven't even launched our new player, which we'll be launching in the next couple of months. So are we doing a lot better? Yes. Is our churn doing better? Yes. But most of our success has come from the fact that we're learning that, instead of offering a magazine that offers a little bit of a whole bunch of sports, that we're better off going to these superfan groups. And over the next year, year and a half, we'll give you significant  much more information about how we're doing. We first want the player to launch. We'll be offering the Olympics. We'll be offering the Bundesliga. We'll be offering individual sports, which we've already started to do in Northern Europe and in certain markets. And right now, the affiliate growth is not in any meaningful way from the player. And we have a significant amount of cost that we're putting against it, because we've hired a lot of people and we really believe that that sports Netflix product is a game change for us. Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc. And Anthony, on that streaming JV, I'm very excited about that deal. I think it's a great JV in itself and it's even more opportunity and optionality for us going forward. So I think there is a desire for people and for consumers in the marketplace to have one destination where they can get most of the stuff they want to consume on an OTT basis, and I think we have done a great step towards that. ProSieben has an established seven TV platform with a strong installed base already, and we're leveraging that now. And I think there's a lot of optionality going forward. We're open to bringing on other players via broadcasters or some of the networks that are otherwise only available in pay TV. So, you can think about an SVOD option. You can think about integrating the Eurosport Player, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a ton of optionality and I'm very excited about that JV in the German market. And I clearly think that it can be replicated in other markets in Europe and that should be our aspiration as well. Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet Great. Thank you very much.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator And our first question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thank you very much. Just following up on your comments on domestic advertising trends, where you highlighted better pricing, I guess, any more color on the scatter market and how it's trending in the second quarter? And then, just a quick follow up on your commentary on your investment in short-form digital video that you highlighted. Can you add some color on how you expect to monetize it over time? Is it largely gaining mind share for the millennials and building up your brand? Or do you see, I guess, an incremental revenue opportunity associated with those videos as well? Thank you. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. Sure. Hi, Alexia. The advertising market kind of feels steady as she goes. We don't have a lot of visibility to the upfront, but scatter pricing is up mid-to-high teens over the upfront. The volume is relatively steady. We come into the market right now in the second quarter and into the upfront, I think, with a very compelling story. Our ratings are up. We're up in April in prime, up 5%, while the industry is down 8%. And for the full year-to-date, we're flat in prime with the industry down 6% and broadcast down 12%. But, more importantly, I think we're a very protected environment. Our brands have never been stronger. So not only do we have a growth story, but we have a real strength of viewership story on ID, on TLC, on Discovery, on OWN. And so, it's an environment the advertisers are quite comfortable with, and so I think that we're finding the market to be steady, and we're starting to take advantage of it with the quality of our brands and the fact that we actually have some real ratings. On the short-form monetization, the good news for us is that we're learning a ton. This whole Group Nine transaction has been terrific for us. We're building even stronger relationships with Facebook and Snapchat. We're understanding a lot more about the consumption of one minute videos. We're up to over 4 billion in views. We're the number one or two video provider for news on Facebook, and we're experimenting with them in different ways to monetize that. Guyardo is working with our entire team in putting Group Nine together with GO, together with our traditional inventory, so we have a great 360. And together with Snapchat, I feel like we're reaching more demos, a significant difference from two or three years ago where we felt like some of those demographics were being left behind and our story-telling capability in short-form, we felt like really needed to be improved. So we're quite happy with where we are. I think the monetization of short-form has a fairly long way to go. And so if there is upside there or if it takes a turn, we are now one of the  we're the number two or three provider of short-form content in terms of all the media companies, and we have a right to take control of Group Nine in two years. So I think it's been good and it's working very well with our ad sales team, and it gives us, I think, a very forward-looking view in terms of being able to reach all demos as we hit the upfront. Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hey, good morning. David, can you talk a little bit about your expectation? I believe your guidance is for acceleration in international distribution revenue growth later this year. And any update on sort of how you're thinking about the Bundesliga rights monetization. And I don't know if you guys are comfortable talking about through the Olympics next year, but to the extent you can help us think about distribution revenue trajectory into 2018. That would be really helpful. And Gunnar, I was just curious if you could  I don't know if you're willing to, but if you could give us the impact on U.S. distribution revenue from the year-over-year licensing change. I don't know if there's any  like a basis points impact or anything to help us isolate the core number. Thank you both. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. One point before I pass off to Gunnar who spent an enormous amount of time dealing with these issues in Germany and with ProSieben. One of our philosophies on our IP is that we own it on all platforms, which is meaningfully different from the way that sports is sold here in the U.S., for instance, where when you see it on a mobile player or on another platform, it might be the league that sells it, it might not  somebody's buying a broadcast window or a cable window. So when it comes to the Olympics and when it comes to the Bundesliga, when it comes to all of our sports rights, when it comes to almost all of our IP, we own it for all platforms. And so, if you see our content turning up or if you see the Olympic rings turning up with a mobile player in Europe, if you see the content over-the-top on mobile, on any platform, or the Bundesliga or any of our sports, that's why we can go direct-to-consumer with it, we could offer some of it free. And so, I think there's no question we're a little bit long on IP. We are profitable with our sports, but we're long on it because we think owning that IP for all platforms, owning our kids IP for all platforms, is part of the part of this transition we're making into creating real value to address some of the terminal value concerns that the industry's facing. Gunnar? Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc. Yeah, sure. Ben, good morning. So, on the affiliate revenue growth guidance for international, as you could hear in my opening remarks, we're continuing to target a 12% to 13% full year growth rate, and if you look at the run rates, as you say, we got 10% in Q1. I also said that we're going to see a slightly lower rate in Q2, which is not a change in the trend, but it's more related to a prior year comp where we had some catch up in Q2 2016. And then, as you say, we're targeting a pickup in the second half based on some deals that we're working on currently to get to that 12% to 13% figure for the full year. On Bundesliga specifically, maybe allow me one or two comments. As David said, I've lived in that market for all of my life, and really, it's important to understand Bundesliga is one of the top, top sports franchises in the market. We've got a good share of that. We own the rights for four years. It's a strong right and a good deal for us in terms of the duration. And looking at the number of players that are in the market that are looking for premium IP, we're talking to a number of players, and I'm absolutely convinced that the Bundesliga deal will help us strengthen the portfolio in the market. Talking about Bundesliga, again, from my perspective, a very interesting deal; I very much like that pan-European cross-platform approach to that deal. And again, I believe we will be able to create a lot of value, especially if you look at the eight-year period that we're looking at. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. For the Olympics. Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc. For the Olympics, yes. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. And the deals that we've done for the Olympics thus far have been ahead of plan. And by locking in those rights, we're excited about the fact that Germany is kind of the real center spoke of Europe, so not only do we have Eurosport free-to-air and pay in Germany, we have a free-to-air female channel, a free-to-air male channel, and we'll be doing the Olympics ourselves in Germany, which we think will add a significant amount of value, and having extra scale in Germany is important to us because it's such a robust market. Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc. And then, Ben, maybe your second question, the impact of those other distribution revenues on the U.S. side, we just felt it important to highlight that there were some contributions from those deals. It's small in the greater scheme of things in the whole distribution revenue line item. And we see more of those deals coming forward as we look at the full year. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. So that was really just some bulk delivery of content to our existing partners. It's a very small component of Q1, but when you add it on top, it provided some growth. So we felt it important to point that out and we may do more of those. Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Got it. Thank you, both. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC Thank you. Two  one following up on Ben and a new one. David, you guys been very clear about the Olympics in 2018 driving affiliate revenue growth internationally, it's going to step up. Could you talk a bit about how the costs layer in for the Olympics and is 2018 incrementally profitable because of those stepped up affiliate fees or is the Olympic profitability more back ended? And then, on the cost line, if you go back to your Investor Day in 2015, like almost two years ago, you guys talked about your ability to control costs under different scenarios of revenues. Now that we're two years later and you kind of see the normal rate of growth in the market, can you talk again about your ability to control cost and kind of what's the right way to think about domestic cost growth if this is the new normal of revenue growth? Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc. Okay. Michael, this is Gunnar. Let me take that. So, on the Olympics, it's still too early to really talk about the exact cadence of how the P&L impact will turn out. A couple of things that are clear from today's perspective is that the 2018 allocation of cost is going to be the lowest given that we don't have all the rights or not as many rights as in later years. So we will update our models and update you as soon as we have a reliable set of figures across those eight years. Generally speaking, the Winter Games are less expensive than the Summer Games, and we definitely see an upside from the Olympics deal generally on affiliate revenues. As a matter of fact, you can already see European affiliate revenues going back to double-digit without even having factored in all the sports rights. And we also, obviously, see contributions from our Eurosport Player. (37:10) David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. The cadence that Gunnar was talking about is simply that we got all the rights for eight years, but in the UK and in France, we didn't get the Olympic rights until 2022 and 2024, but we did structure a deal with the BBC, whereas part of their rights to carry the Olympics, we got a substantial amount of rights and extensive digital rights in 2020 and 2022. But when you allocate the actual fees, because of France and the UK, the cadence is a little bit different, that's all. Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc. And then, Michael, on the cost guidance, I think, looking at the Q1 numbers, you see that the company is very focused on cost management. Clearly, coming in, I will continue that focus and take a fresh look at cost as well, but I must say I'm very happy with the performance that Discovery has delivered on the cost side in Q1. So, the general guidance for us for 2017, as I said before, is total company organic cost of revenues up high-single to low-double digits, and we will be even more restrictive on SG&A on a total company level targeting flat-to-low single digit increases for our cost base. So please be assured it will continue to be a clear focus of the management team here. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. And Michael, just to confirm our company but also my full engagement in social media, I was following the hundreds of notes and likes for your birthday yesterday on Facebook, as well as the numerous picture posts, all of which I thought were very nice. Happy birthday. Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC Thanks, David. Thank you. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield of BTIG. Your line is now open. Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC Hi, thanks for taking the question. AT&T's Randall Stephenson was testifying before Congress late last year, and he said point-blank to Congress that he said a huge number of consumers want cheaper video bundles without the high cost of sports. And David, you've talked to the rise of these new virtual MVPDs as an opportunity. So far, they seem all very sports heavy, including kind of, as a basis, the broadcasters and the RSNs, which push not only the cost towards $40, but it also has led to Discovery and others being left out of things like Hulu and YouTube launches. Wondering what do you think of the prospects are for new bundles that may not have the broadcasters or may not have the RSNs that could be priced below $20. And then I have a follow-up on Group Nine. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. Thanks, Rich. Well, first, I think, ultimately, consumer behavior and consumer consumption is what drives the capitalist market. So you can develop a channel, but you have to create content that people want to get nourished by. So you can sit in a conference room and say what you want to provide people. Ultimately, the consumer is the one that is always the determining winner. And you look at outside the U.S.  outside the U.S., there have been very successful skinny bundles. We're on all of them. We have quality content with strong brands that are valued. Our cost of content is relatively low. And we've done extremely well on all of those skinny bundles all over the world, in Latin America, in Eastern Europe and Europe, and each of them have been in the very low price range. And even when there is sports, sports is just hyper-extended here in the U.S. reflected in regional sports, traditional sports. Retransmission can extend the integration of sports with other channels. And so this is a bit of a stuffed turkey here, and in many ways, when I read about the skinny bundle here in the U.S., I see the skinny bundle in 200 countries. When I look here in the U.S. and I read skinny bundle, there is no skinny bundle here. Skinny bundle in the U.S. is a fiction. The idea that you have a $40 offering filled with regional sports, sports and all these  an incomplete package, really, and then you have to buy broadband on top of it, so the skinny bundle is $60 or $70. So it's really not a skinny bundle. It's a bundle. It's a bundle that may be attractive to a small group of people. But, in the end, I think the market will be rationalized. We represent 12% or 13% of viewership. We have the top channel for women in ID, the number one channel for men in Discovery, top channel in Middle America with TLC, a top channel for African Americans with Oprah and Tyler, and our cost of content is low. We are on DIRECTV NOW. We're on Sony. We're on many of the platforms. But, ultimately, there should be a bundle like everywhere else in the world that's $8, $10, $12. And I believe that will happen. I think these overstuffed turkeys are going to end up being a challenge from a consumer perspective, and the consumer's going to say, I'd like to have an opportunity here. And in many ways, Netflix is a terrific company, and they continue to be very effective, and so does Amazon, but we as an industry need to complement that with a quality offering that isn't  that's a true skinny bundle in the spirit of what's working around the world, and I think that'll happen. It's just a question of when. Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC And just wanted to follow up on Group Nine. I think you mentioned 4-plus billion, I lost the exact number, but 4-plus billion views is what you're getting across a variety of online mobile platforms. Is that a business that at that scale is generating profits or is that a business that's still losing money? Or like, is there any way to size kind of the revenues and whether it's profitable or not? David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. Well, it's not profitable, but it's pretty close, and our overall approach right now  it's run by Ben Lerer, who's doing a terrific job there. We put some of our assets into it. When we closed on it, it was $3 billion. Now it's $4.2 billion. We continue to learn about what engages people. We have great analytics. So I think that it helped us lean into our understanding of what kind of content we could provide for Snapchat. It's informing the way we tell stories, the kind of stories. And so this pivot to mobile is quite important for us. As we look at over $7 billion screens out there, we're the leader in traditional platform on linear around the world, and we own all of our content so we can move a lot of our long-form content. But being able to repackage with The Dodo, we have Animal Planet, which is a leader around the world, and now we have The Dodo, which is the leader now in short-form animal content on the web. And so being able to own those different areas are critical. We're not focused today on making money. We're focused on learning. We're focused on getting more scale. We're focused on building our relationship with Snapchat, with Facebook, with all of the different outlets out there, and have millennials kind of really get nourished and excited about what we're doing. And in the long term, we're hopeful that they'll be a meaningful currency, and we're actually working with Facebook now on different ways that we can do that, which I think is in both of our interests. Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open. Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi, good morning. I'm following along for my colleagues across the various revenue lines. I guess maybe I'll tackle international advertising, if I may, especially since you guys probably have the best view of that of pretty much any company I know. So, I guess I'd frame my question this way. If you think about sort of the run rate that you are at this quarter and have been for a while, and compare that back to the Investor Day, which your expectations, I think, were somewhat higher, trying to figure out like what's caused that delta? How much of it is cyclical? How much of it is structural? How much of it is geopolitical? And are we basically at a new reality now where the run rate we're seeing is kind of the run rate going forward? And just a quick follow-on related is we've talked about the Olympics in many ways. Nobody's asked yet about Olympics advertising. Again, I don't know what you're prepared to comment on, but it's only a year away for the Winter Games, which is a big geography for you. Any help you can give on advertising perspective, just the magnitude of that box as we're thinking of where the health could be there? Thanks. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. Okay. Thanks, Todd. On the advertising side, look, we  in Europe, we really haven't gotten help in 11 years. GDP across Europe, if you take out the UK, has been effectively flat, and the advertising follows GDP. So we've been able to grow despite that. But there have been some geopolitical issues. There's no question. You have the UK down 4% and Brexit has had a meaningful impact on the UK. That's a big market for us. There was a restructure in Russia. We're one of the leading players in Russia. We were the first ones that were brought back. Many of the media companies that want to get into Russia now have to go through our media partnership. But Russia changed because we can only own 20% of it. There are values that we can get outside of the 20%, but things changed there. So, in mainland Europe, we're doing quite well. We're growing in  outside of the UK and Asia, we're growing in every market. And Latin America is growing high-single digit now, but it was growing 20%, 30%. So the fact that Brazil kind of tipped and Argentina has struggled for a while, and Mexico is having some challenges is having an impact, but we're still seeing high-single digit growth in Latin America. We're still seeing growth across all of Europe. Some of that has to do with the fact that our share is growing, and our brands are stronger, but we expect that that will continue, and we're used to doing business in a difficult environment. The other thing that we're seeing is Asia is tough, and it's likely to be tougher. In some ways, we have a smaller business in India, but I'm glad we have a smaller business in India because the demonetization has been a struggle. The recovery from that demonetization has been longer than expected. We got a report out this morning and yesterday from the team over there now. It looks like things are slow and there's a government regulation regime that looks like it may be coming down in India, that's going to put a damper on a lot of the growth that was assumed to be coming out of there. The good news for us is that's going to have a very minimal effect on us. So I think our positioning of being big Europe, quite strong in Italy and Germany and across all of Europe with real scale, together with strong positioning in Latin America probably puts us in as good of a position as we could be in. I wouldn't want to overweight in Asia right now. And the other Asia issue is just being the potential, and we're looking at doing this, of just jumping right over in many of these markets traditional distribution and going direct-to-consumer, which is what we're looking at doing in a lot of the areas in Asia. We're entrenched in a very good business in Japan, but it's not growing that much, and a lot of other areas of Asia, we're actually going to  we're going to take all of our IP and we're going direct. So, I like our combination. It's certainly not robust. I would say steady eddy, and I wouldn't expect that things are going to get much better. I hope we don't have more Brexits. I think the France thing helps us. Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc. And Todd, maybe if I can add one point to that discussion, I think if you take a step back, you referred to the 2015 mid-term guidance, right? Yes, advertising has been somewhat slower, affiliate has been slightly stronger, and if you look at the total company guidance, EPS, free cash flow guidance has even been raised after. Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Fair point. Thanks. Any comment on the Olympics while we're on this or not? Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc. Yeah, so as I said before, it's really too early to give you any specific numbers, but I feel very strong about the Olympics deal. We have all kinds of monetization opportunities: sub-licensing, affiliate, advertising. We have complete rights, all platforms. So we'll be able to cover literally every moment of the games on air, online, over-the-top, on-the-go. So I think there's a lot of opportunity for us, but please understand, it's just too early to give you any specific guidance there. Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC Thank you. This is David Joyce for Vijay. Could you please help us think about the distribution opportunity internationally? Obviously, you've talked a lot around your over-the-top and direct-to-consumer opportunities, but with the increasing penetration around the globe of the pay TV footprint, how should we think about growth in the different regions? Thank you. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. Sure. What we've seen is, across Europe, we'd expect it to be relatively flat, maybe even slightly We pivoted. We pulled our signal four times in the last 18 months, so most of our growth now is coming from price. We're being helped by sports. In Latin America, a lot of our growth is coming from price, which is really a change. If you look at the last 15 years, the majority of growth in Latin America, in Asia, even in a lot of Europe was really  the U.S. was increasing price, so you got double dip. You got a higher price and you got more subs during kind of the heyday. Outside the U.S., your price increase came from subscriber growth. And so, we have had to kind of retrain that market over the last two years by getting our content and our IP more important and by driving for price, and we've been successful with that. In some of the markets, Brazil was growing quite aggressively. In the last 18 months, two years, Brazil has actually lost 2 million subscribers. And so that's a function of the actual economy. The C class had accelerated, and then the disposable income had evaporated, and you actually  if some of that comes back, which a lot of people are predicting that it will over time, as Argentina's feeling better now, Colombia's feeling better, if Brazil makes the turn, that would be upside for us. We don't have that in our plan. Our plan is that the growth would be coming from primarily price. David Joyce - Evercore Group LLC Great. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Cahall of Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now open. Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC Yeah. Thank you. Maybe just one on subs and then sorry for another one on the Olympics. Maybe first on the subs, I think in the press release, on domestic subs, you noted a slight decline, and then I thought in the comments, you noted a slight acceleration. So I wonder if you could just give us a little more color as to what you're seeing in the overall pay TV sub picture domestically. And then on the Olympic side, again, sorry to push you again, I think this is going to be a theme for the next few quarters. But, looking at your filings, I think your President of International had some new targets around the Olympics. When I sort of back into, if he's able to achieve those, it would suggest to me a margin on the Olympics that maybe looks a little bit like that double-digit you talked about for Eurosport before. Is that just getting way too exact way too early on, or is that a reasonable assumption for how to think about the games in 2018? David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. Yeah, so look, we're seeing  what Gunnar said is what we're seeing. We're seeing a slight acceleration on universe decline. We said we were on average about 3%, and for our bigger networks, it's actually less than that, and we have some pretty good protections against that. That's where most of our overwhelming amount of money comes from. Some of the smaller network, we actually saw meaningfully higher. So when you put it altogether, it was about 3%. That's in our plan. So this is not ahead of what our plan was for the year. If there was significant acceleration from that, then that would affect our plan, but we were doing a little bit better than planned last year, and so now we're kind of on it. So that's where we are on that. One point on the Olympics; the overwhelming majority of the value that we get is kind of what I would call long cycle sub-distribution revenue. We're holding back. In some markets, we're doing all of it. But, in a lot of markets, we're sub-distributing to a free-to-air player. We get guaranteed revenue. We've done that in multiple markets. We then hold back a significant amount of content for Eurosport, which we then sell. We then hold all the rights and we go direct-to-consumer. We could offer it as a whole package. We could do it by sport. But this is  the overwhelming majority of the dollars is sub-distribution revenue that's more long cycle that we'll be able to give you some visibility on, but we're ahead of plan on the deals that we've been doing. But it's too early to talk about the actual margins. But it's  not only do we think that we'll do nicely on it, but it also has helped us in the marketplace. It's helped us in terms of building up our overall distribution revenue. It's helped us in aligning with the federations; it's helped us with the IOC, with additional sports throughout Europe. So it's been a very  it's been a big positive and we're looking forward to it. Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente of Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open. Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet Thanks and good morning. I have two. First, for David, on the Eurosport Player, so David, you mentioned contributions from Eurosport. I mean, I suppose this might be for Gunnar as well. How many subs do you have? You talked last year, I think, about the March 2 (56:43) million subs. Just wondering broadly where we are. You gave us pretty robust growth rates of subs in your prepared remarks. And so what I'm getting to is, how many points of your international distribution growth is coming from the Eurosport Player? So you gave us the number of points from GO in the U.S. Just wondering right now how much of that growth is coming from Eurosport and then what's in your outlook for 2017 and beyond for contribution. And then, separately for Gunnar, the company struck this streaming joint venture partnership with ProSieben, your alma mater, I suppose. So what are the expectations for that product? You'll be competing with, let's say, Netflix and other subscription OTT services in the German market. Is this kind of ad supported OTT strategy something you think is specific for that market or is it a blueprint that you can potentially replicate in other geographies? Thank you. David M. Zaslav - Discovery Communications, Inc. Thanks, Anthony. Look, we're adding a substantial amount of subs. We're doing a better job with churn, but what's most important for us is, directionally, we're figuring out what nourishes an audience, what people are willing to pay for, what excites them about the player, and what kind of a player we need to have a really competitive sports Netflix product to serve the 730 million potential opportunities we have across Europe. And one of the big learnings we had is our old player was only able to offer all the sports. And so by August of this year, maybe early September, we'll have our BAM, Major League Baseball product, deployed across Europe. That's going to be a huge difference for us, because one of the things we're finding is rather than people paying $8 to get a whole bunch of things, what they really would rather do is do a seasons pass. They'd rather pay $6 and get all the cycling, and then they could hit another button and they can get all the tennis or they can get all of the speed skating, or they can get all of the winter sports, or all the track and field, or all the squash. And so we've deployed a full team now that's operating out of the UK. This is a team that helped build not just the NFL package here in the U.S. with DIRECTV, but the NBA package. So we've hired a whole different group of people. And we haven't even launched our new player, which we'll be launching in the next couple of months. So are we doing a lot better? Yes. Is our churn doing better? Yes. But most of our success has come from the fact that we're learning that, instead of offering a magazine that offers a little bit of a whole bunch of sports, that we're better off going to these superfan groups. And over the next year, year and a half, we'll give you significant  much more information about how we're doing. We first want the player to launch. We'll be offering the Olympics. We'll be offering the Bundesliga. We'll be offering individual sports, which we've already started to do in Northern Europe and in certain markets. And right now, the affiliate growth is not in any meaningful way from the player. And we have a significant amount of cost that we're putting against it, because we've hired a lot of people and we really believe that that sports Netflix product is a game change for us. Gunnar Wiedenfels - Discovery Communications, Inc. And Anthony, on that streaming JV, I'm very excited about that deal. I think it's a great JV in itself and it's even more opportunity and optionality for us going forward. So I think there is a desire for people and for consumers in the marketplace to have one destination where they can get most of the stuff they want to consume on an OTT basis, and I think we have done a great step towards that. ProSieben has an established seven TV platform with a strong installed base already, and we're leveraging that now. And I think there's a lot of optionality going forward. We're open to bringing on other players via broadcasters or some of the networks that are otherwise only available in pay TV. So, you can think about an SVOD option. You can think about integrating the Eurosport Player, et cetera, et cetera. So there's a ton of optionality and I'm very excited about that JV in the German market. And I clearly think that it can be replicated in other markets in Europe and that should be our aspiration as well. Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet Great. Thank you very much.

Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC Scott Moritz - Bloomberg News Ben Markus - Colorado Public Radio Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US) Operator Good day and welcome to the DISH Network Corporation Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jason Kiser. Please go ahead, sir. Jason Kiser - DISH Network Corp. Thanks, Isaac. Well, thanks for joining us. This is Jason Kiser, Treasurer here at DISH Network. Joined today by Charlie Ergen, our Chairman and CEO; Tom Cullen, EVP of Corporate Development; Roger Lynch, CEO of Sling TV; Erik Carlson, President of DISH Network; Steve Swain, our CFO; Paul Orban, our Controller; and Stan Dodge, our General Counsel. We're going to open it up for Q&A, but we do need to do our Safe Harbor disclosures. So for that, we'll turn it over to Stan. R. Stanton Dodge - DISH Network Corp. Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We ask that media representatives not identify participants or their firms in your reports. We also do not allow audio-taping and ask that you respect that. All statements we make during this call that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from historical results and from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For a list of those factors, please refer to the front of our 10-K. All cautionary statements that we make during this call should be understood as being applicable to any forward-looking statements that we make wherever they appear. You should carefully consider the risks described in our reports and should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements which we assume no responsibility for updating. And with that out of the way, I'm going to turn it over to our CFO, Steve Swain. Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp. Thanks, Stan. During the first quarter, DISH completed a transaction with EchoStar which was (01:30). EchoStar transferred to us certain assets and operations of the EchoStar technologies and EchoStar broadcasting businesses. These businesses and their associated IP design, develop and distribute set-top boxes, provide satellite uplinking services and develop streaming video technologies. In addition, we received investments in high frequency spectrum bonuses, joint ventures such as NagraStar (01:57), certain real estate, as well as the remaining 10% interest in Sling TV. In exchange, we transferred to EchoStar our tracking stock, representing an 80% economic interest in the Hughes residential retail satellite broadband business. We believe that this transaction will give DISH more direct control over the product development of our Pay-TV business, which includes Sling TV and it is projected to be modestly accretive to free cash flow due to the elimination of EchoStar's profit margin as well as other efficiency initiatives. Because the transaction was between entities that are under common control, accounting rules require us to recast our numbers as of the earliest period presented to include the impact of this transaction. The impact of recasting the first quarter of 2016 increased our equipment revenue by $40 million primarily due to international set-top box sales to third-parties. Our next income increased by $10.6 million primarily due to the margin on those international equipment sales and the elimination of the margin on the transferred products and services we previously purchased from EchoStar. To build your financial models, the 2016 recasted income statements by quarter are presented in the MD&A section of our 10-Q. Regarding the balance sheet, the transferred assets were recorded at net book value and the tracking stock was removed with the difference booked (03:32) capital. Also similar to the P&L, we adjusted PP&E and inventory to remove the set-top box and accessories margin which we had previously paid to EchoStar. Separately, during the quarter, we entered into an agreement which Hughes, which allows us to market and install the Hughes broadband service. Hughes will make certain payments to us for each sale and installation. Please note, subscribers acquired under this agreement will be Hughes branded retail subscribers and therefore, will not be included in our broadband subscriber count. As a result, our broadband subscriber count related to the Hughes service will decline through customer attrition. More broadly, with only wholesale economics, we believe this is the right time for us economically and for our Pay-TV customers to pivot away from the wholesale model. A model in which we pay acquisition costs but has significantly lower margins relative to our competitors. For additional information, please see our 10-Q that was filed this morning. With that, Isaac, we will now open up the call for, first, analyst Q&A and then media Q&A. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Perfect. Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi, guys. Thanks. Two, if I can. Charlie, can you talk about your spectrum strategy going into the auction and how you ended up? How does having the 600 megahertz spectrum change the value of the overall portfolio? And then second for Steve. Can you quantify for us the litigation impact from the first quarter that impacted G&A? Thank you. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Okay. Phil, it's Charlie. I'll take the first part. You never know what an auction is going to do. So  but our strategy going in, first, we thought it would go for materially higher than it did. But our strategy was to get one nationwide block of low-band spectrum because it does so many other things for our spectrum portfolio. Obviously, 600 low-band propagates farther. So in terms of penetration through walls and basements and things for your signal, that was an important part of where we were trying to go. Second, when you start looking at the Internet of Things and all the devices you're going be connecting in the future, low-band is ideal for Internet of Things and that technology is going to change quite a bit with 5G and so there's a focus there. We were pleasantly surprised that as the auction went on, it became clear at the end of the  the first round or the second round that the price was not going up; that it was going stay sub-$20 billion based on our projections. And we felt that was probably in excess of $0.50 on the dollar in terms of real value for the spectrum. So we were then able to not only get our nationwide spectrum but also then to stay in the bigger cities where we felt that the  particularly the Internet of Things would be beneficial. So one of the things about auctions today is that the way the FCC does it it's based on population. So everything  every analyst and everything, I always quote megahertz per pop. But the last several auctions, we've kind of looked at where we think things are going and we look at it on megahertz per thing, not megahertz per pop or megahertz per microprocessor. So whether it'd be streetlights or heart monitors or automobiles or drones or whatever, we've always looked at it as a megahertz per thing. And when you do that, obviously the more densely populated cities are quite a bit of a bargain discount, if you believe our theory is right on that. So that was the strategy. We were pleasantly surprised. Pleased to be one of two companies that got nationwide blocks in the auction. So, Steve? Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp. Yes. Phil, so unfortunately, I can't quantify the litigation impact because these settlements were confidential. I can say that even without the litigation impacts, we would have been down year-over-year on the G&A line. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thanks, Steve. Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp. Sure. Operator And we'll take our next question from Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Please go ahead. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC Thanks. Charlie, when the FCC made the decision on the designated entity bidding credits, I think you had mentioned something like they obviously don't want us to be a competitor and maybe look to sell it and I think at the time, you might have even talked about, Jason breaking up or looking at ways to have those assets in different buckets. Now that you've come away with this 600 megahertz band, I mean, it's a more complete package, has your view on that changed? And should we rule out the possibility of you selling any of this stuff in pieces and this is more kind of a do something with it in its entirety or  and only if someone's willing to pay for it in its entirety, would you actually willing to sell it? Thanks. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. I guess on the AWS-3 auction where we obviously participated with two designated entities, I think at least we were  at least myself personally, beyond depressed when the FCC ruled that they would disallow the discounts, because I knew that we had followed the rules and the precedent that  and every other company had taken  all of our competitors taken advantage of the discounts in such a massive auction. But obviously, the number was quite big but, on a relative basis, it really wasn't just anything historical, and it's no different. And then at the same time, you have an auction of airways for broadcasters where the government gave them spectrum for free and they just walked away with $10 billion and not a word is said about the fact that broadcasters walked away with $10 billion of profits for something they got for free and we were buying spectrum. So, to me, I don't believe it was fair. And probably more disconcerting, we were never allowed to come into the FCC and to the extent they had issues with it to work through those issues with the FCC so that the outcome was fair. So obviously that's in litigation today. That's in front of the courts. The courts will decide whether the FCC followed within jurisdiction or whether they didn't. And we'll live  who knows how long that will go on. But look we're going live with  you can always have honest disagreements. We have an honest disagreement with the past administration on that one. And we'll see what the courts come through. Having said that, we aren't giving up and we didn't give up and we're not giving up. And so we're really pleased to strengthen our spectrum position and our strategic position and we're not going to rule anything out and we're not going to rule anything in. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC Okay. So even though it's a more complete package now, you don't rule out  in certain situations, if someone wanted to buy a piece of the package that you would consider that as well? Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Well, I mean, I think that there are  look, I think there's interesting parts in this auction. I think it's  I don't want to speak for AT&T, but it's pretty clear that they didn't bid  I don't believe they placed a bid of any consequence after the first round. And obviously with their  excuse me, first stage. And obviously, with their selection in the FirstNet sweepstakes, that may be a lower priority to them. So there's people perhaps that are in this auction that have other strategic interest and there's certainly things that could happen where you can see, just like in football, somebody's got a good tight end and somebody needs a defensive back and you can see things happening with any number of companies. But you got to have a portfolio to play there. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC Okay. Understood. And I think Rich wants to try and pin you down on a Sling number. Standby. Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC So and, Charlie, last month comScore reported that Sling subs, if you include both domestic and international subscribers to at least one of your Sling packages, was something like 700,000 in July of 2016 and moved all the way up to 1.9 million by the end of 2016. Curious if that type of dramatic acceleration in Sling actually happened in the latter half of 2016 and what drove it. And just from a higher level, I guess, is it now conceivable that Sling, in some form, domestic, international, that that represents upwards of 15% of overall DISH video subscribers. Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp. Hey, Rich. It's Roger. I'm going to field this one. Just on your second one, we don't break out Sling numbers separately, so can't answer that. Certainly, the second half of the year is a strong content time of year for us given all of the college and NFL football that occurs. So seasonally, we traditionally see stronger growth during the last four months of the year than we do in other periods of similar length throughout the year. So we can't comment on specific numbers but that is a seasonally strong period for us. Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC And the other services that have launched haven't notably changed the trajectory of Sling, meaning competitors? Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp. The other services that have launched have all really been big bundle OTT services, so largely replicating traditional Pay-TV packages. And so when I look at our portfolio with Sling Orange, which is at $20, the closest competitor really is about 75% higher price point, plus we have this ability to pick and choose the genres you want to add on, or our Sling Blue service, which, at $25, is quite attractive, has a lot of content in it. And obviously it doesn't have ESPN in it. We know a lot of people like ESPN but there are people who don't want to pay for ESPN. And so that gives us a cost advantage for that package compared to some of the other big bundles  for that service, sorry, compared to those other big bundles. Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC Thanks very much. Operator And we'll take our next question from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC Great. Thanks. Charlie, could you talk about your view on the sort of timing of the 5G rollout in the United States and sort of your view on how the technology is progressing? And then secondly, the big carriers seem to be focusing on the millimeter wave portion of the spectrum, whereas you're focused more on the sort of low and mid band. One, do you think their focus on the very high frequencies is misplaced? And where do you think the bulk of the heavy lifting on 5G will take place? Thanks. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Yeah. So I mean, there's  and there's a lot of misconception about 5G but I think I want to now  if you've ever watched Spinal Tap, I want to announce here first and foremost that we're going turn the volume up to 11 and we're going for  we're going to build out 11G and we're just going to go from 5G to 11G. And obviously, I'm being facetious that the 5G standard is not set yet so there's  you're not going to see true 5G until 2020 and probably 2021 in terms of 5G. And the main things that  5G is going to  it does a couple things, but one is much lower latency, which brings in things like autonomous vehicles, health care and things into a network that maybe won't work ideally on existing networks. It certainly brings in Internet of Things in a way that with millions of devices it can connect at one time that you really can't do on existing infrastructure today. And of course, obviously it's more  it's going to bring 10, 20, 100 times more capacity in certain areas and adds things like millimeter wave technology. So it is a very transitional, it is a very big paradigm shift. And I think from a marketing people  marketing thing, people are going to want  jump the gun and call things 5G, but I don't think, you're  as an American consumer you're going to get anything truly 5G standard, just the total standard, until at least 2020. As far as millimeter wave technology, I think it's very interesting technology. We have believed that for long time. We participated in the auction, the 28-gig auction. Gosh, it's been like 15 years ago, so we own four cities of 28-gig technology. But we also participated in MVDDS auction with 12-gig frequencies and that we have in most of the major cities in the United States and we're part of the MVDDS coalition that we believe that is the way for the government to add another 500 megahertz of spectrum that can be used for terrestrial use. We use that for satellite today. And we've worked with both the past and the current administrations to explain how that can help fund some of the spectrum gap out there. So we're hopeful that  we just missed getting on the rulemaking for spectrum frontiers last time. We'll hope that the current administration will put that spectrum on public notice or in the rulemaking, so that people can comment. But that's certainly a place for the government to add another 500 megahertz of spectrum. And again, it's technically centimeter wave technology. It has better propagation technique  characteristics than 28-gig does and you can imagine a lot of uses in the spectrum deficit, how you could use that. So I think we're very well positioned, if higher frequencies find a home, we think we're well positioned there. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Thanks. Operator And we'll take our next question from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Thanks. Two questions. So first, Charlie, just following up on the timing question. Can you talk about how some of the build-out requirements impact your decision on moving ahead with the spectrum build-out? And whether or not you feel that with a potential consolidation on the carrier side, namely T-Mobile and Sprint, if you feel like that leads you to any urgency to make a decision one way or the other? And then, Steve, can you talk about the ARPU impact from Sling TV and how we should think about the mix impact on total ARPU? Thank you. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Okay, Amy, on the build-out, one of the things I learned long ago is we focus on the things we can control. So while there's going be a lot of noise and there's certainly going to be talk of consolidation and lots of rumors about this company and that company doing something together, the one thing we can control is our build-out. And we have committed to the FCC that we will build out a narrow-band to IoT network to perfect our license by March of 2020. Because of our spectrum position with the different bands we have, now with 600 megahertz in the mix as well, there are several different ways we could build that network out. Ideally, we'd like to build out 600 in the IoT network. But because of the 39-month clearing schedule, it's possible that to meet that deadline in March of 2020 that we can't necessarily use 600 in the way that we'd like to do it because that's a great frequency for that. So Tom and his team are now meeting with the vendors and we're also talking to the industry about what they want to see in an IoT network. And then we'll make some decisions later this year as to the frequencies that we're going to build out and then start the planning process and then start to build probably  we got to get  we have to get equipment and then start to build late next year and complete it by March of 2020. So that's the one thing we can control. We feel like our balance sheet can support that build. We believe that that's what we control. In the meantime, I think obviously there's  in terms of the industry, I think there certainly will be a lot of discussions between people in the industry, potentially people outside the industry. Certainly, the potential of lighter regulatory in this administration could lead to some consolidation in ways that maybe weren't contemplated in the previous administration. And we have a tremendous set of assets at DISH. And it's our job as management to put those assets to work in the most economic long-term model that makes sense for our shareholders and for our customers. And that's what we'll do. Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp. Yes, Amy. For ARPU, you're right. Sling TV subscribers on average purchase the lower-price programming compared to DBS. So therefore, as Sling TV subscribers increase, the weighted average Pay-TV ARPU will be lower. For DBS, we are seeing some subscribers shift to smaller, less expense packaging, commonly, as you know, known as cord shaving. Seeing that these customers want less robust packages, we did add Flex Pack, which is a skinny bundle option. And while the Flex Pack adds pressure to ARPU growth on the DBS side, we believe the function of Flex Pack as a churn-reducing save tactic increases margins in the instances where we had previously offered customers loyalty credits. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Got it. Thank you. Operator And we'll take our next question from Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead. Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group Great, thank you. Two questions. First, on the changing competitive dynamic in video, what we saw in the quarter or last quarter was DIRECTV didn't add subs for the first time in about six quarters due perhaps to higher churn because their subscribers are going to cable bundled with broadband and I guess over the top. So are you guys seeing anything incremental in terms of the competitive dynamic? And are you seeing Sling getting more subs from DIRECTV satellite? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Yeah. This is Charlie. I think your thesis is generally correct and I think we've been talking about that for at least five years, that that's kind of what we foresaw that the bundle  there's a lot of dynamics, but the bundle where programmers had a lot of leverage over the distribution path and you're forced to take not one or two channels or the top three rated channels from an event. But you may take 11, 12, 15 channels of which 10 of them maybe you don't really want, but you got to pass those costs onto consumers. And the second dynamic is retransmission consent has gone up thousands of percent to the point where the cost of your local networks now exceed, for the most part, almost every channel but ESPN. And that dynamic is such that  and in all these cases, the ratings of the particular networks, for the most part, have gone down. And in the broadcasters' case, they've gone down significantly. So that's a dynamic that pushes people away from Pay-TV all together. And for those who stay in Pay-TV, they're going to go down to lower-cost alternatives. Less advertising, more binge viewing and the kind of things that have led to the rise of things like Netflix. So that's the dynamic that's out there. So one of the things that we've done is in recognizing those trends; obviously, we have pivoted the company to a connectivity company and have tried to invest in those things that we think have long-term returns and invest less in our traditional business. So we're less likely to invest in a DBS subscriber in Boston, Massachusetts, where they've got good Internet connection from multiple sources who have an advantage in bundling both broadband and potentially OTT video. Roger then set on task  it's been almost six years now that Roger was set the course to come up with product that would be meaningful to consumers in that environment. So we think that we're well-positioned there. We think we're disciplined. We think that despite the fact that analysts and headlines are about sub loss or sub gain or this ARPU or that ARPU or this quarter or that quarter, we think we're very well-disciplined to take the  one of the few companies that can take a long-term view of it and say we're not afraid to change. We see the change happening and how do we take advantage of the change in a way that perhaps our competitors aren't doing or are slow to react or want to hold onto what they have but aren't really going to where the future is. And so it's difficult. There's course studies in MBA schools. There's a book written about it in terms of the entrepreneur's dilemma or whatever it's called, and we're living that every day. I forget the other part of the question. Was it - Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp. ...competitor impact. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Yeah, Roger, can you address it? Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp. Yeah, it's Roger. I'd say, well, one thing I've noticed is with the launch of these other OTT services, starting with DIRECTV NOW, they are bigger bundle packages. And so we're seeing Sling customers increasingly taking more add-on packs. So it may be a different class of customers coming into the market spurred by the big bundles that have launched in OTT. But we're definitely seeing customers who are taking more add-on packs that is certainly correlated with that. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Yeah, and this is Charlie. I think strategically when we started Sling, we were not looking to replace the cable bundle. We were not looking to take a cable subscriber or for that matter a satellite subscriber and suddenly convert them into an OTT because that was adding SAC to get the same customer. So that has not been our primary objective. Having said that, it appears that where Hulu and YouTube and DIRECTV NOW and Sony are, that they all are basically replicating the cable bundle. And so there's no question now that it's game on to convert a cable subscriber to an OTT subscriber for essentially the same services. So all those guys have, example, the Disney products with ESPN, which is, as you know, one of the most costly. And yet, studies show and we know from our own internal data that the vast majority of people do not actually watch ESPN particularly year-round. So you're ending up at  so that maybe there's a different strategy in there that works long term. If everybody's going north, maybe you should go northwest in life. Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group Well, looking - Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Maybe not. Maybe you should go north, but maybe you should go northwest. So my point is that I think the OTT model probably initially is going be a license to lose money for people as they price things below cost. Eventually, it'll sort its way out. And there'll probably be several different strategies within the OTT world. And Roger and his team are well-acquainted with potential avenues they could take. Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group Well, in that vein, Charlie, OTT services to me seem like they're frenemies, right? So they compete with each other but they also  if they get together, they can change the market and they can grow it, right? Do you see a tipping point that's going to be particularly notable as they cannibalize  they go from cannibalizing each other to taking more share away from Pay-TV? Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Well, my belief is that OTT will take share away from Pay-TV. So satellite and cable will be smaller five years from now than they are today. And so satellite, you're already seeing that reduction, right, and satellite and phone companies, you've seen reductions really for the last couple of years. Cable, I think, with the strength of broadband has been able to kind of tread water and I think actually potentially gain some subs. And I think ultimately that will reverse too and that you will see a natural evolution to an OTT product because OTT in many ways can be a superior product. It can be less expensive and it can be superior. The question's going be what do those OTT bundles look like and how chopped up does the consumer get because he's going to have a lot more choice. And when he has more choice, he's going to go different directions. And meanwhile, obviously, Amazon and Netflix continue to grow. So it's a very interesting dynamic. The one thing I know  the reason I sleep at night pretty well is that all those people have one thing in common. They need to be connected. They need connectivity for those customers to receive video. And we know, Roger knows that the vast majority of sessions for people who are taking OTT services are actually not on your TV screen but on mobile devices. So that means that you need wireless spectrum to connect, right? And so that's one point. Second point I'd make is you're in a regulatory environment where the current administration has said they're not in favor of  I don't want to put words in their mouth. But I think, correct me if I'm wrong, they're not really in favor of Title II. They're going to do a rule-making on net neutrality and that there's probably a lighter regulatory touch with that, which I would think to mean that the balance of power between distribution and content owners gets a little bit more level. Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group Super. Thank you. Operator And we'll take our next question from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI Thanks. Charlie, based on your last comment, so are you sort of implying that if wireless net neutrality is reversed, then Silicon Valley edge providers may have more interest in controlling a distribution network in wireless? And second, on your comments on Sling, most of these media companies all tell us that they're sort of arbitraging indifferently by selling content to these new platforms and the economics are the same, if not better. But you've had the product for the longest time and you haven't seen any rate increase. I'm assuming your underlying programming costs are increasing. And sort of can you just talk more about the profitability and the sustainability of the OTT model? Thanks. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Yeah. Let me take the second part first. It's true that potentially OTT economics and what we traditionally see in linear could be relatively the same for an incremental customer, right, in part because your SAC is so much lower for your OTT product and you have the potential for an advertising model to be dramatically better, right? So that has to be all proven out, but the theory there I think still holds. Having said that, you don't know what  when people have alternative motives, if you're selling video but you're also selling shipping services, you may subsidize one over the other. If you're selling wireless data plans and that's very profitable, you may subsidize something else. So I think there's going to be some dynamics in the industry where the models move all over the place. We'll just have to wait and see. But again, for us, we control what we control as we have to make a technically great product, a good user interface and make sure that within our programming contracts and the way that they're offered to the consumer is both unique and economical. And so that's kind of how we focus. And then on your question about Silicon Valley, I do think that it's not really  let me answer broader. I do think that now that the quiet period's over and for the foreseeable future most of the spectrum is auctioned off in the United States with minor exception, that there  and with technology and the paradigm shift to 5G, that I think we'll see a couple of things. One is, I think, obviously, you could see consolidation within the wireless industry today with incumbents consolidating in some form or fashion. But I do believe that the cable industry has to take a good hard look at how they participate in this industry and potentially much more so than an MVNO deal. And I do think that one or more people from Silicon Valley will look at it more seriously, not just because of perhaps net neutrality regulations being weakened, but because their business depends on connectivity. Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg did his 10-year plan. His first slide on his 10-year plan, it only has one word for 10 years and it's called connectivity. And so whether it be balloons or drones or connectivity or autonomous vehicles or healthcare, Silicon Valley is all over connectivity. And they're going to have to make sure that in a world of net neutrality, maybe Title II being eliminated; at least I would think they have to make sure that they're positioned so that they're not in a situation where their traffic, their connectivity is clogged. And then there's a third entrant that may come, which is less likely but still possible, is on the international side. I think that somebody ultimately is going to put together worldwide connectivity and worldwide  both on the satellite and a terrestrial basis. Obviously, the things like OneWeb on a satellite basis with low-earth satellites that could do worldwide connectivity and then you're going to do the same thing on the ground. So you're going to end up with possibilities there. So there's going to be a lot of movement. There's probably going to be a couple of phases of movement within the connectivity industry. And I'm pleased that we were able to participate in the 600-megahertz auction and strengthen our position in terms of where we can go and what we can do with connectivity. By the way, just as a thought, there was nobody in the last two auctions that has risked more capital in the connectivity business than DISH along with our DEs. And in the auction that was  the third auction, the H Block auction, we're the only major participant in that. So we've been the most aggressive in that. History will prove it's a good strategy or bad strategy. But for the investors on the call, all your investments that you're making today, whether it be  that you're looking at in the future, whether it be autonomous vehicles or augmented reality or virtual reality or artificial intelligence or how do we get healthcare costs under control or how do you get productivity in industrial manufacturing or agriculture or what do municipalities do to make their cities safer and more productive, how you do education, how you do entertainment; not one of those potential investors can survive without connectivity in the future. Not one of them. So one of the things that's interesting about where DISH is today is you can actually get a piece of all those investments by investing in one company because all those companies are going to have to use connectivity in their portfolio. They have to, right? That doesn't mean that there's not more money in the value-add on top of connectivity. Doesn't mean that sharing stuff with your friends about what you're watching or what you're cooking or whatever isn't more valuable because it might be. But you still have to be connected. Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI Okay. Thanks so much. Operator And we'll take our next question from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks. Two for Charlie and then one for Steve. Charlie, you talk about a network build. And I guess the question is are you planning to partner? Because the Wall Street perception is sort of that you have to and that it's unlikely to be Verizon or AT&T, that it could be someone like an Amazon or anyone else outside of the ecosystem. Second question would be, whether you would part with the DBS business separately from spectrum or should we think about those sort of married into one event if that was ever to happen? And then the question for Steve. Can you talk about trends in SAC longer term? So this was down 24% year-over-year. And if subscriber trends were to remain like this going forward, would the decline continue on this trend? Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Okay, Marci. On the network build, our focus today is to build out our network to meet our 2020 deadline with or without partners. So we're prepared to do it within our balance sheet. And with  again, it's going be a new narrowband IoT network that doesn't exist today. So it's going to attack the market from a little bit different way, but it's certainly very much needed in terms of the United States. Obviously, I believe that there would be opportunity  I hope that there's opportunity the next three years where other people  for a lot of different potential partnerships. For example, other people and that could be  it could be Verizon or AT&T or one of the other incumbents are where they're actually going to the tower to build out some of their spectrum. So for example, T-Mobile's going to go build 600 megahertz spectrum, maybe starting as early as later this year. There's opportunity there to say let's build that together. Let's build that at the same time and share the savings. AT&T and Verizon are going build their AWS-3 spectrum at some point. There's a chance to partner with those build-outs, even though you might be separate companies, in some cases you might be competitors. It still might make sense because both of you save money, so there's an opportunity. There's tower companies that have to look long-term for new revenue sources that might want to partner in a certain sort of way. And then as you mentioned, there's people outside the industry who might want to protect their connectivity who might like these things. So I think there's any number of combinations there. But for the  right now, we're going to control what we can control and that's to go out and build a narrowband IoT network by 2020. And I can only go back to when we were build satellites. I tried to get everybody in the world to build us a satellite. We were launching DBS and nobody would do it, so we got in the satellite business and built them ourself. And I think we're launching our 23 satellite this summer or something. So thank god nobody wanted to  I mean thank god nobody wanted to build them for us because it would've cost us a lot more money. But part of management is to figure out how you're going to do things and to be creative on how you're going to do things and to prove the skeptics wrong. Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Does the 600 megahertz change the cost of the build-out? Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. It does. It could  I guess it could. For example, I'm just a simple example, but we have some AWS-4 spectrum, its down-link only, in the 2.2 gig range. The limiting factor of your network is typically your uplink side. So now that we have 600 megahertz uplink nationwide, you could see with carrier aggregation that you could partner  you could put 600 megahertz with AWS-4 and your build-out costs could be materially less because you need less towers because you've solved some of your uplink propagation issues with 600 megahertz. So I could make the case that the  that there's potential that much of the $6.2 billion of 600 megahertz spectrum actually could result in savings both on the build-out and the future operating cost on a net present value that could equate to a number pretty close to that. So I'm not confident enough to say that for sure today, but my sense is that there is probably a large savings in the build-out costs based on the 600 megahertz purchase. The other question about separate DBS from  I've always felt that what we do at Sling and DBS and spectrum all go together. I think that our  I think with the 600 megahertz auction and the way that that really solidified the spectrum position we have that it is  it would be easier to separate some of our assets than it was before. But I still think they belong together. I mean obviously, one could now make the case that the  both the AT&T DBS and the DISH DBS could go together and there would obviously be tremendous synergy and savings in doing that. And that because of all the OT  that because the competition  it wouldn't be going from 4 to 3, it would be going from 4 to 10 because of Sony and YouTube  Google and Hulu. Those are all real competitors to the DBS players today. So it's not a  it probably is not a regulatory issue today to put those companies together. And clearly, those companies together would be more value for both those companies than probably the market gives them credit for today. What was the other question? Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp. So, Marci, on SAC. On a per subscriber basis, the SAC has been relatively stable if you will, per addition on the underlying DBS ads as well as the Sling ads. It really depends on the mix associated with Sling relative to DBS. Just taking a step back and looking at the strategy. For DBS, we have been saying for several quarters now we are acquiring and retaining higher quality customers by refocusing on worldwide of these. We're more disciplined on credit and we're executing on several costs and revenue initiatives. And as we've already mentioned on the Sling side, we expect to see ARPU and margin expansion as it gains scale. For instance, we haven't fully monetized our Sling addressable advertising revenue opportunity yet. And then lastly, I already mentioned this in my preamble but for dishNET, given the wholesale economics, we believe it's the right time for us economically, which impacts SAC, and for our Pay-TV customers to pivot away from the wholesale model. So you'll see less absolute dollars running through the P&L associated with the dishNET ads, as we pivot away from the wholesale model. Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you very much. Operator And we'll take our next question from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead. Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. I had a question for Mr. Ergen. You talked about building a narrowband IoT network and also talked about looking at spectrum on the dollar per megahertz per thing basis as opposed to pop. I guess my question is this, do you really think in the next five years, there will be a business that is an IOT business, because maybe I'm too myopic, not forward thinking enough, but I sort of struggle with imagining a set of customers that could help your top line in the IoT space within five years. So if you could just elaborate on that a bit? Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Well, I guess I'd answer the question. IOT will be a huge business. And I wouldn't put the timeframe at five years. I think it will be evident to everyone within five years that it will be a huge business. Whether that will be just like the Internet was in the 1980s and people didn't realize that the Facebook and the Google were going to exist because of the  I think you're kind of in the same  I think it will go faster, but you're in the same situation where the possibility of Internet of Things is not going be  is going be underestimated long-term in terms of it just like the Internet was underestimated and the cloud has been underestimated. And now people are  the Fortune 500 companies of the future have been built from those businesses. So I think my  I believe Internet of Things will be huge. Whether we're sitting here five years from now, saying, it's X or Year, probably won't be that relevant because it's ultimately going be a thousand X at some point. It's just hard to put a timeframe on it. But you do need 5G so you're talking about 2021, probably 2022, to make it really work the way you want it to work. So I think  you already kind of have Internet of Things. I mean in a funny sort of way Facebook is Internet of Things, it just connects people to their social life, right? But when you can connect the city and your meters and your security and your lights and everything else, the city can be more efficient and the city can save money and so they're going to do it. And anything that's cheaper and better, you're going do, and the Internet of Things for sure is going to be cheaper and better. And I can think of a thousand things that need to get connected and there's probably another million things that we can't think of that other people will think of to be connected. And part of what we're looking at is our system to be open so that anybody who wants to participate in the network can invent things for the network. Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Thank you. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Operator, I think we have time for one more before we go to the press. Operator Sounds great. Thank you. We'll take our final question from the analyst community. Our final analyst question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC Thanks. Charlie, this is a question I think everybody has been trying to ask in lots of oblique ways, so let me just ask it a little more directly. How has your thinking evolved as to whether you would prefer to sell your spectrum, lease your spectrum, or lease the network, or just run it yourself? I guess as an outside observer, it would seem buying 600 megahertz spectrum is a lot more consistent with someone who actually wants to run a network than with someone who is looking to sell spectrum. Is that a reasonable interpretation of your participation in the auction? Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Well, I mean, I think one of the things you do when you start a business, you'd like that business to last more than 37 years, which is you'd like your business to last 100 years. So obviously we think pivoting to connectivity allows us to have a much longer runway for our company. But I think the way I would answer the question is, we're looking for whatever ultimately would enhance our shareholder value and our customers' and our employees' experience. And we think  at least today  we think that that is somebody who is looking at the wireless world in a disruptive manner that says the wireless connectivity in the United States is going to be different than four guys who you can make phone calls on and you can send a text and maybe you can stream a little bit of video, right, and you have an unlimited plan that's 22 gigs but they call it unlimited, so you have a limited unlimited plan. We think the world of wireless can be materially different than that. It can be different because there's a paradigm shift in technology, the way you build your radio, the way you're going to propagate your network, whether it be inside out, maybe inside out instead of outside in, whether your core and how you do your network, the ability to slice your network in different slices, the ability to let other people share your network. All those things are possible in the 5G world. And for somebody who shares that vision of where things can go, we could get pretty excited about. If somebody says we're going to just do the same thing we're doing today, we're not that interested in that because we don't think that builds long-term shareholder value for our shareholders. So we try to look at where things are going instead of where they are. Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC Thank you, Charlie. Operator We will now take questions from the members of the media. Our first media question comes from Scott Moritz with Bloomberg. Please go ahead. Scott Moritz - Bloomberg News Hey, thanks. Charlie, I guess I know it's only been four days, but have you folks received any kind of inquiries yet on deals? And are you surprised at all by the activity or lack of activity in that period? And also a second question. A lot of speculation around Sprint, T-Mobile, obviously. If that deal happens, would you feel like you needed to object to it, try to block it? Or would you feel there are still many other options available to you? Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Yeah. Scott, you've known us for a while. We don't  we won't  we're pretty private. I'm certainly a pretty private individual. So we're not going to comment in any way on discussions that take place, don't take place, rumors that are true, rumors that are not true, rumors that are outlandish, or whatever. We're just not going to comment on that. And our conversations that we have with people, we keep private. So you're not going read about them in the paper or a book. So that's just the way we do business and we're continuing to do that. Obviously, there could be consolidation within the industry. Certainly, Sprint and T-Mobile would be a possible combination of companies. And if there were to be a combination of companies, we'd take a look at it to see whether we thought that that combination was detrimental to the consumer or detrimental to competition or not. And we wouldn't be opposed to consolidation just because it's consolidation. We'd only be opposed to it if we thought it had an impact on competition. So, we haven't objected to some consolidations in the past out there. And others, we have. And I think we're kind of like the justice department. We look at each  and the FCC. We look at each case individually and try to make a judgment as to how that's going to affect competition. Operator We'll take our next question from Ben Markus with Colorado Public Radio. Please go ahead. Ben Markus - Colorado Public Radio Hi, guys. Just generally looking back at the last few quarters, how is it that subscriber base and revenue is eroding yet profits are going up? Are you just becoming more efficient as a company? Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Ben, it's a good  I think it's because we've really turned our investment to the future investment  the majority of our future investment to connectivity and obviously in spectrum purchases so that we can be a viable company in the 21st century. So the return on investment in a mature industry normally declines. So the return on investment from a customer that we would go out and spend $800 SAC from 10 years ago is a different profile than if we go spend $800 a SAC for a customer today given the rising cost of programming and the decline in viewership of traditional linear channels. So I think we're just trying to allocate our capital more precisely. And what that has led to is pretty flat revenue. I mean, most economic metrics over the last couple years have been pretty flat for us, but we're building for the future and so you, while you're investing in the future, you're not going to get those revenues from the future. So we're just building on our first networks. It's going to take us three years to build our network, so we're not going get a ton of revenue from our investment for three more years, right? And then we think that that jump starts a whole another growth phase for DISH. Operator We'll take our next question with Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US) Thanks. Question for Mr. Ergen. I'd just like to follow-up on your answer to Craig's question. Were you saying that effectively, if Verizon or AT&T wanted to buy your spectrum to support their existing business that you wouldn't sell it to them no matter what the price is? They have to share your vision of the future if you'd be willing to sell it? Or lease it to them? Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Jonathan, when did you get in the press? Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US) I... Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. You're such a great investment banker and analyst, you know, and now you're in the press? I didn't know that. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US) I'll do anything to speak to you, Mr. Ergen. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Well, I appreciate that. I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is that, obviously, this is a board decision. If somebody came in and said, here's cash offer and you looked at tax consequences that offer was more than you thought you could do with your business yourself, that's something that our board would consider. To extent that you took equity for something like that you'd want to make sure your equity was going go up in value more than staying your current course. And so those are all the kind of considerations that you'd want to have out there. But the  most management in public companies has a hard time taking a long view, right and making long-term investments, because they get pounded by everybody if their sales go down or their earnings per share missed by a penny or whatever. So they have a hard time, which is why you see crazy offers where you can get  I mean, you could get Apple TV box that costs $150 but you could get it for $105 if you sign up for three months of programming that probably costs $150. So in that particular case that company probably lost $300 on every customer they got. Well, why would you do that? You might do that for strategic reasons but we also want to make sure your numbers don't go down for Wall Street. Well, I'd prefer to save the $300 and then put it into something else that's going make money long-term. So we really think the wireless industry is right for a new way of doing things and a new way that you would build a network and new architecture, take advantage of 5G and the Internet of Things and I don't doubt that there are people within the incumbents today that share that vision, right? Whether they can get through their boards and take long-term measures, it might be a different story. But to extent, they could I think they'd be attractive people to talk to. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US) Great. Thanks very much. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.

And we'll take our first question from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi, guys. Thanks. Two, if I can. Charlie, can you talk about your spectrum strategy going into the auction and how you ended up? How does having the 600 megahertz spectrum change the value of the overall portfolio? And then second for Steve. Can you quantify for us the litigation impact from the first quarter that impacted G&A? Thank you. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Okay. Phil, it's Charlie. I'll take the first part. You never know what an auction is going to do. So  but our strategy going in, first, we thought it would go for materially higher than it did. But our strategy was to get one nationwide block of low-band spectrum because it does so many other things for our spectrum portfolio. Obviously, 600 low-band propagates farther. So in terms of penetration through walls and basements and things for your signal, that was an important part of where we were trying to go. Second, when you start looking at the Internet of Things and all the devices you're going be connecting in the future, low-band is ideal for Internet of Things and that technology is going to change quite a bit with 5G and so there's a focus there. We were pleasantly surprised that as the auction went on, it became clear at the end of the  the first round or the second round that the price was not going up; that it was going stay sub-$20 billion based on our projections. And we felt that was probably in excess of $0.50 on the dollar in terms of real value for the spectrum. So we were then able to not only get our nationwide spectrum but also then to stay in the bigger cities where we felt that the  particularly the Internet of Things would be beneficial. So one of the things about auctions today is that the way the FCC does it it's based on population. So everything  every analyst and everything, I always quote megahertz per pop. But the last several auctions, we've kind of looked at where we think things are going and we look at it on megahertz per thing, not megahertz per pop or megahertz per microprocessor. So whether it'd be streetlights or heart monitors or automobiles or drones or whatever, we've always looked at it as a megahertz per thing. And when you do that, obviously the more densely populated cities are quite a bit of a bargain discount, if you believe our theory is right on that. So that was the strategy. We were pleasantly surprised. Pleased to be one of two companies that got nationwide blocks in the auction. So, Steve? Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp. Yes. Phil, so unfortunately, I can't quantify the litigation impact because these settlements were confidential. I can say that even without the litigation impacts, we would have been down year-over-year on the G&A line. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thanks, Steve. Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp. Sure. Operator And we'll take our next question from Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Please go ahead. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC Thanks. Charlie, when the FCC made the decision on the designated entity bidding credits, I think you had mentioned something like they obviously don't want us to be a competitor and maybe look to sell it and I think at the time, you might have even talked about, Jason breaking up or looking at ways to have those assets in different buckets. Now that you've come away with this 600 megahertz band, I mean, it's a more complete package, has your view on that changed? And should we rule out the possibility of you selling any of this stuff in pieces and this is more kind of a do something with it in its entirety or  and only if someone's willing to pay for it in its entirety, would you actually willing to sell it? Thanks. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. I guess on the AWS-3 auction where we obviously participated with two designated entities, I think at least we were  at least myself personally, beyond depressed when the FCC ruled that they would disallow the discounts, because I knew that we had followed the rules and the precedent that  and every other company had taken  all of our competitors taken advantage of the discounts in such a massive auction. But obviously, the number was quite big but, on a relative basis, it really wasn't just anything historical, and it's no different. And then at the same time, you have an auction of airways for broadcasters where the government gave them spectrum for free and they just walked away with $10 billion and not a word is said about the fact that broadcasters walked away with $10 billion of profits for something they got for free and we were buying spectrum. So, to me, I don't believe it was fair. And probably more disconcerting, we were never allowed to come into the FCC and to the extent they had issues with it to work through those issues with the FCC so that the outcome was fair. So obviously that's in litigation today. That's in front of the courts. The courts will decide whether the FCC followed within jurisdiction or whether they didn't. And we'll live  who knows how long that will go on. But look we're going live with  you can always have honest disagreements. We have an honest disagreement with the past administration on that one. And we'll see what the courts come through. Having said that, we aren't giving up and we didn't give up and we're not giving up. And so we're really pleased to strengthen our spectrum position and our strategic position and we're not going to rule anything out and we're not going to rule anything in. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC Okay. So even though it's a more complete package now, you don't rule out  in certain situations, if someone wanted to buy a piece of the package that you would consider that as well? Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Well, I mean, I think that there are  look, I think there's interesting parts in this auction. I think it's  I don't want to speak for AT&T, but it's pretty clear that they didn't bid  I don't believe they placed a bid of any consequence after the first round. And obviously with their  excuse me, first stage. And obviously, with their selection in the FirstNet sweepstakes, that may be a lower priority to them. So there's people perhaps that are in this auction that have other strategic interest and there's certainly things that could happen where you can see, just like in football, somebody's got a good tight end and somebody needs a defensive back and you can see things happening with any number of companies. But you got to have a portfolio to play there. Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC Okay. Understood. And I think Rich wants to try and pin you down on a Sling number. Standby. Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC So and, Charlie, last month comScore reported that Sling subs, if you include both domestic and international subscribers to at least one of your Sling packages, was something like 700,000 in July of 2016 and moved all the way up to 1.9 million by the end of 2016. Curious if that type of dramatic acceleration in Sling actually happened in the latter half of 2016 and what drove it. And just from a higher level, I guess, is it now conceivable that Sling, in some form, domestic, international, that that represents upwards of 15% of overall DISH video subscribers. Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp. Hey, Rich. It's Roger. I'm going to field this one. Just on your second one, we don't break out Sling numbers separately, so can't answer that. Certainly, the second half of the year is a strong content time of year for us given all of the college and NFL football that occurs. So seasonally, we traditionally see stronger growth during the last four months of the year than we do in other periods of similar length throughout the year. So we can't comment on specific numbers but that is a seasonally strong period for us. Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC And the other services that have launched haven't notably changed the trajectory of Sling, meaning competitors? Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp. The other services that have launched have all really been big bundle OTT services, so largely replicating traditional Pay-TV packages. And so when I look at our portfolio with Sling Orange, which is at $20, the closest competitor really is about 75% higher price point, plus we have this ability to pick and choose the genres you want to add on, or our Sling Blue service, which, at $25, is quite attractive, has a lot of content in it. And obviously it doesn't have ESPN in it. We know a lot of people like ESPN but there are people who don't want to pay for ESPN. And so that gives us a cost advantage for that package compared to some of the other big bundles  for that service, sorry, compared to those other big bundles. Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC Thanks very much. Operator And we'll take our next question from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC Great. Thanks. Charlie, could you talk about your view on the sort of timing of the 5G rollout in the United States and sort of your view on how the technology is progressing? And then secondly, the big carriers seem to be focusing on the millimeter wave portion of the spectrum, whereas you're focused more on the sort of low and mid band. One, do you think their focus on the very high frequencies is misplaced? And where do you think the bulk of the heavy lifting on 5G will take place? Thanks. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Yeah. So I mean, there's  and there's a lot of misconception about 5G but I think I want to now  if you've ever watched Spinal Tap, I want to announce here first and foremost that we're going turn the volume up to 11 and we're going for  we're going to build out 11G and we're just going to go from 5G to 11G. And obviously, I'm being facetious that the 5G standard is not set yet so there's  you're not going to see true 5G until 2020 and probably 2021 in terms of 5G. And the main things that  5G is going to  it does a couple things, but one is much lower latency, which brings in things like autonomous vehicles, health care and things into a network that maybe won't work ideally on existing networks. It certainly brings in Internet of Things in a way that with millions of devices it can connect at one time that you really can't do on existing infrastructure today. And of course, obviously it's more  it's going to bring 10, 20, 100 times more capacity in certain areas and adds things like millimeter wave technology. So it is a very transitional, it is a very big paradigm shift. And I think from a marketing people  marketing thing, people are going to want  jump the gun and call things 5G, but I don't think, you're  as an American consumer you're going to get anything truly 5G standard, just the total standard, until at least 2020. As far as millimeter wave technology, I think it's very interesting technology. We have believed that for long time. We participated in the auction, the 28-gig auction. Gosh, it's been like 15 years ago, so we own four cities of 28-gig technology. But we also participated in MVDDS auction with 12-gig frequencies and that we have in most of the major cities in the United States and we're part of the MVDDS coalition that we believe that is the way for the government to add another 500 megahertz of spectrum that can be used for terrestrial use. We use that for satellite today. And we've worked with both the past and the current administrations to explain how that can help fund some of the spectrum gap out there. So we're hopeful that  we just missed getting on the rulemaking for spectrum frontiers last time. We'll hope that the current administration will put that spectrum on public notice or in the rulemaking, so that people can comment. But that's certainly a place for the government to add another 500 megahertz of spectrum. And again, it's technically centimeter wave technology. It has better propagation technique  characteristics than 28-gig does and you can imagine a lot of uses in the spectrum deficit, how you could use that. So I think we're very well positioned, if higher frequencies find a home, we think we're well positioned there. John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Thanks. Operator And we'll take our next question from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Thanks. Two questions. So first, Charlie, just following up on the timing question. Can you talk about how some of the build-out requirements impact your decision on moving ahead with the spectrum build-out? And whether or not you feel that with a potential consolidation on the carrier side, namely T-Mobile and Sprint, if you feel like that leads you to any urgency to make a decision one way or the other? And then, Steve, can you talk about the ARPU impact from Sling TV and how we should think about the mix impact on total ARPU? Thank you. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Okay, Amy, on the build-out, one of the things I learned long ago is we focus on the things we can control. So while there's going be a lot of noise and there's certainly going to be talk of consolidation and lots of rumors about this company and that company doing something together, the one thing we can control is our build-out. And we have committed to the FCC that we will build out a narrow-band to IoT network to perfect our license by March of 2020. Because of our spectrum position with the different bands we have, now with 600 megahertz in the mix as well, there are several different ways we could build that network out. Ideally, we'd like to build out 600 in the IoT network. But because of the 39-month clearing schedule, it's possible that to meet that deadline in March of 2020 that we can't necessarily use 600 in the way that we'd like to do it because that's a great frequency for that. So Tom and his team are now meeting with the vendors and we're also talking to the industry about what they want to see in an IoT network. And then we'll make some decisions later this year as to the frequencies that we're going to build out and then start the planning process and then start to build probably  we got to get  we have to get equipment and then start to build late next year and complete it by March of 2020. So that's the one thing we can control. We feel like our balance sheet can support that build. We believe that that's what we control. In the meantime, I think obviously there's  in terms of the industry, I think there certainly will be a lot of discussions between people in the industry, potentially people outside the industry. Certainly, the potential of lighter regulatory in this administration could lead to some consolidation in ways that maybe weren't contemplated in the previous administration. And we have a tremendous set of assets at DISH. And it's our job as management to put those assets to work in the most economic long-term model that makes sense for our shareholders and for our customers. And that's what we'll do. Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp. Yes, Amy. For ARPU, you're right. Sling TV subscribers on average purchase the lower-price programming compared to DBS. So therefore, as Sling TV subscribers increase, the weighted average Pay-TV ARPU will be lower. For DBS, we are seeing some subscribers shift to smaller, less expense packaging, commonly, as you know, known as cord shaving. Seeing that these customers want less robust packages, we did add Flex Pack, which is a skinny bundle option. And while the Flex Pack adds pressure to ARPU growth on the DBS side, we believe the function of Flex Pack as a churn-reducing save tactic increases margins in the instances where we had previously offered customers loyalty credits. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Got it. Thank you. Operator And we'll take our next question from Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead. Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group Great, thank you. Two questions. First, on the changing competitive dynamic in video, what we saw in the quarter or last quarter was DIRECTV didn't add subs for the first time in about six quarters due perhaps to higher churn because their subscribers are going to cable bundled with broadband and I guess over the top. So are you guys seeing anything incremental in terms of the competitive dynamic? And are you seeing Sling getting more subs from DIRECTV satellite? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Yeah. This is Charlie. I think your thesis is generally correct and I think we've been talking about that for at least five years, that that's kind of what we foresaw that the bundle  there's a lot of dynamics, but the bundle where programmers had a lot of leverage over the distribution path and you're forced to take not one or two channels or the top three rated channels from an event. But you may take 11, 12, 15 channels of which 10 of them maybe you don't really want, but you got to pass those costs onto consumers. And the second dynamic is retransmission consent has gone up thousands of percent to the point where the cost of your local networks now exceed, for the most part, almost every channel but ESPN. And that dynamic is such that  and in all these cases, the ratings of the particular networks, for the most part, have gone down. And in the broadcasters' case, they've gone down significantly. So that's a dynamic that pushes people away from Pay-TV all together. And for those who stay in Pay-TV, they're going to go down to lower-cost alternatives. Less advertising, more binge viewing and the kind of things that have led to the rise of things like Netflix. So that's the dynamic that's out there. So one of the things that we've done is in recognizing those trends; obviously, we have pivoted the company to a connectivity company and have tried to invest in those things that we think have long-term returns and invest less in our traditional business. So we're less likely to invest in a DBS subscriber in Boston, Massachusetts, where they've got good Internet connection from multiple sources who have an advantage in bundling both broadband and potentially OTT video. Roger then set on task  it's been almost six years now that Roger was set the course to come up with product that would be meaningful to consumers in that environment. So we think that we're well-positioned there. We think we're disciplined. We think that despite the fact that analysts and headlines are about sub loss or sub gain or this ARPU or that ARPU or this quarter or that quarter, we think we're very well-disciplined to take the  one of the few companies that can take a long-term view of it and say we're not afraid to change. We see the change happening and how do we take advantage of the change in a way that perhaps our competitors aren't doing or are slow to react or want to hold onto what they have but aren't really going to where the future is. And so it's difficult. There's course studies in MBA schools. There's a book written about it in terms of the entrepreneur's dilemma or whatever it's called, and we're living that every day. I forget the other part of the question. Was it - Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp. ...competitor impact. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Yeah, Roger, can you address it? Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp. Yeah, it's Roger. I'd say, well, one thing I've noticed is with the launch of these other OTT services, starting with DIRECTV NOW, they are bigger bundle packages. And so we're seeing Sling customers increasingly taking more add-on packs. So it may be a different class of customers coming into the market spurred by the big bundles that have launched in OTT. But we're definitely seeing customers who are taking more add-on packs that is certainly correlated with that. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Yeah, and this is Charlie. I think strategically when we started Sling, we were not looking to replace the cable bundle. We were not looking to take a cable subscriber or for that matter a satellite subscriber and suddenly convert them into an OTT because that was adding SAC to get the same customer. So that has not been our primary objective. Having said that, it appears that where Hulu and YouTube and DIRECTV NOW and Sony are, that they all are basically replicating the cable bundle. And so there's no question now that it's game on to convert a cable subscriber to an OTT subscriber for essentially the same services. So all those guys have, example, the Disney products with ESPN, which is, as you know, one of the most costly. And yet, studies show and we know from our own internal data that the vast majority of people do not actually watch ESPN particularly year-round. So you're ending up at  so that maybe there's a different strategy in there that works long term. If everybody's going north, maybe you should go northwest in life. Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group Well, looking - Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Maybe not. Maybe you should go north, but maybe you should go northwest. So my point is that I think the OTT model probably initially is going be a license to lose money for people as they price things below cost. Eventually, it'll sort its way out. And there'll probably be several different strategies within the OTT world. And Roger and his team are well-acquainted with potential avenues they could take. Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group Well, in that vein, Charlie, OTT services to me seem like they're frenemies, right? So they compete with each other but they also  if they get together, they can change the market and they can grow it, right? Do you see a tipping point that's going to be particularly notable as they cannibalize  they go from cannibalizing each other to taking more share away from Pay-TV? Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Well, my belief is that OTT will take share away from Pay-TV. So satellite and cable will be smaller five years from now than they are today. And so satellite, you're already seeing that reduction, right, and satellite and phone companies, you've seen reductions really for the last couple of years. Cable, I think, with the strength of broadband has been able to kind of tread water and I think actually potentially gain some subs. And I think ultimately that will reverse too and that you will see a natural evolution to an OTT product because OTT in many ways can be a superior product. It can be less expensive and it can be superior. The question's going be what do those OTT bundles look like and how chopped up does the consumer get because he's going to have a lot more choice. And when he has more choice, he's going to go different directions. And meanwhile, obviously, Amazon and Netflix continue to grow. So it's a very interesting dynamic. The one thing I know  the reason I sleep at night pretty well is that all those people have one thing in common. They need to be connected. They need connectivity for those customers to receive video. And we know, Roger knows that the vast majority of sessions for people who are taking OTT services are actually not on your TV screen but on mobile devices. So that means that you need wireless spectrum to connect, right? And so that's one point. Second point I'd make is you're in a regulatory environment where the current administration has said they're not in favor of  I don't want to put words in their mouth. But I think, correct me if I'm wrong, they're not really in favor of Title II. They're going to do a rule-making on net neutrality and that there's probably a lighter regulatory touch with that, which I would think to mean that the balance of power between distribution and content owners gets a little bit more level. Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group Super. Thank you. Operator And we'll take our next question from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI Thanks. Charlie, based on your last comment, so are you sort of implying that if wireless net neutrality is reversed, then Silicon Valley edge providers may have more interest in controlling a distribution network in wireless? And second, on your comments on Sling, most of these media companies all tell us that they're sort of arbitraging indifferently by selling content to these new platforms and the economics are the same, if not better. But you've had the product for the longest time and you haven't seen any rate increase. I'm assuming your underlying programming costs are increasing. And sort of can you just talk more about the profitability and the sustainability of the OTT model? Thanks. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Yeah. Let me take the second part first. It's true that potentially OTT economics and what we traditionally see in linear could be relatively the same for an incremental customer, right, in part because your SAC is so much lower for your OTT product and you have the potential for an advertising model to be dramatically better, right? So that has to be all proven out, but the theory there I think still holds. Having said that, you don't know what  when people have alternative motives, if you're selling video but you're also selling shipping services, you may subsidize one over the other. If you're selling wireless data plans and that's very profitable, you may subsidize something else. So I think there's going to be some dynamics in the industry where the models move all over the place. We'll just have to wait and see. But again, for us, we control what we control as we have to make a technically great product, a good user interface and make sure that within our programming contracts and the way that they're offered to the consumer is both unique and economical. And so that's kind of how we focus. And then on your question about Silicon Valley, I do think that it's not really  let me answer broader. I do think that now that the quiet period's over and for the foreseeable future most of the spectrum is auctioned off in the United States with minor exception, that there  and with technology and the paradigm shift to 5G, that I think we'll see a couple of things. One is, I think, obviously, you could see consolidation within the wireless industry today with incumbents consolidating in some form or fashion. But I do believe that the cable industry has to take a good hard look at how they participate in this industry and potentially much more so than an MVNO deal. And I do think that one or more people from Silicon Valley will look at it more seriously, not just because of perhaps net neutrality regulations being weakened, but because their business depends on connectivity. Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg did his 10-year plan. His first slide on his 10-year plan, it only has one word for 10 years and it's called connectivity. And so whether it be balloons or drones or connectivity or autonomous vehicles or healthcare, Silicon Valley is all over connectivity. And they're going to have to make sure that in a world of net neutrality, maybe Title II being eliminated; at least I would think they have to make sure that they're positioned so that they're not in a situation where their traffic, their connectivity is clogged. And then there's a third entrant that may come, which is less likely but still possible, is on the international side. I think that somebody ultimately is going to put together worldwide connectivity and worldwide  both on the satellite and a terrestrial basis. Obviously, the things like OneWeb on a satellite basis with low-earth satellites that could do worldwide connectivity and then you're going to do the same thing on the ground. So you're going to end up with possibilities there. So there's going to be a lot of movement. There's probably going to be a couple of phases of movement within the connectivity industry. And I'm pleased that we were able to participate in the 600-megahertz auction and strengthen our position in terms of where we can go and what we can do with connectivity. By the way, just as a thought, there was nobody in the last two auctions that has risked more capital in the connectivity business than DISH along with our DEs. And in the auction that was  the third auction, the H Block auction, we're the only major participant in that. So we've been the most aggressive in that. History will prove it's a good strategy or bad strategy. But for the investors on the call, all your investments that you're making today, whether it be  that you're looking at in the future, whether it be autonomous vehicles or augmented reality or virtual reality or artificial intelligence or how do we get healthcare costs under control or how do you get productivity in industrial manufacturing or agriculture or what do municipalities do to make their cities safer and more productive, how you do education, how you do entertainment; not one of those potential investors can survive without connectivity in the future. Not one of them. So one of the things that's interesting about where DISH is today is you can actually get a piece of all those investments by investing in one company because all those companies are going to have to use connectivity in their portfolio. They have to, right? That doesn't mean that there's not more money in the value-add on top of connectivity. Doesn't mean that sharing stuff with your friends about what you're watching or what you're cooking or whatever isn't more valuable because it might be. But you still have to be connected. Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI Okay. Thanks so much. Operator And we'll take our next question from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks. Two for Charlie and then one for Steve. Charlie, you talk about a network build. And I guess the question is are you planning to partner? Because the Wall Street perception is sort of that you have to and that it's unlikely to be Verizon or AT&T, that it could be someone like an Amazon or anyone else outside of the ecosystem. Second question would be, whether you would part with the DBS business separately from spectrum or should we think about those sort of married into one event if that was ever to happen? And then the question for Steve. Can you talk about trends in SAC longer term? So this was down 24% year-over-year. And if subscriber trends were to remain like this going forward, would the decline continue on this trend? Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Okay, Marci. On the network build, our focus today is to build out our network to meet our 2020 deadline with or without partners. So we're prepared to do it within our balance sheet. And with  again, it's going be a new narrowband IoT network that doesn't exist today. So it's going to attack the market from a little bit different way, but it's certainly very much needed in terms of the United States. Obviously, I believe that there would be opportunity  I hope that there's opportunity the next three years where other people  for a lot of different potential partnerships. For example, other people and that could be  it could be Verizon or AT&T or one of the other incumbents are where they're actually going to the tower to build out some of their spectrum. So for example, T-Mobile's going to go build 600 megahertz spectrum, maybe starting as early as later this year. There's opportunity there to say let's build that together. Let's build that at the same time and share the savings. AT&T and Verizon are going build their AWS-3 spectrum at some point. There's a chance to partner with those build-outs, even though you might be separate companies, in some cases you might be competitors. It still might make sense because both of you save money, so there's an opportunity. There's tower companies that have to look long-term for new revenue sources that might want to partner in a certain sort of way. And then as you mentioned, there's people outside the industry who might want to protect their connectivity who might like these things. So I think there's any number of combinations there. But for the  right now, we're going to control what we can control and that's to go out and build a narrowband IoT network by 2020. And I can only go back to when we were build satellites. I tried to get everybody in the world to build us a satellite. We were launching DBS and nobody would do it, so we got in the satellite business and built them ourself. And I think we're launching our 23 satellite this summer or something. So thank god nobody wanted to  I mean thank god nobody wanted to build them for us because it would've cost us a lot more money. But part of management is to figure out how you're going to do things and to be creative on how you're going to do things and to prove the skeptics wrong. Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Does the 600 megahertz change the cost of the build-out? Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. It does. It could  I guess it could. For example, I'm just a simple example, but we have some AWS-4 spectrum, its down-link only, in the 2.2 gig range. The limiting factor of your network is typically your uplink side. So now that we have 600 megahertz uplink nationwide, you could see with carrier aggregation that you could partner  you could put 600 megahertz with AWS-4 and your build-out costs could be materially less because you need less towers because you've solved some of your uplink propagation issues with 600 megahertz. So I could make the case that the  that there's potential that much of the $6.2 billion of 600 megahertz spectrum actually could result in savings both on the build-out and the future operating cost on a net present value that could equate to a number pretty close to that. So I'm not confident enough to say that for sure today, but my sense is that there is probably a large savings in the build-out costs based on the 600 megahertz purchase. The other question about separate DBS from  I've always felt that what we do at Sling and DBS and spectrum all go together. I think that our  I think with the 600 megahertz auction and the way that that really solidified the spectrum position we have that it is  it would be easier to separate some of our assets than it was before. But I still think they belong together. I mean obviously, one could now make the case that the  both the AT&T DBS and the DISH DBS could go together and there would obviously be tremendous synergy and savings in doing that. And that because of all the OT  that because the competition  it wouldn't be going from 4 to 3, it would be going from 4 to 10 because of Sony and YouTube  Google and Hulu. Those are all real competitors to the DBS players today. So it's not a  it probably is not a regulatory issue today to put those companies together. And clearly, those companies together would be more value for both those companies than probably the market gives them credit for today. What was the other question? Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp. So, Marci, on SAC. On a per subscriber basis, the SAC has been relatively stable if you will, per addition on the underlying DBS ads as well as the Sling ads. It really depends on the mix associated with Sling relative to DBS. Just taking a step back and looking at the strategy. For DBS, we have been saying for several quarters now we are acquiring and retaining higher quality customers by refocusing on worldwide of these. We're more disciplined on credit and we're executing on several costs and revenue initiatives. And as we've already mentioned on the Sling side, we expect to see ARPU and margin expansion as it gains scale. For instance, we haven't fully monetized our Sling addressable advertising revenue opportunity yet. And then lastly, I already mentioned this in my preamble but for dishNET, given the wholesale economics, we believe it's the right time for us economically, which impacts SAC, and for our Pay-TV customers to pivot away from the wholesale model. So you'll see less absolute dollars running through the P&L associated with the dishNET ads, as we pivot away from the wholesale model. Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you very much. Operator And we'll take our next question from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead. Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. I had a question for Mr. Ergen. You talked about building a narrowband IoT network and also talked about looking at spectrum on the dollar per megahertz per thing basis as opposed to pop. I guess my question is this, do you really think in the next five years, there will be a business that is an IOT business, because maybe I'm too myopic, not forward thinking enough, but I sort of struggle with imagining a set of customers that could help your top line in the IoT space within five years. So if you could just elaborate on that a bit? Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Well, I guess I'd answer the question. IOT will be a huge business. And I wouldn't put the timeframe at five years. I think it will be evident to everyone within five years that it will be a huge business. Whether that will be just like the Internet was in the 1980s and people didn't realize that the Facebook and the Google were going to exist because of the  I think you're kind of in the same  I think it will go faster, but you're in the same situation where the possibility of Internet of Things is not going be  is going be underestimated long-term in terms of it just like the Internet was underestimated and the cloud has been underestimated. And now people are  the Fortune 500 companies of the future have been built from those businesses. So I think my  I believe Internet of Things will be huge. Whether we're sitting here five years from now, saying, it's X or Year, probably won't be that relevant because it's ultimately going be a thousand X at some point. It's just hard to put a timeframe on it. But you do need 5G so you're talking about 2021, probably 2022, to make it really work the way you want it to work. So I think  you already kind of have Internet of Things. I mean in a funny sort of way Facebook is Internet of Things, it just connects people to their social life, right? But when you can connect the city and your meters and your security and your lights and everything else, the city can be more efficient and the city can save money and so they're going to do it. And anything that's cheaper and better, you're going do, and the Internet of Things for sure is going to be cheaper and better. And I can think of a thousand things that need to get connected and there's probably another million things that we can't think of that other people will think of to be connected. And part of what we're looking at is our system to be open so that anybody who wants to participate in the network can invent things for the network. Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Thank you. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Operator, I think we have time for one more before we go to the press. Operator Sounds great. Thank you. We'll take our final question from the analyst community. Our final analyst question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC Thanks. Charlie, this is a question I think everybody has been trying to ask in lots of oblique ways, so let me just ask it a little more directly. How has your thinking evolved as to whether you would prefer to sell your spectrum, lease your spectrum, or lease the network, or just run it yourself? I guess as an outside observer, it would seem buying 600 megahertz spectrum is a lot more consistent with someone who actually wants to run a network than with someone who is looking to sell spectrum. Is that a reasonable interpretation of your participation in the auction? Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Well, I mean, I think one of the things you do when you start a business, you'd like that business to last more than 37 years, which is you'd like your business to last 100 years. So obviously we think pivoting to connectivity allows us to have a much longer runway for our company. But I think the way I would answer the question is, we're looking for whatever ultimately would enhance our shareholder value and our customers' and our employees' experience. And we think  at least today  we think that that is somebody who is looking at the wireless world in a disruptive manner that says the wireless connectivity in the United States is going to be different than four guys who you can make phone calls on and you can send a text and maybe you can stream a little bit of video, right, and you have an unlimited plan that's 22 gigs but they call it unlimited, so you have a limited unlimited plan. We think the world of wireless can be materially different than that. It can be different because there's a paradigm shift in technology, the way you build your radio, the way you're going to propagate your network, whether it be inside out, maybe inside out instead of outside in, whether your core and how you do your network, the ability to slice your network in different slices, the ability to let other people share your network. All those things are possible in the 5G world. And for somebody who shares that vision of where things can go, we could get pretty excited about. If somebody says we're going to just do the same thing we're doing today, we're not that interested in that because we don't think that builds long-term shareholder value for our shareholders. So we try to look at where things are going instead of where they are. Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC Thank you, Charlie. Operator We will now take questions from the members of the media. Our first media question comes from Scott Moritz with Bloomberg. Please go ahead. Scott Moritz - Bloomberg News Hey, thanks. Charlie, I guess I know it's only been four days, but have you folks received any kind of inquiries yet on deals? And are you surprised at all by the activity or lack of activity in that period? And also a second question. A lot of speculation around Sprint, T-Mobile, obviously. If that deal happens, would you feel like you needed to object to it, try to block it? Or would you feel there are still many other options available to you? Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Yeah. Scott, you've known us for a while. We don't  we won't  we're pretty private. I'm certainly a pretty private individual. So we're not going to comment in any way on discussions that take place, don't take place, rumors that are true, rumors that are not true, rumors that are outlandish, or whatever. We're just not going to comment on that. And our conversations that we have with people, we keep private. So you're not going read about them in the paper or a book. So that's just the way we do business and we're continuing to do that. Obviously, there could be consolidation within the industry. Certainly, Sprint and T-Mobile would be a possible combination of companies. And if there were to be a combination of companies, we'd take a look at it to see whether we thought that that combination was detrimental to the consumer or detrimental to competition or not. And we wouldn't be opposed to consolidation just because it's consolidation. We'd only be opposed to it if we thought it had an impact on competition. So, we haven't objected to some consolidations in the past out there. And others, we have. And I think we're kind of like the justice department. We look at each  and the FCC. We look at each case individually and try to make a judgment as to how that's going to affect competition. Operator We'll take our next question from Ben Markus with Colorado Public Radio. Please go ahead. Ben Markus - Colorado Public Radio Hi, guys. Just generally looking back at the last few quarters, how is it that subscriber base and revenue is eroding yet profits are going up? Are you just becoming more efficient as a company? Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Ben, it's a good  I think it's because we've really turned our investment to the future investment  the majority of our future investment to connectivity and obviously in spectrum purchases so that we can be a viable company in the 21st century. So the return on investment in a mature industry normally declines. So the return on investment from a customer that we would go out and spend $800 SAC from 10 years ago is a different profile than if we go spend $800 a SAC for a customer today given the rising cost of programming and the decline in viewership of traditional linear channels. So I think we're just trying to allocate our capital more precisely. And what that has led to is pretty flat revenue. I mean, most economic metrics over the last couple years have been pretty flat for us, but we're building for the future and so you, while you're investing in the future, you're not going to get those revenues from the future. So we're just building on our first networks. It's going to take us three years to build our network, so we're not going get a ton of revenue from our investment for three more years, right? And then we think that that jump starts a whole another growth phase for DISH. Operator We'll take our next question with Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US) Thanks. Question for Mr. Ergen. I'd just like to follow-up on your answer to Craig's question. Were you saying that effectively, if Verizon or AT&T wanted to buy your spectrum to support their existing business that you wouldn't sell it to them no matter what the price is? They have to share your vision of the future if you'd be willing to sell it? Or lease it to them? Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Jonathan, when did you get in the press? Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US) I... Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. You're such a great investment banker and analyst, you know, and now you're in the press? I didn't know that. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US) I'll do anything to speak to you, Mr. Ergen. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp. Well, I appreciate that. I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is that, obviously, this is a board decision. If somebody came in and said, here's cash offer and you looked at tax consequences that offer was more than you thought you could do with your business yourself, that's something that our board would consider. To extent that you took equity for something like that you'd want to make sure your equity was going go up in value more than staying your current course. And so those are all the kind of considerations that you'd want to have out there. But the  most management in public companies has a hard time taking a long view, right and making long-term investments, because they get pounded by everybody if their sales go down or their earnings per share missed by a penny or whatever. So they have a hard time, which is why you see crazy offers where you can get  I mean, you could get Apple TV box that costs $150 but you could get it for $105 if you sign up for three months of programming that probably costs $150. So in that particular case that company probably lost $300 on every customer they got. Well, why would you do that? You might do that for strategic reasons but we also want to make sure your numbers don't go down for Wall Street. Well, I'd prefer to save the $300 and then put it into something else that's going make money long-term. So we really think the wireless industry is right for a new way of doing things and a new way that you would build a network and new architecture, take advantage of 5G and the Internet of Things and I don't doubt that there are people within the incumbents today that share that vision, right? Whether they can get through their boards and take long-term measures, it might be a different story. But to extent, they could I think they'd be attractive people to talk to. Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US) Great. Thanks very much. Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.

(NASDAQ: DLTR ) Q1 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call May 25, 2017 09:00 AM ET Executives Randy Guiler - Vice President of Investor Relations Bob Sasser - Chief Executive Officer Kevin Wampler - Chief Financial Officer Gary Philbin - Enterprise President Analysts Alan Rifkin - BTIG Michael Lasser - UBS Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs Vincent Sinisi - Morgan Stanley Joseph Feldman - Telsey Group Alvin Concepcion - Citi Patrick McKeever - MKM Partners Operator Good day and welcome to the Dollar Tree First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Guiler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Randy Guiler Thank you, Christina. Good morning and welcome to our conference call to discuss Dollar Tree's performance for the first fiscal quarter of 2017. Participating on today's call will be our CEO, Bob Sasser; CFO, Kevin Wampler, and Enterprise President, Gary Philbin. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that various remarks that we will make about future expectations, plans and prospects for the Company constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements, as a result of various important factors. Included in our most recent press release, most recent 8-K, most recent 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K which are all on file with the SEC. We have no obligation to update our forward-looking statements and you should not expect us to do so. At the end of the first quarter, the receivable balance from Dollar Express related to the transition service agreement for the [technical difficulty] stores was $50.9 million. As discussed in our press release and financial tables, the Company has impartibly entire receivable. And additional receivable of $2 million or more from Dollar Express expected in the second quarter, which we anticipate will also be impaired. The Company plans to take all appropriate actions, which we expect to include litigation to enforce our rights. Thus, we are unable to provide further details or take any questions related to this matter. Unless otherwise noted, all SG&A, operating income, net income and earnings comparisons presented today do exclude the impact of the $50.9 million receivable impairment charge for the first quarter of 2017. Please refer to the table in todays press release for a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impairment charge. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Please limit your questions to one and one follow-up question if necessary. Now I will turn the call over to Bob Sasser, Dollar Trees Chief Executive Officer. Bob Sasser Thanks, Randy. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Consolidated sales for the first quarter increased 4% to $5.29 billion. Same-store sales increased 0.5%. By segment, same-store sales for the Dollar Tree banner increased 2.5% and for the Family Dollar banner same-store sales decreased 1.2%. Our combined gross margin rate improved 20 basis points to 30.8%; consolidated operating income increased 5% to $439.7 million; and our year-over-year consolidated operating margin improved from 8.2% to 8.3%. Total net income for the quarter was $232.1 million and our adjusted EPS of $0.98 met the high end of our range of guidance. Excluding the one-time tax planning benefit of $0.09 per share in the first quarter last year, our EPS grew by 10.1% from the adjusted $0.89 a year ago. I am extremely pleased with the first quarter performance for our Dollar Tree banner and with the continued progress in rebuilding the Family Dollar business. For the combined banners, total sales were near the mid-point of our range of guidance. Same-store sales were positive for our 37th consecutive quarter; consolidated gross margin and operating margin rates improved; SG&A expenses across both banners were well managed; and importantly, our adjusted EPS at the high-end of our range of guidance at $0.98 per diluted share. Performance of the Dollar Tree banner continues to be strong and consistent. Same-store sales increased 2.5%; sales markdown, including freight expense, improved; trade declined and our sector leading operating margin grew 50 basis points to 12.3%. Our Dollar Tree merchants and operators continue to raise the bar for sales and profitability. At Family Dollar, our customers are seeing cleaner stores, better product assortments, greater values, more consistent in-stocks and an elevated level of customer service. Im confident that each of these elements, over time, contributes to winning back repeat visits and share of wallet. But thats just the beginning. We are in the early stages with many of our key initiatives that are expected to bring continued improvement. Our remerchandising and renovation programs have just begun as we enter second quarter, and were confident that our customers will be thrilled with merchandise synergy and excitement in our stores as these initiatives gain traction. Our strategy is consistent and increasingly relevant, to deliver great values and convenience to our shoppers every day. With more than 6,400 Dollar Tree and more than 8,000 Family Dollar Stores, we have the unique opportunity and value retail to serve more customers through all types of markets. I believe we are in the most attractive sector in retail. Shoppers today are focused on value and convenience now more than ever, and thats exactly what Dollar Tree and Family Dollar Store provide, value and convenience. Looking forward, our banners are positioned for increased relevance to our customers, sustained growth and improved profitability. We have multiple opportunities to continue growing and improving our business. Our real estate and finance teams recently completed a rigorous analysis assessing the current store opportunity for each of our banners. As a result of their efforts and analysis, were now confident in our opportunity to operate more than 10,000 Dollar Trees and more than 15,000 Family Dollars across the United States. With a combined store count currently of approximately 14,200 stores in the U.S. we have many years of growth opportunity ahead. In addition to opening more stores, were keenly focused on increasing the productivity of all of our stores by leveraging our buying and operational synergies across banners, we have continued opportunity to increase sales, improve margin and manage expenses. With a keen focus on the customer, our goal is to maintain relevance in the market, offer extreme merchandise value and convenience, while operating stores with a full fun and friendly shopping experience. We plan to operate and grow both banners. At Dollar Tree, everything is a dollar. Family Dollar is your neighborhood discount store. We have the opportunity to serve customers with one or the other or both banners, depending on the market and customer demographics. Our Dollar Tree Canada business continues to perform extremely well. Our merchant and store teams in Canada are doing a terrific job in managing their business. Their efforts in serving our Canadian customers are resulting in annual improvements and store productivity. Comp sales in our Canadian stores outpaced our Company average in the first quarter, driven by increases in both average ticket and customer count. Leveraging the size and scale of Dollar Tree, our merchants continue to source higher value product, and our customers are finding broader and more exciting assortments and better values in Dollar Tree Canada stores. We want to be recognized by customers as the leading retailer in Canada at the single price point of CAD1.25, just as we are in the United States at the $1 price point. We now operate 225 stores in Canada and believe we have an opportunity for 1,000 stores over time. In addition to Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree Canada, our online business at Dollar Tree Direct is growing in size and performance. Doll Tree Direct provides an opportunity to broaden our customer base, to drive incremental sales, expand brand awareness and attract more customers into our stores. While Dollar Tree Direct is a relatively small component when compared to our overall business, I continue to be very pleased with the year-over-year trend we are seeing in both traffic and sales. And we're seeing material increase in number of visits from mobile devices. We strive to run world-class stores and engage with our customers via conventional and digital marketing channels such as email Facebook, Pinterest, Craft Videos, Twitter and more. And I invite you to check us out at dollartree.com. In April, we announced the location for Dollar Tree's 12th distribution center; it will be in Warrensburg, Missouri less than 60 miles Southeast of Kansas City. We plan to break grounds soon our new 1.2 million square foot facility, which will be operational by the end of second quarter 2018, and will support our continued store growth in the Midwest. This $110 million project will create approximately 375 jobs for Johnson County Missouri and surrounding communities within three years. Now, I'll turn the call over to Gary to provide more detail on our performance and our priorities.  Gary Philbin Thank you, Bob. Good morning everyone. We're pleased with our overall performance for the first quarter as we met the top end of our EPS guidance range. But we know we're certainly capable of doing better. Retail environment was dynamic and we saw a number of factors impact our business. These included delays in tax refunds and a shift in the timing of Easter. We continue to focus our efforts to achieve continuous improvement and drive our key business initiatives that are aligned to deliver better in-store shopping experience, top-line sales growth margin enhancements and effective cost management. For the quarter, our enterprise same store sales increased by 0.5%. For the Dollar Tree banner, total sales in Q1 increased 7.9% to $2.57 billion and same store sales increased 2.5%. This was achieved through increases in comp transaction count and average tickets. Gross profit margin improved 50 basis points over Q1 last year and first quarter operating margin was 12.3%, an improvement of 50 basis points over last year's 11.8%. Dollar Tree highlights for the quarter include sales in the top performing categories; snacks and beverage, candy, toys, seasonal products and healthcare products; sales performance was led by our consumables line of business in both consumables and discretionary comp positively for the quarter; as we expected April, which benefited from the Easter shift, was the strongest same-store sales of the quarter.  Geographically, Dollar Tree same store sales growth was strongest in the Midwest, Northeast and Southwest and each of our operating zones delivered positive comps greater than 1%. The Dollar Tree business continues to be strong, consistent and growing. This represent our 37th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales and our operating margin continues to lead the value structure. Our first quarter performance continues to validate the relevance of the Dollar Tree brand. Customers continue to shop for value and convenience. For the Family Dollar banner, total sales increased 0.5% to $2.72 billion and same same-store sales decreased 1.2%. The first quarter represent our toughest prior year comp comparison we will face in 2017. On a two year stack basis, for the first quarter, comps were positive for the Family Dollar banner. Gross profit margin declined 30 basis points to 26.9% and operating margin was 4.6%. For Family Dollar, the highlights for the quarter include the sales in our top performing categories; snacks & beverage, health & beauty care and mens apparel. Our comp performance was driven by consumables, which comp positively slightly in the first quarter. Timing of sales through the first quarter was impacted by various factors, including the material delays and the timing of tax rate funds, later Easter holiday and cycling of the staff benefit reductions from 2016. As a result, our comps by month varied from mid single-digit negative for February to mid single-digit positive for April. Geographically, Family Dollar same-store sales growth for the quarter was relatively balanced with the west, Mid-Atlantic and mountain west zones being the strongest. Less than two years into our integration, we continue to make meaningful progress at Family Dollar around the key foundational elements that will drive performance. Our store table stakes focus on merchandizing value and the consolidation of shared services. Our efforts are focused towards our customer facing initiatives that the shoppers continue to give us credit for and we are working to improve and scale these across all 8,000 stores. Our customers are seeing, clearing a better merchandize stores to have more compelling end cuts with pricing for everyday basics and holiday wants. And while we have more to do at Family Dollar, we are on the right track with our continued investment in the basics of our Family Dollar brand; these customer facing programs to drive and show value throughout the store, and tend to lead the momentum for our smart way to save marketing problem. Our customers continue to respond to the value and savings across all of these elements; delivering value for our Family Dollar customers; our smart way to save messaging reflects the values and the execution of the merchandizing in our stores. This includes our EDLP pricing on everyday value; sale items that reflect most meaningful value on key items; Dollar well that drives the surprise and opening price points throughout the store; compare and save to shut out the excellent value of our private brands; price drop, great value on the items our customers buy most often; and smart coupons, the easy way to find additional savings. We believe our customers are giving us credit across the store on our smart way to save and that gives us flexibility to drive value and convenience for our customers fill and shopping trip. In particular, our customers are continuing to respond and embrace smart coupons with more than 2.5 million customers enrolled since our Labor Day 2016 kick-off. For our regular shoppers, this program provides the no hassle shopping experience to national and Family Dollar exclusive offers. We are seeing a measurable lift in the average ticket for the transactions where a smart coupon has been applied. For Family Dollar is a great way for us and our suppliers to reach a customer demographic thats uniquely served by Family Dollar, it enhance the delivery of our smart ways to save message. Over the past 18 months, weve invested a significant amount of time, test and learn effort to improve to our Family Dollar store layout. We are pleased with results we are seeing and now this is the format we will be utilizing for both our new stores and current renovation programs. We believe our customers will respond enthusiastically to this format as we roll down in months ahead. Elements for the layout, include; improved adjacencies and more productive end caps; expanded beverage and snack, including immediate consumption core near checkout; expanded assortment of food and coolers and freezers; and updated airfare assortment expanded the beverage in some stores; and efficient power alley to promote Dollar well items and affect through checkout process for the customers. Our first renovations have started in earnest in Q2 and we look forward to making progress in our target of 250 or more renovations this year. As performance becomes measurable and predictable, we have the ability and intention to ramp up accordingly. Most new stores will now open with our assortment and adjacencies that reflects our latest thinking of our report. Another key element of driving improvement in the Family Dollar business is the development of our private brand program. Were in the process of moving away from family branded label such as Family Wellness, Family Gourmet and Family Chef with the intention to drive relevant brandings with new and improve packaging to refresh our assortment. Some of these examples in our stores a day, you will see Homeline replacing Family Dollar brand in household products. You also see were transitioning from our private brand candy assortment from Family Gourmet where you will now see candy Company. In the months ahead, well be transitioning labels in several other pipelines mainly on the consumables categories. These private brands are being developed to provide national brand comparable quality and terrific values to support the compare and save component of our smart ways to save program. Each of our brands will continue the 100% customer satisfaction guarantee. We look forward to providing you update on our progress in the quarters ahead on this important program. While we have more to do, our team at Family Dollar is motivated and energized to be the best to delivering value to our shoppers that are unique in many ways and often underserved. Our store serve the customer that counts on us and responds and redeliver value convenience for quick trips in a small format and a Family Dollar shopping experience that backs up our promise of friendly service. Now looking at real estate in the first quarter; we opened a total of 164 new stores, 89 Dollar Trees, 75 Family Dollars; we relocated or expanded 51 stores, 35 Dollar Trees, 16 Family Dollars; a total 215 projects during the first quarter; we also added freezers and coolers into 131 Dollar Tree stores during the first quarter; bringing our total Dollar Tree stores with freezers and coolers to 4,918. During the quarter, we closed 16 stores, five Dollar Trees and 11 Family Dollars; and we ended the first quarter with 14,482 stores, 6,444 were Dollar Tree, and 8,038 were Family Dollars. Ill now turn the call over to Kevin to provide more detail on our first quarter performance and our outlook for Q2 and the full year. Kevin? Kevin Wampler Thank you, Gary. I would like to remind everyone that our discussion, as previously noted, excludes the effect of the $0.13 per share receivable impairment charge, unless otherwise noted. Total sales for the first quarter grew 4% to $5.29 billion. Dollar Tree segment total sales increased 7.9% to $2.57 billion, and Family Dollar segment total sales increased 0.5% to $2.72 billion. Enterprise same-store sales increased 0.5%. Aiding currency fluctuations had minimal impact on our comps during the quarter. On a segment basis, same-store sales for the Dollar Tree banner increased 2.5% and for the Family Dollar banner decreased 1.2%. As expected, we experienced incremental cannibalization from Family Dollar and deals stores that have been converted to Dollar Tree stores. We estimate the incremental cannibalization impact to the Dollar Tree banner comp to be approximately 30 basis points for the quarter. Gross profit for the combined organization increased 4.7% to $1.63 billion for the first quarter 2017 compared to the prior years quarter. As a percent of sales, gross profit margin improved 20 basis points to 30.8% versus 30.6% in the prior years quarter. Gross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment was 34.9% for the first quarter, a 50 basis points improvement compared with the prior years fourth quarter. Factors impacting the segments gross margin performance during the quarter included lower merchandise costs, favorable freight costs and lower shrink as a result of favorable inventory results; partially offset by higher distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales, resulting primarily from our Cherokee County South Carolina DC opening in Q2 of last year. Gross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment was 26.9% during the first quarter compared with 27.2% in the comparable prior year period. The 30 basis point decrease was primarily due to higher markdown and shrink expense in the quarter, partially offset by improved merchandise costs. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in the quarter increased to 22.5% from 22.3% in the same quarter last year. Q1 SG&A expense for the Dollar Tree segment as a percentage of sales was consistent when compared to the prior years quarter at 22.6%. Higher store payroll costs and stock compensation were offset by lower health insurance costs, lower store supply and professional fees as a percentage of sales. SG&A expense for the Family Dollar segment as a percentage of sales was 22.3% compared to 22.1% in the prior years quarter. The increase was a result of higher payroll costs, resulting from loss of leverage from the comp sales decrease and higher advertising costs, partially offset by lower depreciation costs and lower store repairs and maintenance costs. Operating income for the Enterprise increased to $439.7 million compared with $418.7 million in the same period last year. Operating income margin increased to 8.3% for the quarter from 8.2% in last years first quarter. Operating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment improved 50 basis points to 12.3% when compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income for the Family Dollar segment decreased $13.7 million to $124.3 million, a 50 basis point decline as a percentage of sales when compared to the prior years quarter. Non-operating expenses for the quarter totaled $75 million, which was comprised primarily of net interest expense. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 36.1% compared to 29.8% of prior year's quarter. Prior year's quarter included a one-time benefit related to the state tax planning. For the first quarter, company has net income of $232.1 million or $0.89 per share compared to the reported net income of $232.7 million or $0.98 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter. Prior year included $0.09 one-time benefit to the EPS and a lower than anticipated tax rate as previously noted. Excluding the $0.09 one-time benefit for the prior year quarter diluted earnings per share of improved 10.1% for the adjusted $0.89. Combined cash and cash equivalents at quarter end totaled $1.15 billion compared to $866.4 million at the end of fiscal 2016. Our outstanding long-term debt is approximately $6.3 billion. Inventory for the Dollar Tree segment at quarter end was essentially flat to the same time last year, while selling square footage increased 6.5%. Inventory per selling square foot decreased 6.1%. We believe the current inventory levels are appropriate to support scheduled new store openings in our sales initiatives for the second quarter. Inventory for the Family Dollar segment at the quarter end decreased 3% from the same period last year, and decreased 4.2% on a selling square foot basis. We continue to be pleased with the progress we are seeing in our in stock levels on key items. We are continuing to review merchandise assortments and believe our current inventory levels are appropriate for the second quarter.  Capital expenditures were $110.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 versus $175.9 million in the first quarter last year. For fiscal 2017, we're planning for consolidated capital expenditures to range from $760 million to $780 million. Capital expenditures, will be focused on new stores and remodels, including fee development stores; renovating 250 Family Dollar stores in 2017; the addition of further refrigerated capabilities for a total 400 new and existing Dollar Tree stores; the expansion of frozen and refrigerated of 300 Family Dollar stores IT system enhancements and integration projects; start up construction of our new Dollar Tree banner distribution center Warrensburg, Missouri; and the continued build-out of a new office building for the Store support center here in Chesapeake, Virginia. Depreciation and amortization totaled $153.9 million for the first quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense was $162.3 million for the first quarter of last year. For fiscal 2017, we expect consolidated depreciation and amortization to range from $610 million to $630 million. Our updated outlook for fiscal 2017 includes the following assumptions; fiscal 2017 anticipate 53rd week, the extra week in the fourth quarter is expected to add $400 million to $430 million of sales and $0.19 to $0.22 to earnings per diluted share, both of which are included in guidance. We expect continued pressure on store payroll based on state increasing minimum wages and general average hourly rate increases. We have budget higher import freight costs in the year ago starting in Q2 and higher diesel costs for the year. Net interest expense will be approximately $75 million per quarter in Q2 and Q3 and approximately $81 million in Q4 due to the extra week. Our guidance does not include any share repurchase for 2017, and we cannot predict future currency fluctuations where we have not adjusted our guidance for changes in currency rates. Our guidance also assumes a tax rate of 36% from the second quarter and 36.5% for fiscal 2017. Weighted average diluted share counts assumed to be 237.7 million shares for both Q2 and the full year. For the second quarter, we are forecasting total sales to range from $5.18 billion to $5.28 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.80 to $0.88. This represents an increase of 11% to 22% over the $0.72 reported EPS for Q2 last year. These estimates are based on a slightly positive, the low single-digit same-store sales increase and year-over-year growth of 3.4%. For fiscal 2017, were now forecasting total sales to range between $21.95 billion and $22.25 billion compared to the Companys previously expected range of $21.94 billion to $22.33 billion. The Company now anticipates diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 will range between $4.17 and $4.43, which includes the $0.13 receivable impairment charge. Excluding the $0.13 impairment charge, the top of the guidance range is consistent with our prior guidance. These estimates are based on a slightly positive to low single digit same-store sales increase and 3.9% square footage growth and includes the benefit of the 53rd week occurring in Q4 of fiscal 2017. Ill now turn the call back to Bob. Bob Sasser Thanks Kevin. Again, Im extremely pleased with another terrific first quarter performance at Dollar Tree and Im equally enthusiastic about what lies ahead of us at Family Dollar. The teams have worked incredibly hard at rebuilding the foundation for a very successful and profitable business. I believe that were well positioned in the most attractive sector of retail to deliver continued growth and increase value for our long-term shareholders. Dollar Tree is now a diversified combination of 6,000 store chain and an 8,000 store chain each with its unique ability to effectively serve more customers through all types of markets. With the combination of these two great brands, we have great flexibility in how we choose to grow while expanding our opportunity to grow. We will continue to focus on providing greater values to our customers, while delivering superior returns to our long-term shareholders. The Dollar Tree business model continues to grow and improve; its powerful, flexible and more relevant than ever providing extreme value to customers while recording record levels of sales and earnings. While our price point has remained the same $1 for the past 30 years now, our operating margin continues to grow and lead the discount sector. As always, we will continue to employ a thoughtful disciplined approach to driving key strategic initiatives to the combined enterprise through improved communication, analysis, collaboration and incentives. Most importantly, we will maintain a laser focus on the customer, maintaining relevance to their needs and above all delivering value, convenience and a full fun and friendly shopping experience. Our fundamentals have been tested by time and validated by results, we are confident that continuing to place our emphasis in these areas can materially enhance the operating performance at Family Dollar with improvements in sales, margin, expense control and greater customer satisfaction. Through good times and difficult times in all retail cycles, consumers are looking for value and convenience no matter the state of the economy. At Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, we have both. It all starts with our associates, our merchandize teams and our field management and leadership teams, our talented, experienced, energized and incredibly motivated. Its a great time to be Dollar Tree. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Question-And-Answer Session Operator Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Well take our first question from Alan Rifkin with BTIG. Alan Rifkin Bob, can you maybe just provide an update on where you are with the expected synergies now that almost two years through the acquisition. I recall your original guidance speaks 300 million and even this last quarter you said you remained comfortable with that number. Could you please give us an update there? Bob Sasser We are confident with the 300 million that we have guided to. We feel very -- we feel like were squarely in the zone where we need to be at this time. As you remember there was 300 million run rate synergies by the end of third full year with an investment of 300 million to achieve those. So I can tell you that were right on target to achieve the 300 million. Alan Rifkin And could you just tell us the Missouri DC that will be added. Will that emulates the St. George DC, which was fulfilling both banners, and now that youve had some time to take a looking and evaluate the St. George. Whats the prognosis for the DC supporting both banners, which I believe would give you a significant supply chain savings? Thank you. Bob Sasser Alan, its another good question. The Missouri DC will -- we will be using catalyst, which is the WMS that we use in our Family Dollar DC, its also the one that we modified in St. George Utah in order to ship both banner. So were taking the modify version of the St. George WMS and were going to open the new Missouri DC with that WMS. That will be our go to WMS as we open and continue to expand or convert distribution centers as we go forward. Operator Well take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser As you put in all the hard work with Family Dollar, have cleaner store its been in stock, elevated levels of customer service. Surely you didnt expect comp down 1% is or in your experience with this business. Why do you think its not better than this? Gary Philbin I think the sale of Q1 really speaks to what happened in the marketplace, especially on the tax refund. So just to give you a little color; obviously, one knows the tax refunds are delayed. In particular, the earned income tax credit was delayed to week of 27th. In fact you could see by day when it actually hit. So when we take a look at the quarter period one month of February not only was impacted by the discretionary piece of the business that our customers weighed on because that tax refund and spend but really becomes a capital investment for them and that was delayed until really the last week; and while we saw that pop compared to year ago that was probably two-week shift and go back two years and really was in entire month of February. As we went through March, even with the shift in Easter, we were on track with where we thought sales would be for March. And I think Easter at Family Dollar was in the target zone too. So if you got back to a regular cadence, we could see our customer respond. So clearly, were never happy when we see a negative comp. But what we could measure qualify and see both across just top-line sales and as you go down to a line of business was a delay in the income tax credit that our customer experienced in the month of February. I don't think it's anything structurally different with the business. We continue to invest, I think, in the right things in our business, invest in clear stores, get exciting merchandising on end caps and on the frontend of the stores, give our folks a reason to drive comp store sales. Those are the things that we're going to build over the long run that's going to drive the business. So were very focused as we go into May into second quarter businesses back to focus on what's going to happen in the summer season, and for Family Dollar that means grow out. For Dollar Tree that means we're in midst to just passing Mother's Day graduations or in full bloom and Memorial Day is ahead of us. We have the right product the store to drive Q2 business, and we're focused on doing that across both banners. Michael Lasser Thank you, Gary. And my follow up questions is, first, do you think Easter shift and can you quantify how much Easter shift contributed to the mid-single digit comp that you experienced at Family Dollar in April. And now that we're -- now that SNAP drag from last year has been anniversary. Do you think that cause income improvement in the business that should continue into the second quarter and beyond? Gary Philbin Michael, Ive missed the second part of the questions. What was the second, [multiple speakers], thank you. So for the first part, I think -- listen our later Easter helps Dollar Tree tremendously and Family Dollar, not only is it the Easter Holiday it really becomes the kick up to spring. So while we hadnt qualified it for enterprise, both banners had a better Easter than the year ago, because of just warmer spring weather and the Family Dollar that also means some of our other categories outside of peer Easter apparel, health and beauty responded the right way. Secondly, on staff benefits I told you before at Family Dollar I view it as sort of the canary and the mind shaft, listen it's a small piece of our business. To me, it gives us a great every first of month how we're doing. And while we know benefits of what the market at the Family Dollar banner, weve seen it all consistently to last year. At Dollar Tree penetration is down a little bit, but I think that speaks to a little more of Dollar Tree was doing first the month and getting ready for us. And at Family Dollar, its really been our focus now. So I think it shows up in our staff benefits. It gives us confidence that we're getting ready on first of month in a better way across our stores. They have -- its spread out by state differently, but first 10 days are still so important for our Family Dollar customer to getting ready being in stock and having our folks ready to give great service. Operator Our next question comes from Stephen Tanal Goldman Sachs. Stephen Tanal I guess, I've been most focused to start on the Family Dollar margin rate. And I'd be curious to know kind of how you're thinking about both the level in Q1 and how the year-on-year should trend over the balance of the year? And then any comments maybe on a longer term levels that are achievable in that business will be helpful. Gary Philbin Let me start off Stephen. Q1 was -- besides the sales in the items that impacted us a year ago, we were coming out of our cleanup of inventory. We got the benefit of both the fact that we start off with great strength at the beginning of 2016, we just cleans up a lot of the dribs and drabs that had accumulated in store. We also came out of the winter time with basically cleaned up in a nice way on apparel too. So once you sale on some of the margin piece, just maybe back to normal cadence, we can only do better, but a normal cadence of where we are on strength and our markdowns in Q1. But again, the one thing that was really different in period one because of the tax refunds being late was the mix shift, and the impact on what our customer buys. Our consumables were slightly positive for the quarter. They bought what they needed to get by. The difference of what they wanted to buy across the discretionary departments and its really what we felt in period one that we could measure that impacted margins in a big way for the quarter. So that was a story for Q1. But Kevin I think comment on the forecast, but obviously we've put everything that we know at this point into our forecast for the balance of the year. Kevin Wampler So I think consistent on a consolidated basis with what we said last quarter; if you would look at a range of guidance, the mid-point of our operating income is roughly an 88 or 89 basically. And also that compares to I think about H2 last year. So also, we're overall expecting improvement. As part of that, we do expect to see the Dollar business, as we go through the year, improve upon where we were during Q1. So I think there is an expectation overall that the business will improve there and as we go forward. So had some -- Gary mentioned, some various timing thing that affected Q1 a little bit more than maybe expected, but we're looking for some better things as we go forward. Stephen Tanal And then just the follow up, I think you said the synergies, maybe the one-time costs there that are flowing through OpEx. Can you maybe give us an update, was that a net benefit or a net drag year-on-year and how that will play out as well? Kevin Wampler Well, I don't know how to speak to it from a drag or a benefit. I think obviously the cost that we're going to be spending that we're aware of are in our forecast as always along with the associated synergies that we're expecting this year. So that's no different than any other time. From an overall standpoint, we said $300 million to achieve a little bit more frontend loaded. And again that was true if you remember right we re-bannered basically 300 stores, 300 Family Dollar stores, we re-bannered 200 Dollar deal store to Dollar Tree. So there was a lot of CapEx costs associated with that in the first year and half basically, so that was a big part of it. As I said before, when we started this process, we said that the $300 million our best guess was OpEx half CapEx. And as Ive said as we went through this, its probably been little bit more CapEx at the end of the day and little less OpEx. But again, still have been our targeted range of what we would expected from the beginning from an achievement standpoint as well as a cost to achieve. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi You said earlier in the call that you feel like youve gotten the basically the format for Family Dollar in place now that you kind of use going forward. Can you just give us a sense for do you think that in terms of the pricing versus competition, you feel like youve kind of have the majority behind you and that youre in good shape going forward there; of course, tweaks and what not, but maybe just around pricing? And then also just in terms of the buying synergies, any sense for between the two banners, how much overlap there is in there and how much maybe more is to be realized? Gary Philbin Let me comment on the pricing, I think they were in retail were going to pay attention just about a weekly basis. And so clearly, while were pleased with what the format does because I think it makes some logical adjacencies for our customers to shop Family Dollar in a more productive and easier way for the customer that shows value. When it comes to pricing, we still are going to highlight the smart way to save, which our customer responds to across all the elements that weve been talking about. Weve got to show everyday prices on the shelf. We got have price drop, sale items that resonate with them on the things they buy most often. Compare and save. But were excited about this private brand redo and make it because we have a pretty good private brand program, but the values that we can show our customer and now were freshening up the label as we think will go a long way. But the pricing piece will continue to be something we watch now and going through, its just the nature of the beast as we make sure that we have the right retails on shelf and gives us flexibility with the smart ways to save whether electronic with smart coupons are on the shelf. Synergy, I would tell you that merchants work together on a couple of different elements. One we basically think about it in two ways, one its our domestic supplier. So what we have maybe about 10% overlap of between skews, its bigger than that when we consider some of the similar items we buy; so aluminum foil might be that poster child, were most likely five square feet at Dollar Tree bigger size for Family Dollar. But I would tell you on the import side, there is also an opportunity that we want to cycle through those buying trips four times a year. So we get four chances to get our integration going and have the merchants talk about whats going to be bought for the following years. So keep in mind as youre taking a look at some of the import side, the lead time is longer whats to show up in the synergy takes that amount of time for us to review our assortment to buy it, ship it, take it through the holidays then we revamp and redo for the following season. Well have more of it. There is certainly more opportunities for us to continue above and beyond what we had targeted to drive synergies. And I would say as much as anything reviewing assortments and driving excitement inside the assortment. Vincent Sinisi And maybe just as a fast follow-up, just now with the Family Dollar format kind of fully in place. Any qualitative or quantitative way we should think about footage growth annually by banner more of the split in there kind of post this year? Thanks very much. Gary Philbin We havent really spoken to that, I would just tell you maybe what excites us from a customer perspective is the way they shop the store across the categories that weve invest in. I mentioned immediate consumption. Our front-end thats more productive the fact that you can party and toys and gift cards are now in similar adjacencies that a mom who comes in the store can buy new born infant, toddler apparel next the diapers. So just some maybe retail one-o-one items that I think just drives better business and make it easier for our customer to shop. Operator And our next question comes from Joseph Feldman with Telsey Group. Joseph Feldman So wanted to go back also on Family Dollar business. Are you -- can you help us understand when we should start to see the operating margin improvement, I guess, accelerate? I think certainly there are some out there, including myself, that would have thought that wed be seeing a little bit better margin improvement, not necessarily gross, but just overall operating margin improvement at the Family Dollar business at this point. And I just wanted to get your sense of timing on that? Bob Sasser I think a couple of combinations. I think youve heard us talk about the foundation of things that were putting in; we said were in this for the long run. And weve done the things that we think as on the right path for running better stores, better assortments, better value on shelf; I think what were describing, what the renovation program now and something and thats maybe a little more visible for our customer to see, which also is going to be one of the engines that helps us drive overall margin growth; so as we do our 250 renovations this year as the new stores come out with the new format. Now, our customers is going to see something in fiscal way in a store thats cleaner, fuller, fresher and thats really another piece to the puzzle here that weve been focused on to say lets change the complexion of the fleet of stores and thats what youre going to see in the back half of this year. And I am anxious to get those out of ground, because I think those are the elements that combined with all the things weve been talking about; table stakes, merchandising energy in store assortments. But we also have to touch the fiscal plan to these facilities to make sure our customer sees a nice new fresh store when theyre going to make a decision of where theyre going to shop. So its hand-in-hand, we got to do both. Youve heard us to talk and about really in the first portion at this point in the renovation new store program is really next piece to this. Joseph Feldman And then just as a follow-up. With regard to some of the clearance activity, I guess not clearance, but with the rebranding of the private label, I guess. Im curious how that will impact the clearance of the older inventory and how thats baked into your outlook? Bob Sasser I would say in most cases, were just flowing at the high of the whether its the candy or whether its the trash bags; most of these consumables, they turns pretty quickly. And while we may have some, its all baked into our forecast. Most of these are going to be flow throughs with the existing SKU on the shelf being replaced by a new package. Operator And our next question comes from Alvin Concepcion with Citi. Alvin Concepcion Last quarter, I think you mentioned, you hadnt seen much change in the past year and half in the competitive promotional environment. Did you see that stability continue to 1Q and further into the second quarter? Bob Sasser I think competitions always part of our life. I watch intensely as does field operators and our merchants and what the competitors are doing from a couple of points of view are they doing with merchandise mix and businesses that theyre driving, as well as price, the pricing statements that theyre making. So we continue to shop. We see a lot of -- there is a lot of new competition out there, or coming in, especially in the grocery business. Were not a grocery store but we still sell some food and sell beverage and snacks and those types of product. So were watching that intensely. But at the same time, we remain focused on our customer, what our customers needs are and how do we put together that value equation for our customers. Gary was taking a Family Dollar that all the different ways to save with our add prices and our every day prices and price drops, which are surprising price value to our customers. So were going to stay focused on that; were going to watch what the competition does; were going to shop the price on key items, name brand items as we always have diligently; its different by market; we pay attention across the country. And were doing to evolve our business based on what our customers need. This new renovation program is just rolling up in second quarter, and were really excited about it, because it does take a lot of the components that weve been talking about and testing in different stores and puts some together. So our new stores are starting to rollout with the new adjacencies with the new mix of products, with the new store designs, as well as going back and renovating. Right now, were seeing 250 stores obviously based on performance we got put on the accelerator that exceeds expectations we certainly would jump on all over it. And then the other thing is radically rollout the renovations. The things that we found that are really compelling to the customers to the new stores we still have the ability to roll pieces in parts out to the existing fleet where we know its going to be a home run. So competition is retail, retail is competition. I have great respect for all of them. Were going to keep watching them and were especially going to stay focused on the customer and how they respond to what we offer in our stores. Alvin Concepcion And just a quick follow-up on the comps. It sounds like youre seeing more normalized trends in the second quarter, enough to give you confidence in the annual number. Just wondering if you could give us some more color on what youre seeing in second quarter since they were many issues in 1Q you called out? Bob Sasser I wish I could tell you exactly, but it's early. Yes, we feel good about our guidance we have all that we know embedded into our guidance for second quarter. We have a lot of -- still that was just early on in the quarter; Mother's Day was good; this weekend is Memorial Day holiday; and were expecting good things from that; and of course graduations based in our Dollar Tree business, is a big idea; and the Father's day and beyond. At Family Dollar it's all those things plus a bigger seasonal summer offering, because at Family Dollar we sell fans. So when it gets hot, we can sell lots more fans and beach supplies and coolers and charcoal grills and all the things we're cooking out. This should be a big weekend for that, as well as the apparel business at Family Dollar. As the weather warms, as we get bright blue sunny skies were seeing the apparel business take off; so there is a lot of bright spot. And just to step back and I would tell you that the big issue once more in first quarter on sales at Family Dollar was the delay in the tax refund checks. They were late and the business was in February was stubborn and difficult. But when the checks it you could see it day-by-day and you could see improvement in the sales. And then we came in to March where we lost Easter at pretty good March and met our expectations. We had a good Easter, but we could not make up what we lost in February. And that's the story that you see. Our discretionary business is what suffered, our consumer -- the things that they needed even with a bad -- with getting the checks like what they brought what they needed. So our consumable business was slightly up over the quarter, but our discretionary businesses were all of the comp decrease was. So that really is the story, but what happened at Family Dollar is it was structural it was do with our new assortments, it was more to do with just way things spell on those tax check, especially for that low income customer which we have a lot of Family Dollar. These tax checks to those lowest income customers they wait for them they count on them, and that's when they buy things like clothing and that's when they buy the things that they'd like to have but just can't afford to have of the times of the year. Operator We have time for one more question. Our question is from Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners. Patrick McKeever I'll just ask a couple of big picture questions, first of all, on the border adjusted tax. Just wondering, I know it's very iffy as to what happens there, but if that something that you're thinking about and is there any kind of contingency planning that things around it if it were to come to be? And then second question is just Bob, I know the past few conference calls you've had somewhat cautious comments about the economic well being of the -- of your core customer. And I know that later tax refunds were a big issue in the first quarter. But just thinking about your core customer, do you still feeling little cautious, or do you feel like things are getting better there? Bob Sasser Well, to that first of all, the border adjustable tax is still out there, still being debated in Congress. And I was watch on last night, night before last, reruns on C-SPAN of the House Ways and Means Committee and as they were talking to some retailers about the border adjustable tax and trying to get more tax and frame their position on that. It is still up in the air, its not until we know what it is we really dont know how to organize around it. I think were doing exactly what we should be doing and paying attention to it and trying to understand it as well as whats going and talking to our congressmen, talking to our senators, working with RILA and the other groups that are out there supporting retail and putting our position forward. So thats what were doing, and were actively been doing that and well see how it goes. I dont want to sit here and prognosticate one way or other what Congress will do it. But I think at the end of the day hopefully they will get it right and well have good result to this. So they are on to initiatives going on right now what is this and what is that; there is too many what ifs and too many open questions to make anything meaningful right now. So I would do exactly what we need to be doing right now, Patrick. On the health of the consumer, we serve the lowest consumer up through middle income consumers. So we serve a broad swath of consumers out there and I believe what I said in the past that the consumer was under pressure and concerned. I still think thats the case, and I think some of the -- whether its the economic questions that are out there with healthcare and Healthcare Reform and tax reform, and all of the issues that were working with at Congress. I think all of those had uncertainty as long as there is uncertainty, then the American consumer is -- theyre focused on being the light bill; they are focused on paying the rent, house payment, care payment; all the things; employment, will have a job, do I have a job until you get confident in their position that they do have a job and they cant pay the bills; theres going to be continue to be uncertainty. At Dollar Tree and at Family Dollar, we card every day to be one of the answers to their issues as they strive to balance their budgets, as they try to take their paycheck and spread it across the month, for the week, whatever the pay cycle is. We want to be part of the solution to their issues. We want to help them balance their budget by the things they want at great prices, great values surprising value. And at Dollar Tree you can slur because everything is still a dollar. Yes you can afford it at Dollar Tree you can go in and have a great party birthday party for the kids and for the family buys your seasonal product and still pay only a dollar. Operator And that concludes todays question-and-answer session. Mr. Guiler, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Randy Guiler Great, thank you, Christina. Thank you for joining us for todays call and for your continued interest in Dollar Tree. Our next quarterly earnings conference call to discuss Q2 results is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, August 24, 2017. Thank you and have a good day. Operator This concludes todays call.

Operator Our next question comes from Stephen Tanal Goldman Sachs. Stephen Tanal I guess, I've been most focused to start on the Family Dollar margin rate. And I'd be curious to know kind of how you're thinking about both the level in Q1 and how the year-on-year should trend over the balance of the year? And then any comments maybe on a longer term levels that are achievable in that business will be helpful. Gary Philbin Let me start off Stephen. Q1 was -- besides the sales in the items that impacted us a year ago, we were coming out of our cleanup of inventory. We got the benefit of both the fact that we start off with great strength at the beginning of 2016, we just cleans up a lot of the dribs and drabs that had accumulated in store. We also came out of the winter time with basically cleaned up in a nice way on apparel too. So once you sale on some of the margin piece, just maybe back to normal cadence, we can only do better, but a normal cadence of where we are on strength and our markdowns in Q1. But again, the one thing that was really different in period one because of the tax refunds being late was the mix shift, and the impact on what our customer buys. Our consumables were slightly positive for the quarter. They bought what they needed to get by. The difference of what they wanted to buy across the discretionary departments and its really what we felt in period one that we could measure that impacted margins in a big way for the quarter. So that was a story for Q1. But Kevin I think comment on the forecast, but obviously we've put everything that we know at this point into our forecast for the balance of the year. Kevin Wampler So I think consistent on a consolidated basis with what we said last quarter; if you would look at a range of guidance, the mid-point of our operating income is roughly an 88 or 89 basically. And also that compares to I think about H2 last year. So also, we're overall expecting improvement. As part of that, we do expect to see the Dollar business, as we go through the year, improve upon where we were during Q1. So I think there is an expectation overall that the business will improve there and as we go forward. So had some -- Gary mentioned, some various timing thing that affected Q1 a little bit more than maybe expected, but we're looking for some better things as we go forward. Stephen Tanal And then just the follow up, I think you said the synergies, maybe the one-time costs there that are flowing through OpEx. Can you maybe give us an update, was that a net benefit or a net drag year-on-year and how that will play out as well? Kevin Wampler Well, I don't know how to speak to it from a drag or a benefit. I think obviously the cost that we're going to be spending that we're aware of are in our forecast as always along with the associated synergies that we're expecting this year. So that's no different than any other time. From an overall standpoint, we said $300 million to achieve a little bit more frontend loaded. And again that was true if you remember right we re-bannered basically 300 stores, 300 Family Dollar stores, we re-bannered 200 Dollar deal store to Dollar Tree. So there was a lot of CapEx costs associated with that in the first year and half basically, so that was a big part of it. As I said before, when we started this process, we said that the $300 million our best guess was OpEx half CapEx. And as Ive said as we went through this, its probably been little bit more CapEx at the end of the day and little less OpEx. But again, still have been our targeted range of what we would expected from the beginning from an achievement standpoint as well as a cost to achieve. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi You said earlier in the call that you feel like youve gotten the basically the format for Family Dollar in place now that you kind of use going forward. Can you just give us a sense for do you think that in terms of the pricing versus competition, you feel like youve kind of have the majority behind you and that youre in good shape going forward there; of course, tweaks and what not, but maybe just around pricing? And then also just in terms of the buying synergies, any sense for between the two banners, how much overlap there is in there and how much maybe more is to be realized? Gary Philbin Let me comment on the pricing, I think they were in retail were going to pay attention just about a weekly basis. And so clearly, while were pleased with what the format does because I think it makes some logical adjacencies for our customers to shop Family Dollar in a more productive and easier way for the customer that shows value. When it comes to pricing, we still are going to highlight the smart way to save, which our customer responds to across all the elements that weve been talking about. Weve got to show everyday prices on the shelf. We got have price drop, sale items that resonate with them on the things they buy most often. Compare and save. But were excited about this private brand redo and make it because we have a pretty good private brand program, but the values that we can show our customer and now were freshening up the label as we think will go a long way. But the pricing piece will continue to be something we watch now and going through, its just the nature of the beast as we make sure that we have the right retails on shelf and gives us flexibility with the smart ways to save whether electronic with smart coupons are on the shelf. Synergy, I would tell you that merchants work together on a couple of different elements. One we basically think about it in two ways, one its our domestic supplier. So what we have maybe about 10% overlap of between skews, its bigger than that when we consider some of the similar items we buy; so aluminum foil might be that poster child, were most likely five square feet at Dollar Tree bigger size for Family Dollar. But I would tell you on the import side, there is also an opportunity that we want to cycle through those buying trips four times a year. So we get four chances to get our integration going and have the merchants talk about whats going to be bought for the following years. So keep in mind as youre taking a look at some of the import side, the lead time is longer whats to show up in the synergy takes that amount of time for us to review our assortment to buy it, ship it, take it through the holidays then we revamp and redo for the following season. Well have more of it. There is certainly more opportunities for us to continue above and beyond what we had targeted to drive synergies. And I would say as much as anything reviewing assortments and driving excitement inside the assortment. Vincent Sinisi And maybe just as a fast follow-up, just now with the Family Dollar format kind of fully in place. Any qualitative or quantitative way we should think about footage growth annually by banner more of the split in there kind of post this year? Thanks very much. Gary Philbin We havent really spoken to that, I would just tell you maybe what excites us from a customer perspective is the way they shop the store across the categories that weve invest in. I mentioned immediate consumption. Our front-end thats more productive the fact that you can party and toys and gift cards are now in similar adjacencies that a mom who comes in the store can buy new born infant, toddler apparel next the diapers. So just some maybe retail one-o-one items that I think just drives better business and make it easier for our customer to shop. Operator And our next question comes from Joseph Feldman with Telsey Group. Joseph Feldman So wanted to go back also on Family Dollar business. Are you -- can you help us understand when we should start to see the operating margin improvement, I guess, accelerate? I think certainly there are some out there, including myself, that would have thought that wed be seeing a little bit better margin improvement, not necessarily gross, but just overall operating margin improvement at the Family Dollar business at this point. And I just wanted to get your sense of timing on that? Bob Sasser I think a couple of combinations. I think youve heard us talk about the foundation of things that were putting in; we said were in this for the long run. And weve done the things that we think as on the right path for running better stores, better assortments, better value on shelf; I think what were describing, what the renovation program now and something and thats maybe a little more visible for our customer to see, which also is going to be one of the engines that helps us drive overall margin growth; so as we do our 250 renovations this year as the new stores come out with the new format. Now, our customers is going to see something in fiscal way in a store thats cleaner, fuller, fresher and thats really another piece to the puzzle here that weve been focused on to say lets change the complexion of the fleet of stores and thats what youre going to see in the back half of this year. And I am anxious to get those out of ground, because I think those are the elements that combined with all the things weve been talking about; table stakes, merchandising energy in store assortments. But we also have to touch the fiscal plan to these facilities to make sure our customer sees a nice new fresh store when theyre going to make a decision of where theyre going to shop. So its hand-in-hand, we got to do both. Youve heard us to talk and about really in the first portion at this point in the renovation new store program is really next piece to this. Joseph Feldman And then just as a follow-up. With regard to some of the clearance activity, I guess not clearance, but with the rebranding of the private label, I guess. Im curious how that will impact the clearance of the older inventory and how thats baked into your outlook? Bob Sasser I would say in most cases, were just flowing at the high of the whether its the candy or whether its the trash bags; most of these consumables, they turns pretty quickly. And while we may have some, its all baked into our forecast. Most of these are going to be flow throughs with the existing SKU on the shelf being replaced by a new package. Operator And our next question comes from Alvin Concepcion with Citi. Alvin Concepcion Last quarter, I think you mentioned, you hadnt seen much change in the past year and half in the competitive promotional environment. Did you see that stability continue to 1Q and further into the second quarter? Bob Sasser I think competitions always part of our life. I watch intensely as does field operators and our merchants and what the competitors are doing from a couple of points of view are they doing with merchandise mix and businesses that theyre driving, as well as price, the pricing statements that theyre making. So we continue to shop. We see a lot of -- there is a lot of new competition out there, or coming in, especially in the grocery business. Were not a grocery store but we still sell some food and sell beverage and snacks and those types of product. So were watching that intensely. But at the same time, we remain focused on our customer, what our customers needs are and how do we put together that value equation for our customers. Gary was taking a Family Dollar that all the different ways to save with our add prices and our every day prices and price drops, which are surprising price value to our customers. So were going to stay focused on that; were going to watch what the competition does; were going to shop the price on key items, name brand items as we always have diligently; its different by market; we pay attention across the country. And were doing to evolve our business based on what our customers need. This new renovation program is just rolling up in second quarter, and were really excited about it, because it does take a lot of the components that weve been talking about and testing in different stores and puts some together. So our new stores are starting to rollout with the new adjacencies with the new mix of products, with the new store designs, as well as going back and renovating. Right now, were seeing 250 stores obviously based on performance we got put on the accelerator that exceeds expectations we certainly would jump on all over it. And then the other thing is radically rollout the renovations. The things that we found that are really compelling to the customers to the new stores we still have the ability to roll pieces in parts out to the existing fleet where we know its going to be a home run. So competition is retail, retail is competition. I have great respect for all of them. Were going to keep watching them and were especially going to stay focused on the customer and how they respond to what we offer in our stores. Alvin Concepcion And just a quick follow-up on the comps. It sounds like youre seeing more normalized trends in the second quarter, enough to give you confidence in the annual number. Just wondering if you could give us some more color on what youre seeing in second quarter since they were many issues in 1Q you called out? Bob Sasser I wish I could tell you exactly, but it's early. Yes, we feel good about our guidance we have all that we know embedded into our guidance for second quarter. We have a lot of -- still that was just early on in the quarter; Mother's Day was good; this weekend is Memorial Day holiday; and were expecting good things from that; and of course graduations based in our Dollar Tree business, is a big idea; and the Father's day and beyond. At Family Dollar it's all those things plus a bigger seasonal summer offering, because at Family Dollar we sell fans. So when it gets hot, we can sell lots more fans and beach supplies and coolers and charcoal grills and all the things we're cooking out. This should be a big weekend for that, as well as the apparel business at Family Dollar. As the weather warms, as we get bright blue sunny skies were seeing the apparel business take off; so there is a lot of bright spot. And just to step back and I would tell you that the big issue once more in first quarter on sales at Family Dollar was the delay in the tax refund checks. They were late and the business was in February was stubborn and difficult. But when the checks it you could see it day-by-day and you could see improvement in the sales. And then we came in to March where we lost Easter at pretty good March and met our expectations. We had a good Easter, but we could not make up what we lost in February. And that's the story that you see. Our discretionary business is what suffered, our consumer -- the things that they needed even with a bad -- with getting the checks like what they brought what they needed. So our consumable business was slightly up over the quarter, but our discretionary businesses were all of the comp decrease was. So that really is the story, but what happened at Family Dollar is it was structural it was do with our new assortments, it was more to do with just way things spell on those tax check, especially for that low income customer which we have a lot of Family Dollar. These tax checks to those lowest income customers they wait for them they count on them, and that's when they buy things like clothing and that's when they buy the things that they'd like to have but just can't afford to have of the times of the year. Operator We have time for one more question. Our question is from Patrick McKeever with MKM Partners. Patrick McKeever I'll just ask a couple of big picture questions, first of all, on the border adjusted tax. Just wondering, I know it's very iffy as to what happens there, but if that something that you're thinking about and is there any kind of contingency planning that things around it if it were to come to be? And then second question is just Bob, I know the past few conference calls you've had somewhat cautious comments about the economic well being of the -- of your core customer. And I know that later tax refunds were a big issue in the first quarter. But just thinking about your core customer, do you still feeling little cautious, or do you feel like things are getting better there? Bob Sasser Well, to that first of all, the border adjustable tax is still out there, still being debated in Congress. And I was watch on last night, night before last, reruns on C-SPAN of the House Ways and Means Committee and as they were talking to some retailers about the border adjustable tax and trying to get more tax and frame their position on that. It is still up in the air, its not until we know what it is we really dont know how to organize around it. I think were doing exactly what we should be doing and paying attention to it and trying to understand it as well as whats going and talking to our congressmen, talking to our senators, working with RILA and the other groups that are out there supporting retail and putting our position forward. So thats what were doing, and were actively been doing that and well see how it goes. I dont want to sit here and prognosticate one way or other what Congress will do it. But I think at the end of the day hopefully they will get it right and well have good result to this. So they are on to initiatives going on right now what is this and what is that; there is too many what ifs and too many open questions to make anything meaningful right now. So I would do exactly what we need to be doing right now, Patrick. On the health of the consumer, we serve the lowest consumer up through middle income consumers. So we serve a broad swath of consumers out there and I believe what I said in the past that the consumer was under pressure and concerned. I still think thats the case, and I think some of the -- whether its the economic questions that are out there with healthcare and Healthcare Reform and tax reform, and all of the issues that were working with at Congress. I think all of those had uncertainty as long as there is uncertainty, then the American consumer is -- theyre focused on being the light bill; they are focused on paying the rent, house payment, care payment; all the things; employment, will have a job, do I have a job until you get confident in their position that they do have a job and they cant pay the bills; theres going to be continue to be uncertainty. At Dollar Tree and at Family Dollar, we card every day to be one of the answers to their issues as they strive to balance their budgets, as they try to take their paycheck and spread it across the month, for the week, whatever the pay cycle is. We want to be part of the solution to their issues. We want to help them balance their budget by the things they want at great prices, great values surprising value. And at Dollar Tree you can slur because everything is still a dollar. Yes you can afford it at Dollar Tree you can go in and have a great party birthday party for the kids and for the family buys your seasonal product and still pay only a dollar. Operator And that concludes todays question-and-answer session. Mr. Guiler, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Randy Guiler Great, thank you, Christina. Thank you for joining us for todays call and for your continued interest in Dollar Tree. Our next quarterly earnings conference call to discuss Q2 results is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, August 24, 2017. Thank you and have a good day. Operator This concludes todays call.

As a reminder, a replay will be available one hour after today's conference. Peter Nyquist will now open up the call. Peter Nyquist Thank you and welcome all to this second call for today. With me here today, I have our CEO, Börje Ekholm and our CFO, Carl Mellander. So during the call today, we will be making forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our current expectations and certain planning assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. The actual results may differ materially due to factors mentioned in today's press release and discussed in this conference call. We encourage you to read about these risks and uncertainties in our earnings report as well as in our annual report. With that said, I would like to start off this call by inviting Börje Ekholm to begin. Please Börje. Börje Ekholm Thank you Peter. Welcome everyone and thank you all for joining. So let me start with of the starting point. We see our company performance to be unsatisfactory, clearly highlighting the need for the new focus strategy we laid out a few weeks ago. The quarter was very challenging overall and very tough but it's also a mixed picture. We see networks delivering a solid result despite declining sales but we also see accelerated losses in our IT, cloud and media businesses and here we need to take additional actions. The strategy we launched, a more focused strategy with the objective to regain technology and market leadership resulting in an improved profitability. We see here that we basically need to focus our portfolio on areas where we can and must win. We will also intensify the focus on our cost structure in order to make us more efficient and lean. This will include simplifying the way we work internally as well as making portfolio choices. We also see that we need to selectively increase our investments in some of the core areas to make sure we have the competitive products we need to win in the market, again a few years out. And we expect our strategy and we still behind that. We should see significant improvements already during next year, but we also have this ambition to double our operating, call it underlying operating margin, beyond 2018. Looking at the first quarter, we see sales down about 16%, if we adjust for foreign exchange. We also have significant adjustments that we will go through in more detail of SEK13.4 billion during the quarter in line with the announcement we made in the end of March. It includes restructuring charges, asset write-downs as a consequence of the new strategy as well as provisions and adjustments relating to certain customer projects. Our cash flow was worse or slightly better than last year, but still negative SEK1.5 billion. And we also see that our cost and efficiency program is not yielding the necessary result, given the profitability outlook as well as our market outlook. If we look in the different segments, we see networks falling by 18%. It's due to lower mobile broadband investments, but it's also due to the reduced scope in the managed services contract in North America and lower IPR revenues. We also had a falling, as you all know, into Q4 of last year of some hardware deliveries, which also impacted Q1 sales volume. The operating margin was, however, 12% or we made little more than SEK4 billion in this area despite lower IPR revenues. We think that is a very solid performance. We also see that historically we have lost market share for the last several years and we have seen that kind of stabilize during the last few quarters, which is due to our Ericsson Radio System platform which clearly is a competitive platform in the market. IT and cloud is down 7%. That's really our services side there growing but what we see here is lower legacy product sales and we do not see our new products being able to offset that decline. So the decline in legacy products are happening quicker than we anticipated and have seen before. Our operating margin also here fell due to lower sales, of course, but also a falling service margin. Here, our performance is not satisfactory. We need to do a number of actions that we are undertaking those already as a consequence of the strategic announcement. It's really to accelerate product introductions to get our new product to catch on faster, streamline the service organization as well as tightening scope on contracts as much as we can. And we expect to see improvements here during 2018. For our media business, we also see here sales down more than 20%, partly explained by lower IPR revenues, but the big part here is actually the legacy product portfolio also falling faster than we have been able to grow our new products. And that has resulted in, as you can see, a big loss of over SEK1 billion, which is due to lower gross margin in sales. And this unit, we are basically looking at this from two product parts. One is the product and one is our broadcast services and we are exploring strategic opportunities for this business. With that, I am going to give the word over to Carl Mellander, our CFO. Carl Mellander Thank you Börje. So very important to consider when looking at this first quarter report, this difference between the underlying business which we just talked about here now and the one-off items, the extraordinary items and here I would like to go through a little bit more what those extraordinary items are. And as you see here, they fall into three categories. First of all, restructuring charges, of course, of SEK1.7 billion. This is business as usual. And you know we have indicated a total of between SEK6 billion and SEK8 billion for the full year, which also is in line with the amount we had in restructuring during 2016. The second category is write-downs. This is as a direct consequence of some of the strategic decisions that we have made and which we communicated at end of March. So here we are talking about some specific assets capitalized development and intangible assets that we have taken an impairment on following those strategic decisions around focused portfolio. The third category is around provisions and adjustments and for customer contracts and this can be broken down into several different components as well. First of all, we have, as you can see, a hit from net sales by SEK1.4 billion and this relates then to certain settlements with customers, but also revaluation of discounts in certain customer contracts where volume has decreased. And secondly, we have had to reassess the value of our trade receivables in connection with some customers on contracts and taken an impairment there or have set provision, I should say. And then finally then, part of SEK8.4 billion also provisions in connection with some specific projects. And those projects are mainly in the IT and cloud space. We have discussed them before also saying that those are complex undertakings. And then here we have seen during first quarter some negative development which has made it necessary for us to make provisions for cost where we don't see that we will be able to recover those cost with future revenues. So all-in-all, as SEK13.4 billion in the quarter in extraordinary items. And as you can see then, the underlying business, excluding all of those items and that on the gross margin of 30.5% and an operating income of SEK1.1 billion. Finally on this picture, we talk about tax impact and we are mainly talking about provisions here. So by definition it's an estimate of future impact, but we estimate the cash impact to be SEK5.8 billion and this will come over several years, depending on how specifics in those contract and projects develop. We move on to look at the geographical sales split and here we have used the new split of the company in terms of geography, the market area structure. So as you can see here, South East Asia, Oceania and India grew slightly by 1% and that growth really comes from South East Asia where the growth continues in mobile broadband investments, while India is showing challenged market with consolidations coming up, but also challenging pricing situation on the market for operators at the moment. North East Asia flat year-over-year. As you can see, Mainland China declined somewhat but we do see the growth now coming in Japan and Korea, offsetting China. In general, I would say China is a relatively stable market from what we see. North America also stable as a market. We see downturn in our own sales year-over-year. And this is mainly to do with the managed service contract which we have talked about repeatedly the last couple of quarters as well. Europe and Latin America, different story. Here sales is really down by 16% year-over-year. And of course, we do see slowdown in Latin America in general and not least in Mexico while Brazil is compensating somewhat for that. But overall, Latin America is down with the challenge macroeconomics. When it comes to Europe, the level is continuously low when it comes to CapEx investment by operators and this is also reflected in our downturn. Finally Middle East and Africa, challenged macroeconomics and this is the impacting us indirectly of course via the investment budgets of our customers. If we move on to look at gross margin and the delta here, what explains it year-over-year is really first of all the IPR licensing revenue piece and Börje mentioned it already that and as many of you will remember, Q1 2016 we had couple of one-off items in IPR licensing revenues and that these were not repeated now. So with a total volume in IPR of SEK2 billion on the topline that fell short compared with last year's quarter one by SEK1.8 billion and this, of course, has an impact on gross margin. Networks, fairly stable. If anything, a little bit positive while both IT and cloud and media then caused the gross margin overall to come down for the reasons explained here on the slide. And we can move to the next one. Looking at the gross margin on a sequential basis instead and we see that we actually improved gross margin from fourth quarter and the part which is positive here to start with is in the network segment side as well where the share of capacity business as well as the share of IPR business increased. And frankly, the absolute the mounds are down but of course, when we look at gross margin percentage this has a positives impact because the share was higher. IT and cloud, again reduced margins in those large transformation projects that we talk about and IT managed services as well while media in the comparison was flat sequentially. Operating income then, if we look at this bridge, again comparing with Q1. Last year, IPR took its toll on the operating income as well, of course, with shrinking volume and the gross margin decline that I just described and we also had negative impact on the operating income. Expenses, I will come back to in a second because that's contributed slightly then to the bottom line in this quarter. Cost savings, as Börje already said in his the intro here, we are not satisfied with our cost structure and we need to do more. That's quite clear. We have the ongoing program, which is not yielding the sufficient results if we look at the current market situation as well as our position of the company. So here we will focus more, do more on structural actions. And of course now that we have stopped the specific timing on the SEK53 billion in OpEx, it's very important to note this does not mean that we put less effort on cost reductions, because this is of course key to our competitiveness going forward and we aim to surpass this ambition over time while of course the cost level can temporarily increase as we invest in certain of the areas to regain leadership. Gross cash position then, you can see the operating cash flow in the breakdown there, of course also very impacted between net income and operating assets from the extraordinary items but it washes out on the total. And you can see restructuring cash out in the quarter was SEK1.6 billion. Investing, capital investments are coming down on CapEx now as we are closing or completing the ICT Center buildout. And then you see that the effect of the EUR1 billion raised through two Euro bonds is coming into the cash flow here as well and that's a SEK10.9 billion net effect that you can see. But overall, net cash decreased by SEK2.9 billion in the quarter. A few words on reporting then. We are going to change the external reporting latest Q1 2018 to reflect our internal organization. What we do now as a small first step is to rename the media segments to other. And we will also go from the 10 regions that we have reported on before to five market areas to reflect how we are now as going forward in Ericsson. We will of course provide you with the restated numbers as well in advance as well. Finally then, these are the planning assumptions that we have included in the report, some of which are repetitions from earlier but we want to put them here so you know how we see the outlook. And first of all, we expect then that the trends that we see currently in the industry but also in the business mix, in our case in mobile broadband we will prevail during the year. We stick to our previous estimate of minus 2% to minus 6% decline in the RAN equipment market in dollar terms. We reiterate the fact that the rescoped managed services contract will have an impact on sales. And then we have a new item which you will also find in the report and that's the fact that now with our strategy regarding managed services and NRO which includes certain streamlining and addressing low performing contract, we expect that the topline effect of that will be up to SEK10 billion by 2019. We repeat when it comes to the IPR business that the baseline on the contract portfolio as it stands is around SEK7 billion. And finally then that the restructuring charges for the year will be SEK6 billion to SEK8 billion, as I said before. This is what we see now based on the visibility we have today. So with that, thanks a lot and back to you, Börje. Börje Ekholm Thanks Carl. So just to wrap up before we get into Q&A. What we see now is, as we said, we had a tough quarter, a challenging quarter. We put though our new strategy in place which includes much more focus on areas where we can and must win. We are also allocating more resources to increase the pace of innovation and new business development. Our new strategy or focus strategy, the purpose of that is of course to reestablish and revitalize our technology and market leadership but it should lead also to restoring profitability. And we are big believers in first we have to stability then we need profitability and from there on we can grow. So our near-term priority is to restore profitability. We are going to take significant actions internally and we are doing that with simplifying our organizational structure under a new leadership team and we expect to see significant improvements in profitability already in 2018 from the actions we take now and they should start to come through during next year. We also see with our focus strategy we are on the path towards doubling the 2016 operating margin when we are beyond 2018. With that, I give the word over to Peter for any questions. Peter Nyquist Yes. Thank you Börje. So operator, we are now ready for the Q&A session. So please. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Peter Nyquist Hi Pierre. Pierre Ferragu Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Börje, I would like to come to the areas for which you are considering strategic options. So I had in mind that media of course and [indiscernible] as well maybe IT and routing. And so when we look at the new reporting structure that you have given over recent months, it looks like these areas, after they are losing all of this money, like SEK8 billion to SEK10 billion, in what area I have estimated. And so my question was, what do you really mean by strategic options? What are the options you have at hand? Of course, I can imagine unit you find a buyer but I would assume like a risk, if you don't find a buyer for some of these activities is real, so if you don't find a buyer, are these activities that you would shut down as well? Would you consider that option? What I am trying to see is whether over time, we should consider these activities are not going to be part of Ericsson anymore? Börje Ekholm I understand you want to backstop in reality. Pierre Ferragu Exactly. Börje Ekholm What we have said and that's what we are doing, we are focusing our efforts on three parts in the company which is networks, managed services and digital services. That's where we are going to focus our investments in order to make sure that we win those areas. That includes investing in our current product portfolio for 4G and LTE, of course in networks. It includes investing in our solutions for digital services. And it includes investing in automation and basically getting the benefits from more use of technology in our managed services. That's our core focus. Then we had said, we will explore strategic options for our IT cloud infrastructure hardware business, which is just a portion of what we do in there. Then we are looking at alternatives which basically have the purpose to make our solutions more attractive for our customers. At the end of the day, that's really what matters. We have also said, we are pursuing strategic opportunities for the media business, which of course includes all different options, partnerships, divestitures, et cetera. But the reality here is, we are focusing on making sure we maximize the value at the same time. We think we have great products going into the market within the media business and we already see traction on those. But we think, in order to gain the critical scale to actually succeed in a very fragmented and evolving media marketplace, we need to look at different opportunities to do so. And that's what we are doing right now. Pierre Ferragu Okay. That's very clear. Thank you. Peter Nyquist Okay. Pierre, thanks. Next question please. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder from Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Peter Nyquist Hello Ed. Edward Snyder Thank you very much. A couple of questions. You said you expect, well you had some write-offs in the IT group, some strategic realignments there that increased your cost. I am just curious, is that realization that the products won't make traction in the market, you just thought that you are in a technical difficulties, you basically said you weren't going to be able to get the cost structure there? I am just trying to get a feeling for what happened in the IT structure that caused such a big write-off? Börje Ekholm You want to take it? Carl Mellander When it comes to the write-offs and the provisions, if you talk about that, then really related to some specific customers commitment and contract that we have where we have had negative development in those contracts. And therefore estimating then the future business plans of those contracts, we see that we do have excess cost compared with what we will be able to invoice the customer and get paid for. So this is really the issued. Very complex project and we have now, given these recent negative events, taken new view on that to estimate the cost overruns and hence the provisions. Edward Snyder All right. I am just trying to get to, was the change in terms of the contract by the customer or of the contract or was it just realizing you weren't going to be able to deliver on what the original trends were at the cost that you originally thought you could? Carl Mellander I think when it comes to scoping, we have learnt a lot during the journey here and some of those projects I think we can say could have been scoped in a better way. I think what we are trying to say is really that these are very complex projects in multiyear implementation phase and the multiyear, when they are up and running at the customer premises or customer solutions more than premises. So when we have done the scoping, to some extent we could have done it better. And that's what we are working on improving for the future. It's not that we are not capable of delivering the solutions. We just think it's going to get slightly more expensive than we expected before on a couple of these projects. Edward Snyder So it's not like less than a change in the market or a eroding market profile and more just learning curve on how do these projects and how to scope them better? Carl Mellander That's correct. Peter Nyquist Okay Ed? Edward Snyder Yes, sir. Peter Nyquist You good with that? Carl Mellander I think he has one more question. Peter Nyquist You have one more question. Edward Snyder Yes. One more real quick. We are reliving, to some extent, the microcosm we went through that we went through from the 2G to 3G transition way back when you had a scope of the industry was too large to support the demand profile and we went through that big wave of consolidation. It sounds to be similar here in that 5G or even 4G is not keeping up demand wise with the base of suppliers that have here. To what extent do you see, I know there are trials going on 5G, any in change or any hope in terms of pickup of demand for the new systems that would probably be some of the pressure on your sales force or your sales line? Or are we looking at a longer slog before we can wither see a pickup in revenue or a decline in competitive base of suppliers until we get to some sort of rationalization in the market? Carl Mellander Well, that's a few billion dollar question you are asking there. The reality is, the way I at least look at it is, the LTE technology will live for a very long period of time and you can look at the demand for data to the handsets or to the terminal, its growing still is a very high rate. That will, for a long period of time, be provided by the LTE generation. So it's really important that we continue to invest in technology for 4G. Then I think the 5G is starting to take some definition and some shape and we are starting to see field trials. Big commercial deployments are still going to be a few years out. But I do think that we should think differently about market where 4G really was a human communication channel, 5G will be increasingly utilizing machines. So it's going to be a different market when that comes. And I think that's what we should prepare ourselves for. So reality is, we still see a pretty good 4G market that will then later be complemented by 5G. Edward Snyder Thank you. Peter Nyquist Okay. Thank you Ed. Next question please. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Gareth Jenkins from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Peter Nyquist Hi Gareth. Gareth Jenkins Yes. Thanks guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones, if I could. One, I wondered if you could just talk about what's changed in the market since the start of the year, if anything, versus expectations? I think you touched on pricing in India and M&A there and also obviously Mexico and Brazil. But I wonder if you could just what widen that out in terms of whether you have seen any other changes since the start of the year? And then secondly, I just wondered what systems you are now putting in place? And I am talking about process and internal systems to Ericsson to avoid some of the visibility issues that we have seen in the past? Is it more around price warrants or what kind of internal systems and prices and checks and balances have you installed? Thank you. Börje Ekholm If you look at the market, you know I think Carl outlined what we see. We don't see a whole lot more than that. I mean it is a very competitive environment and it's a tough market. We have said already in our strategic forecast which has not changed that the market this year would fall to 6% in USD terms for equipment. We still think that's a reasonable estimate. And then after this year it will start to level out. So nothing has changed in that. So I think that's kind of what we see. We wouldn't say anything else. We are so geographically diverse, so we will always have some regions which are weaker or stronger than others. And of course it is challenging in parts of the world like Mexico and India, et cetera and those we are seeing as well. If we look at the way we run the pricing, it has a big element actually of price control in the way we run already. So that's not a big difference. Where we are changing, it's more on scoping of big transformation projects to implement and streamline our service delivery so we at least mitigate the risks in them as much as we can. Did I miss any question? You talked about a system to avoid previous situation that we have right there, Gareth? Gareth Jenkins Yes. Thanks. Börje Ekholm And that's what I saying that this is about on the project scoping that we are trying to get the processes in line in order to make sure we mitigate the risks of scope issues. So it's all about learning and process within the company. Gareth Jenkins Could you elaborate on that? Is that regular meetings between services and products? Is it having software systems in place to work through? Börje Ekholm This is why we actually changed the organization where we have moved product and services together now. And it was really in IT and cloud area. So we have merged our product organization with service delivery in order to get the tighter process to manage the scope better. Gareth Jenkins Okay. Thank you. Peter Nyquist Thanks Gareth. Next question please. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Peter Nyquist Hi Tim. Tim Long Hi. How are you doing? A few part here just talking about getting the longer term margin outlook. Just give us a little color on how you think the gross margin and the OpEx split will look in getting to those numbers? And then just curious about the revenue backdrop also to get to that? It sounds like you are assuming some stabilization in 2018 and probably beyond. Could you talk a little bit about how you think the gap is filled before we get the real 5G build going? So what do you think it is following this year that will help the industry recover a little bit? Is it just pure capacity upgrades or maybe it is early 5G that would be helpful? Thank you. Carl Mellander Carl here. I maybe at least the first part when you talk about the margin development going forward. I mean what we do say now is that the actions we are taking now, following the focus strategy will give clearly improved profitability by 2017. Sorry, by 2018. I am sorry. And that we will double then profitability going forward. So of course it's around continues improvements in networks. We talked about some of the factors here earlier including Ericsson Radio System, but also services streamlining. Of course, when it comes to IT and cloud, many actions to improve also the situation there in terms of scoping on new contracts and managing the existing complex contracts that we have. And exact numbers of gross margin, we are not really talking about in the report. But so I think I leave it at that. That's a clear improvement by 2018 through to the actions we are taking. When it comes to cost then, we have, as we said, stopped the specific guidance on the SEK53 billion in OpEx. And yes, we are aiming for better numbers but temporarily then, as we said, we might also increase the R&D piece of that numbers in order to invest in some of the areas where we need to regain the leadership. So that's I think as much as I can say. Peter Nyquist Great. Thanks Carl. Are you happy with that, Tim? Tim Long Yes. Just curious on the revenue side. What do you think for the industry will help things stabilize? Carl Mellander I think we haven't changed really our strategic forecast from November where we said 2018 total equipment purchases in U.S. dollars would stabilize. Nothing has changed in that outlook. Tim Long Okay. Thank you. Peter Nyquist Thanks Tim. Next question, operator. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Peter Nyquist Hi Simon. Simon Leopold Thank you for taking my question. Morning or afternoon. I wanted to see if you could elaborate a little bit on IT and cloud? Maybe some more specifics would be helpful? And what I am really trying to get at is how to think about the revenue and profitability trends for the balance of this year? And maybe part of it is that I am a bit lost by the pro forma or the gross income being significantly negative, even on somewhat similar revenue year-over-year, although down slightly. So I think on a little bit loss on the GAAP but ultimately I am trying to get at better understanding of the trends. Thank you. Carl Mellander Again, the trend for the rest of the year we are not really guiding on. But we say that especially in the IT and by 2018, we will see effects of the actions that we are taking now. So I think that's really and we have described what the actions are that we are taking as well. So the impact will be visible in 2018. Börje Ekholm And I think the challenge here is also that we see that we need to and that's what we said on the cost side, we are going to see some increased investments also to make sure that we accelerate our new products and bringing them to the market faster and that we will also probably have some cost for changing the structure in there. And that's what we see right now and we haven't really guided any more specifically than that. Simon Leopold Well, I guess what I am worried about is that if we make assumptions that are based on our prior models and sort of ignore this March quarter and maintain assumptions is a risk of disappointing investors in future quarters. If we make adjustments that are too extreme then it sort of throws the credibility of what the estimates are. So if there is anything incremental you can give us in terms of how to think about it differently versus what we may have been thinking last quarter? Börje Ekholm Let me describe what in reality has happened, which is that this legacy product portfolio in IT and cloud has fallen faster than any time before. So call it an accelerated reduction in there and we have not been able to compensate that with our new product portfolio. And at the same time, you see an increasing volume of services, which is due to large IT transformation projects and they are growing as a portion of the business area. In addition, those services have had a compressed margin in Q1, more so than before. And I think that's really what has happened and we have said that we will not guide on the detail quarters going forward. But there you have really the cause behind the deviation in Q1. Simon Leopold Okay. Thank you very much. Peter Nyquist Thanks Simon. Next question please. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Smith from Agency Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Douglas Smith Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to revisit this issue of the customer provisions and is it in your analysis that this sales incentives were inappropriate and they rewarded winning short-term contract but not long-term projects? Or is it in your analysis more than engineering issue about being able to deliver what the salesmen promised? Börje Ekholm I think it's fair to say that we do have a number of very large IT transformation or digital transformation projects at our customers. And here this is a new market. So it's an element of, call it, not knowing exactly what demands you would put on a new system. So we label it as where we have to improve the scoping. So it's more our own ability to scope these projects well enough when they are in areas that are not we nor anybody else have done before. And that's really why this is, call it, a step-by-step learning experience where we have taken of course, here you can accuse us of having taken some projects with now we have to provide against. But they are really done because we are entering a new area where it takes some time to build the experience base internally to scope them well enough. Sales incentive or anything like that, is rather when you enter uncharted territories, by definition you don't know all the facts. Douglas Smith So do you imagine this is an industrywide problem, just inability to scope correctly? Börje Ekholm I don't know. But I can only judge from ourselves. I think we have taken the steps now to learn from our past experiences in order to make sure that we are better at it going forward. Douglas Smith Okay. Thanks. A quick clarification, would I be reading it right when you say strategically you are looking for Ericsson to be somewhat a smaller company, but a much more profitable company. Is that a good way to put it? Börje Ekholm What we have said is that we will manage ourselves out of unprofitable projects or contracts within managed services and NRO. We have also said that we are pursuing strategic opportunities for some parts of the company. So your assumption, I think could basically be confirmed with that, right. Douglas Smith Okay. Thank you. Peter Nyquist Thanks Douglas. Next question please operator. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Terrence Anthony from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Terrence Anthony Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just had two quick questions. Do you think you can hold on to your investment grade rating given the cash outflow for the provisions to increased costs from your added investments, the restructuring which isn't paying off and the cash generation remains weak and on top of that you have got the DoJ investigation overhang? And the second question is again in terms of your contracts, do you anticipate any further provisions as some of your other customer try to renegotiate them? Börje Ekholm You want it? Shall I take it? When it comes to investment grade rating, of course it's important for us and the Board has also stated that earlier that investment grade rating is something as being important. Of course, we can't really speculate what the rating agencies will do but we are in close contact with them, of course, to deal with it. So let's see. For us, it's important to remain investment grade. When it comes to further provision, I would say, by definition what we have visibility on now is what we have taken action on in the quarter. So all the provisions we have done is based on our assessment of the current situation and this is all we have visibility on now. Of course, as in any project business, you don't know if this has inherent risks to it, of course this type of business. But we don't have any more visibility into that at the moment. Terrence Anthony Okay. Just one quick follow-up. Would you be willing to raise equity to defend investment grade rating? Börje Ekholm Now you are asking a very hypothetical question. I think the rating is of course important. We believe we have a plan in place that puts us in a solid financial position to deliver on that. That's really what we are focused on. Terrence Anthony Okay. Thank you. Börje Ekholm Thank you. Next question please. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Johannes Schaller from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead sir. Your line is now open. Johannes Schaller Yes. Thanks gentlemen for taking my questions. Two, if I could. Firstly on IT and cloud, I think it's clear that you have a lot of strategic options here, but if we assume you would not find a buyer or a strategic partner for that business, but you would have to keep operating that business as it is right now, can you outline little bit more what your strategy would be in that case? I think it would be very helpful for us to understand the plan here a bit better. And then secondly, Börje, I think when you came out with the new strategic plan, you said the R&D budget would be more or less the same going forward, but it would be allocated in a different way. You seem to be indicating an increase in R&D now over the next quarter. So maybe you could help us understand a bit better what has changed over the last weeks in your thinking about this? Thank you. ` Börje Ekholm If we start with the first question, we have laid out a strategy four weeks ago and we are focus on implementing that. That includes pursuing some strategic options or alternative for parts of the business. We haven't really focused on, assume for a moment we do not achieve that, what we are focused on is executing on it instead. And so were not, let me not go into any hypothetical questions basically. So here we don't have any reason to not believe we can deliver on the strategy. If we look at what we see and this may have been poorly expressed a few weeks ago but the reality is we saw already at that time more of a shift in the costs. So I don't think we are we would materially need to increase R&D. But we saw that we may need to shift into R&D. But where we see that we need to invest more right now, it's actually in the introduction of new products and to drive acceleration of our new product portfolio in IT and cloud. And that's really where we see the need for more investments. Johannes Schaller Understood. So maybe just a clarification on your, first on to IT and cloud. So should we take from that, that you are not really thinking too much about running this business on kind of Ericsson alone basis, but really strategic priorities would be for a partnership or some sort of other transaction? Börje Ekholm That's correct. Johannes Schaller Understood. Thank you. Börje Ekholm Next question please. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Achal Sultania from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Peter Nyquist Hi Achal. Achal Sultania Hi Peter. Good afternoon. So a couple of clarification questions from the morning's call. I think if I look at the U.S. trends, I think revenues were down 10%. Can you give us a sense of whether the RAN part of the business in the U.S. was actually flat? I am just trying to get a sense whether the trends in the U.S. are actually improving versus last year? Carl Mellander Yes. Hi Achal. Carl here. Yes, RAN market and sales flat. The main explanation for the 10% drop in sales in North America is really this managed services contract that we were talking about before. Achal Sultania Okay. And then just, you basically in one of your comments in the press release you talked about SEK10 billion headwind coming from low margin contracts that you have in managed services and network rollout. What should be assume for, as in this is from a base of 2016? Or this is from a base of 2017? This SEK10 billion impact? Carl Mellander Well, you should look at it, of course, from a 2016 number. And what we are saying here is that it's in order to give you some guidance on what the size of the business we are trying to change the terms of or possibly manage ourselves out of. And that's up to SEK10 billion. So it is to give you some sort of qualification to it. Achal Sultania Okay. But basically of that SEK10 billion, it's safe to assume that almost half of that would be this one large U.S. customer in that case? Carl Mellander No. That's already resolved, right. That already not part of it. It was not part of Q4 either. Achal Sultania Okay. No. I am sorry. I am still confused. Because I think the large U.S. customer you had, that contract expired I think in Q3 last year. So should we a 2016 base to measure this SEK10 billion headwind? Or should we use 2017 base? Carl Mellander Well, let's think about this, how to explain it. But of the contract volume, we had at the end of last year, we see that about SEK10 billion of them in NRO and managed services, we are in the process of renegotiating or changing the terms of. Is that clear? Achal Sultania Yes. Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. Peter Nyquist Thank you. Operator, we are now open for the last question please. Operator And the last question will come from the line of Richard Kramer from Arete Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Peter Nyquist Hi Richard. Richard Kramer Hi. Thanks. Two quick ones, just to sort of follow-up on some of the points that have been raised. I guess, Börje, for you the key question is, do you believe you have or are potentially continuingly losing business because of all the uncertainty and what's clearly extensive pending restructuring you have still to do in the business? And again in this sense, I am not sure if we should read this current announcement as an incremental or further need for restructuring? Or is this just sort of more urgency behind the plan that you laid out in late March? And Carl equally, can you tell us the SEK5.8 billion that you mentioned, is that the only cash component of restructuring we are likely to see over the next few years, because it seems that between the provisions and restructuring you have announced that we would have expected a good bit more? Thanks. Börje Ekholm Okay. If I start with mine, as a matter of fact we believe we have over the last five years actually experienced a loss of market share. What we are seeing now is we think that has flattened out during the last few quarters, partly due to the Ericsson Radio System, partly due to the other competitive product offerings we have. So we don't believe we have lost market share. But I think our numbers for the first quarter really shows the need to keep a very high pace at the restructuring we are doing and the bigger sense of urgency in the company. Carl Mellander Okay. So on the second question Richard, Carl here. The SEK5.8 billion refers to the SEK8.4 relating to the customer contracts. So to estimate the cash component but when it comes to normal restructuring charges, yes, of course it would be significantly higher and we estimate, as you saw that charge to the P&L fixed rate and the cash impact is rather similar to that. Richard Kramer And just to be clear, are you telling us that we shouldn't expect further, given the tone of this report and certainly Börje, the comments you made about IT and cloud in the first quarter and the legacy business there, isn't it prudent for all of us to expect further restructuring coming to resolve your dissatisfaction with the level of profitability over the course of the year beyond what you have announced in March? Börje Ekholm No. That's, in a way when we did the announcement in March on the fixed rate, you remember we raised the, what we think will be the normal restructuring at the time to SEK6 billion to SEK8 billion and that's in reflection of what we see we need to do on IT and cloud. That has not changed in the last three weeks. Richard Kramer Okay. Thanks. Peter Nyquist Thanks Richard. By that, we are closing the Q&A session and maybe Börje you want to have closing remarks. Börje Ekholm I want to say, it's been a tough quarter but I would also highlight that our network business, which is three quarters of our sales have been very stable, performed well and we have a clearly profitability issues in IT and cloud and media where we are taking actions in order to mitigate those and improve the profitability significantly for next year, but then establishing a new base beyond 2018. With that, thank you. Peter Nyquist Thank you Börje. And I thank you all for today. Carl Mellander Thank you. Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Our first question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Peter Nyquist Hi Pierre. Pierre Ferragu Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Börje, I would like to come to the areas for which you are considering strategic options. So I had in mind that media of course and [indiscernible] as well maybe IT and routing. And so when we look at the new reporting structure that you have given over recent months, it looks like these areas, after they are losing all of this money, like SEK8 billion to SEK10 billion, in what area I have estimated. And so my question was, what do you really mean by strategic options? What are the options you have at hand? Of course, I can imagine unit you find a buyer but I would assume like a risk, if you don't find a buyer for some of these activities is real, so if you don't find a buyer, are these activities that you would shut down as well? Would you consider that option? What I am trying to see is whether over time, we should consider these activities are not going to be part of Ericsson anymore? Börje Ekholm I understand you want to backstop in reality. Pierre Ferragu Exactly. Börje Ekholm What we have said and that's what we are doing, we are focusing our efforts on three parts in the company which is networks, managed services and digital services. That's where we are going to focus our investments in order to make sure that we win those areas. That includes investing in our current product portfolio for 4G and LTE, of course in networks. It includes investing in our solutions for digital services. And it includes investing in automation and basically getting the benefits from more use of technology in our managed services. That's our core focus. Then we had said, we will explore strategic options for our IT cloud infrastructure hardware business, which is just a portion of what we do in there. Then we are looking at alternatives which basically have the purpose to make our solutions more attractive for our customers. At the end of the day, that's really what matters. We have also said, we are pursuing strategic opportunities for the media business, which of course includes all different options, partnerships, divestitures, et cetera. But the reality here is, we are focusing on making sure we maximize the value at the same time. We think we have great products going into the market within the media business and we already see traction on those. But we think, in order to gain the critical scale to actually succeed in a very fragmented and evolving media marketplace, we need to look at different opportunities to do so. And that's what we are doing right now. Pierre Ferragu Okay. That's very clear. Thank you. Peter Nyquist Okay. Pierre, thanks. Next question please. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder from Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Peter Nyquist Hello Ed. Edward Snyder Thank you very much. A couple of questions. You said you expect, well you had some write-offs in the IT group, some strategic realignments there that increased your cost. I am just curious, is that realization that the products won't make traction in the market, you just thought that you are in a technical difficulties, you basically said you weren't going to be able to get the cost structure there? I am just trying to get a feeling for what happened in the IT structure that caused such a big write-off? Börje Ekholm You want to take it? Carl Mellander When it comes to the write-offs and the provisions, if you talk about that, then really related to some specific customers commitment and contract that we have where we have had negative development in those contracts. And therefore estimating then the future business plans of those contracts, we see that we do have excess cost compared with what we will be able to invoice the customer and get paid for. So this is really the issued. Very complex project and we have now, given these recent negative events, taken new view on that to estimate the cost overruns and hence the provisions. Edward Snyder All right. I am just trying to get to, was the change in terms of the contract by the customer or of the contract or was it just realizing you weren't going to be able to deliver on what the original trends were at the cost that you originally thought you could? Carl Mellander I think when it comes to scoping, we have learnt a lot during the journey here and some of those projects I think we can say could have been scoped in a better way. I think what we are trying to say is really that these are very complex projects in multiyear implementation phase and the multiyear, when they are up and running at the customer premises or customer solutions more than premises. So when we have done the scoping, to some extent we could have done it better. And that's what we are working on improving for the future. It's not that we are not capable of delivering the solutions. We just think it's going to get slightly more expensive than we expected before on a couple of these projects. Edward Snyder So it's not like less than a change in the market or a eroding market profile and more just learning curve on how do these projects and how to scope them better? Carl Mellander That's correct. Peter Nyquist Okay Ed? Edward Snyder Yes, sir. Peter Nyquist You good with that? Carl Mellander I think he has one more question. Peter Nyquist You have one more question. Edward Snyder Yes. One more real quick. We are reliving, to some extent, the microcosm we went through that we went through from the 2G to 3G transition way back when you had a scope of the industry was too large to support the demand profile and we went through that big wave of consolidation. It sounds to be similar here in that 5G or even 4G is not keeping up demand wise with the base of suppliers that have here. To what extent do you see, I know there are trials going on 5G, any in change or any hope in terms of pickup of demand for the new systems that would probably be some of the pressure on your sales force or your sales line? Or are we looking at a longer slog before we can wither see a pickup in revenue or a decline in competitive base of suppliers until we get to some sort of rationalization in the market? Carl Mellander Well, that's a few billion dollar question you are asking there. The reality is, the way I at least look at it is, the LTE technology will live for a very long period of time and you can look at the demand for data to the handsets or to the terminal, its growing still is a very high rate. That will, for a long period of time, be provided by the LTE generation. So it's really important that we continue to invest in technology for 4G. Then I think the 5G is starting to take some definition and some shape and we are starting to see field trials. Big commercial deployments are still going to be a few years out. But I do think that we should think differently about market where 4G really was a human communication channel, 5G will be increasingly utilizing machines. So it's going to be a different market when that comes. And I think that's what we should prepare ourselves for. So reality is, we still see a pretty good 4G market that will then later be complemented by 5G. Edward Snyder Thank you. Peter Nyquist Okay. Thank you Ed. Next question please. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Gareth Jenkins from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Peter Nyquist Hi Gareth. Gareth Jenkins Yes. Thanks guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones, if I could. One, I wondered if you could just talk about what's changed in the market since the start of the year, if anything, versus expectations? I think you touched on pricing in India and M&A there and also obviously Mexico and Brazil. But I wonder if you could just what widen that out in terms of whether you have seen any other changes since the start of the year? And then secondly, I just wondered what systems you are now putting in place? And I am talking about process and internal systems to Ericsson to avoid some of the visibility issues that we have seen in the past? Is it more around price warrants or what kind of internal systems and prices and checks and balances have you installed? Thank you. Börje Ekholm If you look at the market, you know I think Carl outlined what we see. We don't see a whole lot more than that. I mean it is a very competitive environment and it's a tough market. We have said already in our strategic forecast which has not changed that the market this year would fall to 6% in USD terms for equipment. We still think that's a reasonable estimate. And then after this year it will start to level out. So nothing has changed in that. So I think that's kind of what we see. We wouldn't say anything else. We are so geographically diverse, so we will always have some regions which are weaker or stronger than others. And of course it is challenging in parts of the world like Mexico and India, et cetera and those we are seeing as well. If we look at the way we run the pricing, it has a big element actually of price control in the way we run already. So that's not a big difference. Where we are changing, it's more on scoping of big transformation projects to implement and streamline our service delivery so we at least mitigate the risks in them as much as we can. Did I miss any question? You talked about a system to avoid previous situation that we have right there, Gareth? Gareth Jenkins Yes. Thanks. Börje Ekholm And that's what I saying that this is about on the project scoping that we are trying to get the processes in line in order to make sure we mitigate the risks of scope issues. So it's all about learning and process within the company. Gareth Jenkins Could you elaborate on that? Is that regular meetings between services and products? Is it having software systems in place to work through? Börje Ekholm This is why we actually changed the organization where we have moved product and services together now. And it was really in IT and cloud area. So we have merged our product organization with service delivery in order to get the tighter process to manage the scope better. Gareth Jenkins Okay. Thank you. Peter Nyquist Thanks Gareth. Next question please. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Peter Nyquist Hi Tim. Tim Long Hi. How are you doing? A few part here just talking about getting the longer term margin outlook. Just give us a little color on how you think the gross margin and the OpEx split will look in getting to those numbers? And then just curious about the revenue backdrop also to get to that? It sounds like you are assuming some stabilization in 2018 and probably beyond. Could you talk a little bit about how you think the gap is filled before we get the real 5G build going? So what do you think it is following this year that will help the industry recover a little bit? Is it just pure capacity upgrades or maybe it is early 5G that would be helpful? Thank you. Carl Mellander Carl here. I maybe at least the first part when you talk about the margin development going forward. I mean what we do say now is that the actions we are taking now, following the focus strategy will give clearly improved profitability by 2017. Sorry, by 2018. I am sorry. And that we will double then profitability going forward. So of course it's around continues improvements in networks. We talked about some of the factors here earlier including Ericsson Radio System, but also services streamlining. Of course, when it comes to IT and cloud, many actions to improve also the situation there in terms of scoping on new contracts and managing the existing complex contracts that we have. And exact numbers of gross margin, we are not really talking about in the report. But so I think I leave it at that. That's a clear improvement by 2018 through to the actions we are taking. When it comes to cost then, we have, as we said, stopped the specific guidance on the SEK53 billion in OpEx. And yes, we are aiming for better numbers but temporarily then, as we said, we might also increase the R&D piece of that numbers in order to invest in some of the areas where we need to regain the leadership. So that's I think as much as I can say. Peter Nyquist Great. Thanks Carl. Are you happy with that, Tim? Tim Long Yes. Just curious on the revenue side. What do you think for the industry will help things stabilize? Carl Mellander I think we haven't changed really our strategic forecast from November where we said 2018 total equipment purchases in U.S. dollars would stabilize. Nothing has changed in that outlook. Tim Long Okay. Thank you. Peter Nyquist Thanks Tim. Next question, operator. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Peter Nyquist Hi Simon. Simon Leopold Thank you for taking my question. Morning or afternoon. I wanted to see if you could elaborate a little bit on IT and cloud? Maybe some more specifics would be helpful? And what I am really trying to get at is how to think about the revenue and profitability trends for the balance of this year? And maybe part of it is that I am a bit lost by the pro forma or the gross income being significantly negative, even on somewhat similar revenue year-over-year, although down slightly. So I think on a little bit loss on the GAAP but ultimately I am trying to get at better understanding of the trends. Thank you. Carl Mellander Again, the trend for the rest of the year we are not really guiding on. But we say that especially in the IT and by 2018, we will see effects of the actions that we are taking now. So I think that's really and we have described what the actions are that we are taking as well. So the impact will be visible in 2018. Börje Ekholm And I think the challenge here is also that we see that we need to and that's what we said on the cost side, we are going to see some increased investments also to make sure that we accelerate our new products and bringing them to the market faster and that we will also probably have some cost for changing the structure in there. And that's what we see right now and we haven't really guided any more specifically than that. Simon Leopold Well, I guess what I am worried about is that if we make assumptions that are based on our prior models and sort of ignore this March quarter and maintain assumptions is a risk of disappointing investors in future quarters. If we make adjustments that are too extreme then it sort of throws the credibility of what the estimates are. So if there is anything incremental you can give us in terms of how to think about it differently versus what we may have been thinking last quarter? Börje Ekholm Let me describe what in reality has happened, which is that this legacy product portfolio in IT and cloud has fallen faster than any time before. So call it an accelerated reduction in there and we have not been able to compensate that with our new product portfolio. And at the same time, you see an increasing volume of services, which is due to large IT transformation projects and they are growing as a portion of the business area. In addition, those services have had a compressed margin in Q1, more so than before. And I think that's really what has happened and we have said that we will not guide on the detail quarters going forward. But there you have really the cause behind the deviation in Q1. Simon Leopold Okay. Thank you very much. Peter Nyquist Thanks Simon. Next question please. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Smith from Agency Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Douglas Smith Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to revisit this issue of the customer provisions and is it in your analysis that this sales incentives were inappropriate and they rewarded winning short-term contract but not long-term projects? Or is it in your analysis more than engineering issue about being able to deliver what the salesmen promised? Börje Ekholm I think it's fair to say that we do have a number of very large IT transformation or digital transformation projects at our customers. And here this is a new market. So it's an element of, call it, not knowing exactly what demands you would put on a new system. So we label it as where we have to improve the scoping. So it's more our own ability to scope these projects well enough when they are in areas that are not we nor anybody else have done before. And that's really why this is, call it, a step-by-step learning experience where we have taken of course, here you can accuse us of having taken some projects with now we have to provide against. But they are really done because we are entering a new area where it takes some time to build the experience base internally to scope them well enough. Sales incentive or anything like that, is rather when you enter uncharted territories, by definition you don't know all the facts. Douglas Smith So do you imagine this is an industrywide problem, just inability to scope correctly? Börje Ekholm I don't know. But I can only judge from ourselves. I think we have taken the steps now to learn from our past experiences in order to make sure that we are better at it going forward. Douglas Smith Okay. Thanks. A quick clarification, would I be reading it right when you say strategically you are looking for Ericsson to be somewhat a smaller company, but a much more profitable company. Is that a good way to put it? Börje Ekholm What we have said is that we will manage ourselves out of unprofitable projects or contracts within managed services and NRO. We have also said that we are pursuing strategic opportunities for some parts of the company. So your assumption, I think could basically be confirmed with that, right. Douglas Smith Okay. Thank you. Peter Nyquist Thanks Douglas. Next question please operator. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Terrence Anthony from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Terrence Anthony Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just had two quick questions. Do you think you can hold on to your investment grade rating given the cash outflow for the provisions to increased costs from your added investments, the restructuring which isn't paying off and the cash generation remains weak and on top of that you have got the DoJ investigation overhang? And the second question is again in terms of your contracts, do you anticipate any further provisions as some of your other customer try to renegotiate them? Börje Ekholm You want it? Shall I take it? When it comes to investment grade rating, of course it's important for us and the Board has also stated that earlier that investment grade rating is something as being important. Of course, we can't really speculate what the rating agencies will do but we are in close contact with them, of course, to deal with it. So let's see. For us, it's important to remain investment grade. When it comes to further provision, I would say, by definition what we have visibility on now is what we have taken action on in the quarter. So all the provisions we have done is based on our assessment of the current situation and this is all we have visibility on now. Of course, as in any project business, you don't know if this has inherent risks to it, of course this type of business. But we don't have any more visibility into that at the moment. Terrence Anthony Okay. Just one quick follow-up. Would you be willing to raise equity to defend investment grade rating? Börje Ekholm Now you are asking a very hypothetical question. I think the rating is of course important. We believe we have a plan in place that puts us in a solid financial position to deliver on that. That's really what we are focused on. Terrence Anthony Okay. Thank you. Börje Ekholm Thank you. Next question please. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Johannes Schaller from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead sir. Your line is now open. Johannes Schaller Yes. Thanks gentlemen for taking my questions. Two, if I could. Firstly on IT and cloud, I think it's clear that you have a lot of strategic options here, but if we assume you would not find a buyer or a strategic partner for that business, but you would have to keep operating that business as it is right now, can you outline little bit more what your strategy would be in that case? I think it would be very helpful for us to understand the plan here a bit better. And then secondly, Börje, I think when you came out with the new strategic plan, you said the R&D budget would be more or less the same going forward, but it would be allocated in a different way. You seem to be indicating an increase in R&D now over the next quarter. So maybe you could help us understand a bit better what has changed over the last weeks in your thinking about this? Thank you. ` Börje Ekholm If we start with the first question, we have laid out a strategy four weeks ago and we are focus on implementing that. That includes pursuing some strategic options or alternative for parts of the business. We haven't really focused on, assume for a moment we do not achieve that, what we are focused on is executing on it instead. And so were not, let me not go into any hypothetical questions basically. So here we don't have any reason to not believe we can deliver on the strategy. If we look at what we see and this may have been poorly expressed a few weeks ago but the reality is we saw already at that time more of a shift in the costs. So I don't think we are we would materially need to increase R&D. But we saw that we may need to shift into R&D. But where we see that we need to invest more right now, it's actually in the introduction of new products and to drive acceleration of our new product portfolio in IT and cloud. And that's really where we see the need for more investments. Johannes Schaller Understood. So maybe just a clarification on your, first on to IT and cloud. So should we take from that, that you are not really thinking too much about running this business on kind of Ericsson alone basis, but really strategic priorities would be for a partnership or some sort of other transaction? Börje Ekholm That's correct. Johannes Schaller Understood. Thank you. Börje Ekholm Next question please. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Achal Sultania from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Peter Nyquist Hi Achal. Achal Sultania Hi Peter. Good afternoon. So a couple of clarification questions from the morning's call. I think if I look at the U.S. trends, I think revenues were down 10%. Can you give us a sense of whether the RAN part of the business in the U.S. was actually flat? I am just trying to get a sense whether the trends in the U.S. are actually improving versus last year? Carl Mellander Yes. Hi Achal. Carl here. Yes, RAN market and sales flat. The main explanation for the 10% drop in sales in North America is really this managed services contract that we were talking about before. Achal Sultania Okay. And then just, you basically in one of your comments in the press release you talked about SEK10 billion headwind coming from low margin contracts that you have in managed services and network rollout. What should be assume for, as in this is from a base of 2016? Or this is from a base of 2017? This SEK10 billion impact? Carl Mellander Well, you should look at it, of course, from a 2016 number. And what we are saying here is that it's in order to give you some guidance on what the size of the business we are trying to change the terms of or possibly manage ourselves out of. And that's up to SEK10 billion. So it is to give you some sort of qualification to it. Achal Sultania Okay. But basically of that SEK10 billion, it's safe to assume that almost half of that would be this one large U.S. customer in that case? Carl Mellander No. That's already resolved, right. That already not part of it. It was not part of Q4 either. Achal Sultania Okay. No. I am sorry. I am still confused. Because I think the large U.S. customer you had, that contract expired I think in Q3 last year. So should we a 2016 base to measure this SEK10 billion headwind? Or should we use 2017 base? Carl Mellander Well, let's think about this, how to explain it. But of the contract volume, we had at the end of last year, we see that about SEK10 billion of them in NRO and managed services, we are in the process of renegotiating or changing the terms of. Is that clear? Achal Sultania Yes. Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. Peter Nyquist Thank you. Operator, we are now open for the last question please. Operator And the last question will come from the line of Richard Kramer from Arete Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Peter Nyquist Hi Richard. Richard Kramer Hi. Thanks. Two quick ones, just to sort of follow-up on some of the points that have been raised. I guess, Börje, for you the key question is, do you believe you have or are potentially continuingly losing business because of all the uncertainty and what's clearly extensive pending restructuring you have still to do in the business? And again in this sense, I am not sure if we should read this current announcement as an incremental or further need for restructuring? Or is this just sort of more urgency behind the plan that you laid out in late March? And Carl equally, can you tell us the SEK5.8 billion that you mentioned, is that the only cash component of restructuring we are likely to see over the next few years, because it seems that between the provisions and restructuring you have announced that we would have expected a good bit more? Thanks. Börje Ekholm Okay. If I start with mine, as a matter of fact we believe we have over the last five years actually experienced a loss of market share. What we are seeing now is we think that has flattened out during the last few quarters, partly due to the Ericsson Radio System, partly due to the other competitive product offerings we have. So we don't believe we have lost market share. But I think our numbers for the first quarter really shows the need to keep a very high pace at the restructuring we are doing and the bigger sense of urgency in the company. Carl Mellander Okay. So on the second question Richard, Carl here. The SEK5.8 billion refers to the SEK8.4 relating to the customer contracts. So to estimate the cash component but when it comes to normal restructuring charges, yes, of course it would be significantly higher and we estimate, as you saw that charge to the P&L fixed rate and the cash impact is rather similar to that. Richard Kramer And just to be clear, are you telling us that we shouldn't expect further, given the tone of this report and certainly Börje, the comments you made about IT and cloud in the first quarter and the legacy business there, isn't it prudent for all of us to expect further restructuring coming to resolve your dissatisfaction with the level of profitability over the course of the year beyond what you have announced in March? Börje Ekholm No. That's, in a way when we did the announcement in March on the fixed rate, you remember we raised the, what we think will be the normal restructuring at the time to SEK6 billion to SEK8 billion and that's in reflection of what we see we need to do on IT and cloud. That has not changed in the last three weeks. Richard Kramer Okay. Thanks. Peter Nyquist Thanks Richard. By that, we are closing the Q&A session and maybe Börje you want to have closing remarks. Börje Ekholm I want to say, it's been a tough quarter but I would also highlight that our network business, which is three quarters of our sales have been very stable, performed well and we have a clearly profitability issues in IT and cloud and media where we are taking actions in order to mitigate those and improve the profitability significantly for next year, but then establishing a new base beyond 2018. With that, thank you. Peter Nyquist Thank you Börje. And I thank you all for today. Carl Mellander Thank you. Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

(NYSE: T ) Cowen and Company 45th Annual Technology, Media & Telecom Conference May 31, 2017, 12:00 PM ET Executives Jeff Solomon - President, Cowen John Donovan - Chief Strategy Officer & Group President of Technology & Operations Analysts Colby Synesael - Cowen & Company Colby Synesael Good afternoon. My name is Colby Synesael and I am the communications, infrastructure and telecom services analyst here at Cowen. Welcome today to one of Cowen's CMT conference. What I am going to do now is I am going to introduce Jeff Solomon who is the President of Cowen. He is going to speak for a few minutes to you about our business and then we're going to do a follow-up with a fireside chat with John Donovan, who is the Chief Strategy Officer at AT&T. So, with that, let me introduce Jeff. Jeff Solomon Okay. Let's be really clear, you're not here to listen to me. So also, be clear that we're seeing you since the cost of lunches embedded in the five minutes you're going to give me while you're eating and finish up on your food because the next discussion is the one you actually want to hear. First of all, thank you all. I feel like we don't do that enough in our businesses to thank people. There is obviously a bunch of other places where you could be today and you choose to be here because you think there is going to be some value creation opportunities for you and so our responsibility in that regard is to make sure that we deliver on that promise and the fact that this is as well attended as it is and I'll tell you New York is probably the hardest venue where we do conferences because it's too easy for everybody to come for what they want and then run home, check the machines and then come back. So, when I see a room filled especially at lunch time, it suggests to me that the ecosystem that we're trying to create here, which is essentially its own TMT ecosystem where people can leverage off of each other's content is effective. So, I hope that you're taking the time today to be able to network and spend time with people can help you to move the needles beyond just the Cowan presentation. I want to thank our friends of AT&T for coming and spending some time with us today. As you know they probably get solicited by everybody that come to their conferences. So, it's a huge kudos for us and for Colby for them to be here today. So, thank you. Also thanks to the conference folks who do an amazing job, really putting this on. It's no [audio gap] percent dedicated in all aspects of their business to our performance. To the notions that alpha can still be created, it's a short list and what we're trying to get done at Cowen is to deliver on the promise that if you look at the world as those who care about active management, outperformance and those who don't, we're partners. So, if you're thinking about this as the old buy side, sales side paradigm, I'm asking you yet again to relieve yourself or disabuse yourself of that notion. We have a responsibility to each other to be moving the needle. If you're a company, it's all about being able to position you in your value creation proposition in the minds of capital providers and institutional investors who desperately need to pick winning stocks to outperform their cheaper brethren, right. I've asked the group of children when they came in for back-to-school day, how many of you go to school every day to be average? No hands cuff, I am like -- all right, so let me be really clear, if you bring home to see on your report card like what did your parents save you and they're like well it's got to be a bad day and I am like exactly except very investor in America is like hey, how do I just get the average? It's a real thing to think about. So, in our view this isn't just about positioning our brand in your mind. It's about delivering on the promise of that brand and so as we look forward to 2018 and the adoption of something called, listen to and from those of you who don't know what listen to is, you're going to hear all about it. Listen to is going to become the standard for the way that research is transmitted to the institutional equity community, has a profound impact on the dollars that Wall Street firms will spend on the delivery of research, which impacts everybody in the entire ecosystem of active management and it's coming to a theater near you in 2018 all right. As a result, very few firms are going to be investing in research because the research dollars spent will be less probably by the buy side than they were. Since our job is to make sure that we can continue to deliver high-quality research and continue to deliver high-quality trading and execution capability for our clients because at the end of the day, I actually don't care how you pay us as long as you do, if and only if we deliver. So, it's no longer just good enough to be good and it's no longer good enough to just be big or scaled; you have to be both and at Cowen we are. So tomorrow we close on our acquisition of Convergys, which for those of you that are portfolio managers after trading desk, we will be one of the primary liquidity providers for you to enter and exit stocks, fully independent, non-conflicted, agency execution globally, because our responsibility to you is not just in the ideas that we promulgate here, but how those ideas get into your portfolios with at least amount of friction and as least amount of cost as possible. So, as we continue to develop our business model here at Cowen, you're at the forefront of our minds, whether you're a company, management or you're providing the capital to those companies because the value we own to do what we do. And I just want to again thank you, take a few minutes to express our sincere gratitude for everybody who's making the effort to be here today. So, Colby, I'll turn it back over to you. Thanks everybody. Colby Synesael Thank you, Jeff. So, as I mentioned, we're here with John Donovan, who is the Chief Strategy officer of AT&T. John I believe you have a few quick remarks with regards to Reg F and then we can start. John Donovan You can sit for that. Colby Synesael All right. Thank you. John Donovan No, I wanted to recognize our attorney's great work and reference to safe harbor statements. We'll be making forward-looking statements. So, SEC filings are on the website if you have any questions, I'll direct you there. Colby Synesael Great. So, I think what's really cool about having you here up on stage with me is that there are so many different areas that we can talk about that arent just applicable to AT&T but really the broader TMT space. So hopefully we'll get to a bunch of them today, but what I wanted to do is wanted to start off with the wireless network and in wireless, we've entered an era of unlimited data and AT&T specifically is focused on building that with content including your DirecTV Now OTT video offers as a way to differentiate yourself in the market. Can help us get a sense what impact Unlimited has had on your network and some of the things that you've done to try and ensure that the quality of the network experience doesnt suffer. John Donovan Sure, our network has held up very well. The quality of our network -- wireless network has been great, but if you think about how we've deployed capacity, we have always tried to keep the invisible parts of the network, the ground-based network well ahead of the capacity and so for us, we always will deploy capacity a couple quarters in advance based on the trajectory of what we saw in the industry. And so, the factory size that we had was always based on what we forecasted the consumption to be and so it changes the game, but I think we're very well positioned both with the assets we have in spectrum and with the processes we have in place to deploy capacity and staff in front of it. So, it's not an overwhelming concern for us. We I think are well-prepared to continue down this path. Colby Synesael And now that you've won FirstNet, how quickly can we expect you to deploy the WCS and AWS-3 spectrum which you already had as well as the 700-megahertz spectrum you were receiving from FirstNet and more broadly how long do you expect your current spectrum holdings to be able to support the growth in traffic is the past that you're expecting? John Donovan Well spectrum is a very local business and that every market is slightly different and unique in its characteristics but if I were to generalize, I would say, roughly we have now with the winner FirstNet, we have 60 megahertz of deployable spectrum and their economies now that we are embarking on this unlimited phase in the industry that we're going to be out there touching an economy to go deploy all of that at once and that's the intention that we have. We'll deploy 700 that came from FirstNet, the WCS and the AWS spectrum in each of the markets we go in all at the same time. Colby Synesael And as it relates to the 60 megahertz that you have and that we're in an unlimited world now, is that going to be enough you believe to support us for the next several years in terms of what you're going to need to continue to offer unlimited products and continue to maintain the quality of the network? John Donovan Yes, and I think that when you look back at AWS-3 option and our strategy there and you look at FirstNet and our strategy there, we thought that it was vital that we have that runway that runs from today through 2020 where we had visibility, known spectrum, we had a deployment strategy that would allow for explosive growth. The acceleration of that with the unlimited programs that are out there now doesn't change the overall thesis. The video usage on the mobile network has been operating in a really rapid growth trajectory for quite some time now. So that was our strategy all along is to ensure that we had sufficient spectrum runway because the most effective way to deploy capacity is with spectrum. Colby Synesael And maybe just before we go a little bit further, can you just quickly describe to the audience what FirstNet is and what just happened there? John Donovan Well the government has been working for years and years to design a first responders network and with that, they had allocated spectrum 20 megahertz of spectrum in the 700 band and working through a design of what that network would look like and so the request for proposal that came from the FirstNet organization was really public-private partnership, but also a dedicated and commercial prioritization scheme that I think was an extremely clever way to approach the problem of getting interoperability for all the first responders nationally. And so, we were delighted to have been selected to partner with the government and we're now working through the process of putting together state plans and working our way towards getting the states in a position to evaluate the program. Colby Synesael So, I believe you'll be posting the plans in June. I think they got to the governors June 19, but any sense that John Donovan Give or take a day. Colby Synesael Give or take a day. Well that came from FirstNet you said that, but any sense at this juncture how many states you expect will participate or maybe asked differently why a state might elect not to sign up? John Donovan Well if you look at the needs of the first responder, we think that FirstNet did an excellent job of understanding what would be the criteria that a state would use to evaluate being in and so it's coverage, its reliability, it's -- not only in a normal state of affairs, but in an emergency how does capacity get consumed in the network? What features do you need to ensure that the first responders get the prioritization on the network? And so, I think once the states have an opportunity to evaluate in totality what it means to be in and what would be necessary to be out, I think it's a very compelling proposition for the states to join and we expected that most if not all will and we believe that we're going to have a very compelling case for. Colby Synesael And when will the build commence and I know you have five years to build out for FirstNet, but realistically what would you like to see happen? John Donovan It's a milestone based program and so we're going to move as fast as we can. We started earlier this year in viewing the planning for it so that when the award would be made, we would be ready to move extremely quickly and so a lot of the things that you need from a software perspective are already in the process of production. So, we think by the end of this year, we're going to have features for the states that will allow them to opt in even before the 700-megahertz spectrum is deployed. Theyll have an opportunity to get on our commercial network and have features like ruthless preemption, which is when all hackers breaking loose and there's a need for a first responder to get a channel on the network, theyll get that prioritization to get them that channel. And so as early as 2017, the minute they're ready, we're going to have some features that will provide them benefits immediate. Colby Synesael So, the network buildout for FirstNet could start as early as late this year as opposed to 2018. John Donovan That's correct. Colby Synesael And from a CapEx perspective your CFO, John Stephens has indicated that you guys could be at the higher end of your $22 billion range this year in part because of FirstNet. Do you think that we're going to remain in an elevated level through the next few years as we get this network filled out? John Donovan On a gross basis, yes there is going to be a buildout capital program will increase. On a net basis, the capital intensity won't rise because of the nature of the reimbursement that comes FirstNet for the $6.5 billion right and the upward bias for this year is really a deployment reimbursement timing kind of issue. Colby Synesael And just to sum up on FirstNet before we move on to another topic, how big of a deal then was FirstNet for AT&T? When you think of the other companies that may have been bidding for that as well, what position did this, what's the competitive position that this put you in? John Donovan Oh, my goodness, it's like the net -- the engineers are in charge again. When you think about how we've deploying, we've had a theoretical advantage with Spectrum and that theoretical advantage was converting now to a practical advantage with this deployment strategy. And so, what FirstNet has allowed us to do is unlock an opportunity for us to get a very economical way to deploy all of the spectrum that's out there and it also though has an opportunity for us to get our white space in coverage cared for and so our network is now going to be more comprehensive, faster and more reliable. So, for the engineer in me, the network side of things, it really is a great opportunity for us to take our wireless network to the next level. Colby Synesael So, to put words in your mouth, you have 40 megahertz of spectrum that was sitting by itself that you would have loved to deploy. You're now getting an additional 20, but there is a cost to deploying that first 40 megahertz. You now effectively have a partner who is going to financially enable you to do that all in one follow through, which is going to give you the capacity so that if we are competing in an unlimited world, you're going to be able to keep up with that perhaps more so than your competitors, correct? John Donovan Absolutely. Colby Synesael Now want to shift over to Millimeter Wave Spectrum. John Donovan Sure. Colby Synesael So, you recently bought Millimeter Wave Spectrum with your acquisition of FiberTower and recently lost out on a bidding war through Straight Path, do you consider Millimeter Wave Spectrum the next beachfront spectrum and in what function do you expect to utilize the Millimeter Wave Spectrum you received with FiberTower? John Donovan Several questions nested in there. Increasingly, spectrum is becoming real estate and it's harder to discern beachfront versus the stuff that you have here in the city that just faces the next building and that is because once you have your coverage layer set, the economics of your footprint get established. And so now you start to think about what's best for carrying video? What's best for the cheapest equipment the economics and so what's important about Millimeter Wave is it's the launch spectrum for 5G and 5G as a network is the most amazing technology that I've seen in like my whole career maybe IP is on par with it but a few other things and so it was important to us to get spectrum to launch 5G to be in the early 5G game and so that's what FiberTower afforded us the opportunity to get launch spectrum. Now we're going to want to augment that with some additional spectrum for capacity in Millimeter Wave over time, but there is a spectrum auction planned from the FCC that will be aftermarket opportunities we think as well. Colby Synesael So, you're going to be utilizing the millimeter wave spectrum for 5G intentions and I think -- and so two things, one is that you're not intending to use that for wireless back half which is how this type of spectrum is being used historically speaking. And then secondly, this is more around mobile solutions as opposed to fixed wireless, is that fair? John Donovan Well it's not entirely accurate in that there is something that's very different about 5G than the industry has ever done. Historically in the industry, we went into a standards process so that we could interoperate so that cell phones would hand calls from tower to tower that AT&T could hand off to Verizon and T-Mobile and Sprint and vice versa. And so those processes tended to take years as specifications got written. What's different in 5G is it's being written in two tranches. The first tranche, the first release is for fixed and it defines the radio access network so that that that innovation can happen and that's predominantly for fixed. And then the subsequent release of the standard will include mobility, handoffs, the interoperability sorts of things and so it's been broken into two releases and so the first release is one that everybody wants to be involved in because this technology is so transformative and so we're in that game and we've been -- we set up trials last year in Austin and we're in several other locations now. We started looking specific used cases, we're looking at DirecTV and a video delivery product. We're also doing some point-to-point for enterprises, we'll sort of think of it as a campus environment and those be important used cases early and we're learning. One of the things you trial is you trial for the technology and we're really happy with where we are. We're getting 14 gig at 3 milliseconds of latency. That's stunning. That's real time, that's faster than perception for you and so the technology is right on track. Then you look at and say what else do you learn in the trial. When you learn things like do I have to dispatch a technician, how big is the form factor, can I put it inside the building, does it have to be outside the building and those are the things that we're going to be learning throughout the remainder of this year and into next year, so we get our entire deployment strategy. And so, we want to be involved early and often as they say in all of the used cases that are going to be out there for 5G. Colby Synesael There is a good amount of people in the industry that remain skeptical about the use of millimeter wave. What do you think, that's being appreciated, or it's being discounted by those who might be feeling that while thinking about this maybe how we thought about 10 years ago? John Donovan Well it's a mesh technology and so I think a lot of folks think of Millimeter Wave for its short propagation characteristics, but as you start to think about how you would deploy it into buildings and so on, it's going to be deploying more like Swiss cheese and that's different than I think some of the historical ways that deployments have happened. But I'll remind you in that second release of 5G we're going to have it working on all the spectrum bands that are out there. So, it's going to affect the entire network ultimately. Colby Synesael You've now talked about something last night where 5G is going to be deployed differently than how we thought about 2G, 3G and 4G from the inside out. Maybe you could talk about how you guys are seeing that John Donovan Yeah and so that fits very well with the concept of this gig zones as you think about it and so you look at high consumption zones in the outdoors, that will be a really good used case for this, but then another one that's very good is where you would go point-to-point and then distribute it locally with Wi-Fi for instance. And so, the analogy I always use is that the industry grew up where we were lighting buildings from the parking lot. We were beaming signals eight miles to go make connections and so the smaller footprint isn't that troublesome because every day as the consumption and wireless network goes up and up and up and up, it makes more sense to do things from the inside out and so we like the building from the inside, not from the parking lot and so, the denser the network over time, the more practical that is. Colby Synesael There are three attributes that's being talked about 5G right now. One is enhanced mobile broadband effectively making things faster in terms of megabit per second. The second one is massive machine type communications or the enablement of IOT and then the last one is ultrareliable in the latency communications 10 milliseconds may be sub 5 milliseconds. Of those factors what do you think are going to be the most game changing and how does somebody like AT&T participate in that revenue opportunity? John Donovan Yeah so you missed two of them. There is two others that a not a lot of people are talking about. One is the software defined from the beginning, that a radically different thing and for AT&T as the leader in software defined networking, that's crucial. And then the last one is it's going to have in band telemetry. So, it's going to have tremendous bigdata capabilities for how we manage the network. So, if you go back to your three throughput and latency while, the most, the glamour shot is always what's the speed. I think the gamechanger in 5G is the latency because real-time networks change everything. So, let me just give you an example. If you're going to do an autonomous car, you're making a decision right now about how -- where am I going to control the car from? The tradeoff is do I want to do it from a live map and the map is the control. So, I want to do it from the network. Which things do I do from the network and so a simple example is if I go kick over one of those orange barrels that's out on the street and it's in the street, the first autonomous car that comes up there has a problem. And then now that problem has to be dealt with for the entire network so that routes change and so there is a central function and a local function. Now if you say the network is real time, then you can start to move those decisions out of the car and put them into the network. And so how maps get structured, how autonomous cars get control changes? Same with virtual reality. Virtual reality, if you have to rearrange all your furniture in your house and tether yourself to a machine, that evolution of moving from that to a power pack in your pocket, you get a 5G network, virtual reality can not only be outdoors. You can have very small form factors because you can do a lot of that computes in the network and so real-time here is about architectural shifts to everything we're touching. Colby Synesael And I think just use the car example, the benefits there would be rather than having a lot of sophisticated equipment in the car, which will be expensive per car, you could ultimately have that placed in the network once, which would be very cost saving I would think to those that are building out these solutions and then part of that would be that you're having some of that compute if you'll being done on the edge, which is part of I think the mobile edge compute of portion of 5G and some of that is actually still going to be done in the core. John Donovan Yes so, let me give you some perimeter math if you will in networking. If you think about our big data centers, think of give or take 40 datacenters and then you think about 4,600 central offices and then you think about 70,000 cell sites and then you think about 400,000 in network terminals; those are all positions, real estate positions with connectivity positioning that allows us to fundamentally rethink where we put things. So, the network itself moves from a connection to an experience that can include the compute for instance and so what we thought of as the network will evolve and so I realize I'm kind of on the back of 5G here. So, we're a few years out, but I think it fundamentally reshapes the configuration of networks and what we think of as a network. Colby Synesael Part of 5G is obviously small cells, how quickly does AT&T need to start building that out and where are you today in that development? John Donovan Yes, this year we'll deploy thousands and what we want to do is we want to gain the experience. There are certain spots in our network that are ideal for it. There are certain locations that we've tagged as ones that we think we need to be early in to gain right of way. So we're prudently saying what do we have to do this year and it numbers in the few thousand and then you look at that over time, when do you want to deploy? We even deployed as late as possible where you get favorable economics. Our strategy overall is to take advantage of the spectrum, take advantage of our tower density at 70,000, do small cells to supplement that and get our cost of small cell deployment as low as possible, do it as late as possible and then ramp to the speed that you need. Colby Synesael So, compared to others out there that might be talking more aggressive about rolling out small cells today, when you think of the opportunity tied to 5G, you still think of that as still several years out at least on the mobile side and from that perspective, you're willing to wait to build out in an aggressive manner thinking that over the next several years, the cost of building those small cells will come down. John Donovan Correct and I think that we have a fiber footprint and right-of-way access footprint that makes us not feel terribly nervous about that strategy. Colby Synesael I want you to talk about towers. John Donovan Sure. Colby Synesael So, at another conference recently when referring to macro towers, Bill Hogg said AT&T has found new suppliers with a new business model that is more sustainable and that AT&T is talking to existing suppliers to embrace this model. Can you explain what you want to see reworked with the current power operators that you're working with and perhaps shed some light on the magnitude of towers that you're looking to see these changes made at. John Donovan Well I think that the structure of the tower industry now if I could draw an analogy it's like we rent an apartment and then I have to -- I am charged every time I've take an appliance into the apartment and plug it in, that's not really tied to the economics of the industry that we're in. And so, what we're really after is more of the model that's square footage, square inch based, more of a real estate model as opposed to a technology or a touch model and so as Bill pointed out rightly, the model that exists today isn't sustainable for the industry and so we are looking at alternative suppliers as we build going forward. We're going to do a lot of our own building where it's economical and then we're just looking to bend that curve Colby Synesael And in terms of when you say building on your own, are you willing to get back into the tower business yourself or are you speaking more from the perspective you want to use new third parties to help build those towers for you? John Donovan Either one. A lot of the tower company's purchases in the first place were to buy towers that we had built. One of our core competencies as a company is building networks. We've got a 142 years of experience doing that and so we're good builders and we're going to go build and so we don't want to say we're going to do all of anything because there are situations where we go to third parties for a build. There are some where we will attach to existing towers, where we think they have the right economics and there is some where we will go ourselves. Colby Synesael You're good at sales leaseback with Crown Castle a few years ago and if I remember correctly, that's with a 2% escalator and effectively if it touches on the tower, I think you have two cell sites. So effectively no amendment is required, so the amendment of revenue. Is that a good model for what you're trying to get to? John Donovan And when we did that, we contemplated these touches and so that was a structure that I think works for us. Colby Synesael Based on the requirements for FirstNet, it sounds like you'll have to start rolling out as early as late this year and considering your One Touch approach, a lot of these decisions are going to have to be figured out shortly. With that said, is there enough time for you to be in a strong position to negotiate with the towers to get what you want and still meet the requirements that you need to for FirstNet? John Donovan Yes, we're confident, we can pull that off. Colby Synesael And then the last question on this is, based on the conversations you're having with your current tower partners, how well do you think it is that they're going to meet the demand or you're going to be able to come to an agreement with them around the terms that you're looking for them to change? John Donovan We've been in discussions with the major tower companies for months now and we're optimistic. Colby Synesael I want to shift over to SDN and NFV, AT&T has been a leader in SDN and NFV and today I believe about 34% of your network functions are virtualized and you're on pace for 55% by year-end. How responsible are these initiatives for the improvements we've seen in wireline margins of late and how much more savings can we expect to see from these initiatives? John Donovan Well I think John Stephens is the last several -- on the last several earnings calls about the trajectory and so we're very confident that we have a sustainable program here. Software defined networking is the hardest part of your program is on anything that you do technologically is the 5% to 30% because that's where you've got to get your economics worked out, that's where you've got to get your processes worked out and that's what's going to drive your efficiency. And so, for us in software defined networking last year was that year. We went from 6% to 34% and so this year getting 34% -- going from 34% to 55%, which we're on track to do seems like a formidable task as put out. I was telling my team; this year is easier than last year. So, I think we've hit the tipping point is what I'm saying. By the end of this year, we're going to be doing more things in software than we are the old way and so there's really no return. So, our operational processes move from blended to transformed and that's really a big part of this is capital is far more efficient and we've been getting the last five years on a -- when you look at our cost per gig carried, we've actually beat Moore's law. And the only way to beat Moore's law is to get out of silica and get into software and so you when we look back over the last 30 years, for 25 of those 30 years, we didn't keep pace with compute, or software development, or storage, or Moore's law. So, networking was the laggard here and so the last five years at AT&T, the software-defined networking has been transformative in not only the economics that you point out, but it has us in this curve of speed that we're just faster at deploying capacity. We're faster at how we manage the business and when you're faster, you're more efficient, time is silent. Colby Synesael What's been the response from the OEMs that you're working with and those that have historically been implanted in that network? Are they following in mind with where you need them to go? John Donovan I think that the traumas is over. I think that the spectrum was everything from sheer delight to sheer terror, but I think it's no longer this mythical spooky thing in the resistance of can it work? Those sorts of things are behind us and in order to do that we had to develop a lot of what were OEM products ourselves and it wasn't because we wanted to go back to the Western electric days. It was because we wanted -- we had to show them it could be done and then go back into those same supply chain folks and have them build from that. So, we've done a lot of work self-perform in software the last five years and we've pushed most of it into open source as you've seen. We've put one of the biggest projects ever landed in open source. We put out a few months ago in the Linux Foundation, which is basically the network operating system. We wrote an operating system for all of networking and then gave it away. And so, for my own team internally, imagine there's a few crazy moments where I'm with my own team. One of them is I said if people are going to believe us, I am going to start putting your compensation metrics out in public. So, there arent many people who like when we say we're going from 34 to 55, we're calling our shots January, February or March, we're calling our shots on all the major stuff so that the whole industry can look at it, so OEMs can look at it. And then the other thing is the day I told them we have to innovate faster than others can copy because in order for this to work, we're going to have to give a bunch of our work away and that's what we've been doing. Colby Synesael On the product side, you've developed a net bound product now more recently FlexWare leveraging the FDN and NFV platform. First of all, can you talk to us about what FlexWare is and that's the newer of the two. And then secondly, where are some of the other initiatives we can see coming out of AT&T because of this move to the software defined network? John Donovan Well FlexWare is if you think of it it's an app store for enterprises that does networking and that's the only app you have. So, you have a white box piece of hardware and you need a firewall and you can drag-and-drop a firewall. You need a voice over IP service you can drag-and-drop one. You need a WAN accelerating you can drag-and-drop one and so it literally takes on premise networking for enterprises and makes it like an app store, except what used to be major appliances that got racked and stacked are now just software and that's what FlexWare is. FlexWare is not only networking, it's the ancillary functions that a network needs beyond a carrier environment on a simple to consume software model. Colby Synesael And then I just want to shift over and talk about project AirGig and we have about three minutes left, so project AirGig, you're calling it one of the most ambitious and inventive projects in AT&T lab's history, which is obviously a very bold statement considering labs has invented. Help us understand what project AirGig is exactly and how game changing this could? John Donovan Well project AirGig is it's a wireless signal that propagates alongside or on a power cable, not through and that's the thing not a lot of people understand is that we are using plastic components that are super inexpensive and launching a signal that goes a very long distance, very reliably, at a very high speed along or adjacent to a power line. And so, for us it's a game changer on a cost basis because the components are small, sample and plastic performance wise. It's got extraordinary capabilities and so we're going to be in trials this year. So, it's a real thing. We're going to have to work through -- we know the technology works, but we need to understand is how does it work in the field, what's our design criteria for things like how long -- how far down a wire can we reliably propagate, but that would basically say broadband infrastructure is deployable at affordable rates everywhere there is aboveground power, which is pretty profound. Colby Synesael So where would you deploy this technology and how pervasive do you think it ultimately could be then? John Donovan Mexico, rural areas, it could be used for front hall, backhaul, for 5G. It can be used as a point to point. So, it has a lot of used cases. We're going to look in trials here. We're going to go into rural areas because one of the earliest used cases we would like to see it applied into is a replacement for some of the legacy broadband we have that's ADSL that's really expensive to go upgrade. Colby Synesael Just then a last question and really for the entire conversation, does this work with fiber or does this replace fiber in some situations? John Donovan It would augment a fiber deployment and what it would be, would be unique. If it's not, you need fiber in this. So, the way we think about it is we need to evolve our entire network to a gig. So, we're looking at G.fast for apartments. We're looking at 5G fixed as we talked about earlier. We're looking at fiber to the home. We're looking at AirGig. So, we're taking our entire footprint and we're trying to maximize the solution set we have, so we can serve every customer the most economical way possible with a gig and low latency and that's the objective we have. It's going to take years to get there, but we're going to press every one of those dimensions because there's no one access technology that we think is going to carry the day and win be ubiquitous. Colby Synesael With that, we're out of time. So, thank you very much for being here. We appreciate it. John Donovan Thank you, Colby.

Thanks, Chris. Our fourth quarter of FY 2017 was an excellent finish to a record-breaking year for Electronic Arts. Revenue, gross margin, earnings and cash flow were all above our guidance for the fiscal year, driven by strong and continuing player engagement across our portfolio of top-quality titles for console, mobile and PC. EA's games today are live services  amazing experiences that we update and evolve to deliver ongoing fun that keeps players engaged, connects them to their friends, brings them more content and grows our network. This strategy has been at the core of our digital transformation, and today our live services are some of the strongest and most vibrant in the industry. Battlefield 1 continued its outstanding start, with more than 19 million players joining the game through the end of FY 2017, a 50% increase over Battlefield 4 in the same period from launch. Our community of Battlefield fans is growing as new players join loyal franchise fans, driving engagement and player satisfaction levels to be among the highest in our portfolio. Our in-game Battlefield network now helps players move seamlessly from game to game in the franchise, finding their friends and connecting with the content to maximize the experience every time they play. FIFA 17 expanded the reach of the world's biggest sports gaming franchise, with more than 21 million players jumping in to the game through the end of FY 2017. Our creative teams, with the benefit of data and analytics from our network, delivered The Journey  our new story mode in FIFA 17 that has engaged more than 12 million players to date. With story mode having brought in many new players, we also saw more of our players go deeper. Our FIFA Ultimate Team player base grew 13% year-over-year through the end of Q4. Ultimate Team is also the gateway to our esports competitions for both Madden NFL and FIFA. Within the broader Ultimate Team communities, more than 10 million players participated in competitive matches in the first year of our tournaments, and our global spectator audience continues to grow. On mobile, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes continues to tap into the passionate Star Wars fan base, maintaining one of the most engaged player communities across our entire network. With a constant cadence of in-game events and new content drops, including new Rogue One characters, the average time played per day increased to a record 162 minutes in Q4, and player satisfaction levels are reaching new heights. Across our top mobile titles, we are driving thousands of live events per quarter, deepening the experiences and connecting players through guilds, challenges and content to fuel their passions. Our Sims franchise continues to expand one of the broadest and most demographically diverse player bases in our portfolio. The Sims 4, now two-and-a-half year since launch, saw monthly active players increase 33% year-over-year in Q4. With a total of seven downloadable content packs delivered throughout the year, as well as game updates that offered more choice and fan-requested features, The Sims 4 community is thriving. Games as a service are reshaping our industry, and EA is positioned to lead. Our investment in EA digital platform that connects players across games, franchise and devices, also provides more data from our games than ever before. With the data and capabilities of our platform, we're able to do things differently, move faster, and innovate for our player communities. Amazingly creative games combined with services like Ultimate Team, our Battlefield network, multi-platform experiences and subscription programs like EA Access are the future of this industry. With every player that joins our games, every game session, and every engagement in our live services, we are adding strength to EA's Player Network. In FY 2018, we'll deliver more thrilling experiences that broaden the reach of our major franchises and drive deeper engagement through more ways to play. Our EA SPORTS portfolio continues to have the biggest player community in sports games, and this year we'll add new experiences to grow that audience. Madden NFL 18 is set to be the most innovative Madden title in more than a decade, using the full Frostbite stack to deliver new modes that bring the sport to life in unprecedented ways. FIFA 18 will expand on The Journey and Ultimate Team, and we'll connect to more soccer fans with FIFA as our first title on Nintendo Switch. With new NHL, NBA LIVE and UFC console games, as well as more live events and content for our growing EA SPORTS player base on mobile, our multi-platform EA SPORTS portfolio is set to reach more fans around the world in FY 2018. We're also incredibly excited to bring Star Wars Battlefront II to the massive Star Wars community later this year. This game is made possible by the collaboration of three incredibly talented studios  DICE, Motive and Criterion  bringing together their individual strengths and building on the feedback from our passionate fans. Star Wars Battlefront II will have more than three times the content of the previous game at launch, with a brand new story, a new single-player campaign, new modes, characters, vehicles and planets from all eras in the Star Wars universe, as well as a live service plan that will continue to add even more fun for the global community. Our Star Wars Battlefront II debut trailer has generated more than 16 million views across YouTube and other social platforms, and we'll have much more to share about this game in the weeks and months to come. This will be a year of pioneering and creativity across many of EA's top franchises. Every Battlefield 1 player will have more ways to play throughout the year, with continual game updates, new maps, and three more expansion packs adding new armies, regions and battlegrounds available to the whole community. We're just getting started with our live service plans for this massive game, and later this year, we'll introduce new ways for players to get an even bigger Battlefield 1 experience. Two of our other genre-leading franchises will also see new titles this year. The industry's biggest multi-platform racing franchise, Need for Speed, returns to console and PC with a brand-new title that will give racers vast customization and more freedom to race wherever they want. And on mobile, our Sims franchise has been a genre leader since launch, and this year we're going to deliver a brand new, deeply social experience for this wide-reaching global community. Competitive gaming and esports will be a key growth factor for us throughout FY 2018 as we expand the ways that fans can play and watch. Year two of our FIFA and Madden NFL championships will kick off this fall, featuring millions of competitive games through Ultimate Team, deeper partnerships with leagues and teams that add new dimensions to the tournaments, and new venues for our major global championships. Later this year, we'll launch our first Battlefield 1 competition, unlocking the competitive spirit that runs deep in our Battlefield community. We're also continuing to expand our broadcast reach and content portfolio for our growing spectator audience. There is global excitement for our competitions, and this year we'll broadcast our tournaments and add additional programming through more major network partnerships including ESPN, BT Sport, Univision and more. Looking forward, we will continue our aggressive pace of innovation through experiences that capitalize on our technology, network and creativity. We are very pleased with the progress of our new action IP from BioWare. The design is stunning, gameplay mechanics are excellent, and the action will be exhilarating. This game is built around a live service, and through our creative process, we've decided to add more to the disruptive new social designs for our players. To accommodate that, we are moving the launch date for this project into Fiscal Year 2019. Through FY 2019 and beyond, our portfolio will continue to grow. There'll be more new experiences for our Battlefield fans. Our Star Wars action-adventure IP from Visceral will make its debut, and farther out, we'll have a new Star Wars title from our partners at Respawn. We continue to invest deeply in new IP, including the new game from BioWare and another project from our Motive Studio. With Frostbite powering more of our EA SPORTS games, we'll continue to break barriers and lead sports across all platforms. And on mobile, we have titles from more of our major IP in development. Electronic Arts is leading the industry with some of the most creative, sophisticated and engaging entertainment available anywhere in the world. Yet we are building towards a far more powerful and connected future. As engagement and consumption patterns across platforms and business models continue to evolve, we are investing in our network to keep players connected to each other and the games they love. Our focus on esports continue to draw more players and spectators to the excitement of competition in our games. Our subscription services like EA Access are providing more fun and tremendous value. And with the unification of our engine and our platform, as well as major advancements in deep learning, AI and social layers, we are unlocking new ways to connect players and personalize their experiences at scale. This is the future of play that we see at Electronic Arts, and that we are ready to lead. Now I'll hand the call over to Blake. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. Thanks, Andrew. I'll start by reporting our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net sales to discuss the dynamics of our business. At the beginning of fiscal 2017, at our Investor Day, we outlined to you the long-term trajectory of our business. We said we would invest in our player network, advance our live services, grow our digital revenue and deliver a more profitable and stable business than ever before. I'm delighted to say we're delivering on all of those commitments, and we are making the right investments to continue along this trajectory. Net revenue for the year was $4.8 billion, cost of revenue $1.3 billion, and operating income of $1.2 billion. Most importantly, these results enabled us to deliver record operating cash flow of almost $1.4 billion. We also returned over half a billion dollars to shareholders through our repurchase program in fiscal 2017. Total net sales for the year were $4.9 billion, a record. Digital net sales accounted for 61% of this, up 6 percentage points year on year. Extra content was a record $1.3 billion, with Ultimate Team contributing $832 million. Moving on to the details of our fourth quarter: GAAP net revenue was $1.5 billion, compared to $1.3 billion a year ago. Cost of revenue was $202 million, down from $226 million last year, a significant improvement on our guidance of $242 million. Operating expenses were $608 million, $17 million above our expectation, driven by an advance write-off of a licensing agreement. This resulted in an earnings per share of $1.81. As Chris mentioned, to compare this year's results to historically-reported non-GAAP measures, please see the new tabs in the downloadable model. Net cash provided by operating activities was $407 million. Operating cash flow for the full fiscal year was $1.38 billion, the highest in company history and 13% greater than last year's. Fiscal year 2017 capital expenditures were $123 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.26 billion. Please see our earnings slides for further cash flow information. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $4.53 billion, with 37% of this balance held onshore. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares at a cost of $125 million. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the $1 billion, two-year buyback program we began in May 2015 with an additional $30.8 million of repurchases. Average cost per share over the two years of the program was $72.66. Looking forward, we announced today a new $1.2 billion, two-year stock repurchase program. Now, turning to net sales to discuss our business drivers for the quarter: Net sales were $1.09 billion, above our guidance of $1.075 billion, and 18% higher than last year. This excludes $53 million of net sales related to premium editions of Mass Effect Andromeda that we had originally expected to be captured in Q4. They will now be captured in Q1. Digital delivered $885 million of the $1.09 billion in net sales, up from $712 million last year. This growth is driven by the ongoing digital transition, as more players choose digital purchases over physical, as well as by our ongoing success with event-driven live services such as FIFA Ultimate Team. Diving into digital net sales: Extra content and PC free-to-play contributed $405 million, up 31% over the prior year. The key element remains Ultimate Team, which grew 23% year-on-year, or 29% at constant currency. Expansion Packs for The Sims 4 also made a strong contribution. Our ability to engage players through live services and events continue to drive strong growth and deliver dependable on-going sales. Our mobile business delivered $175 million in net sales, flat year on year. Key mobile games driving the sales in the quarter were Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, FIFA Online 3 Mobile, NBA LIVE Mobile and FIFA Mobile. The growth in these games was offset by a slowdown in some of our legacy titles. We're doubling down on live services and events across the mobile portfolio, and the strategy is paying off. For example, FIFA Mobile just had its best-ever month since launch in October. Full-game downloads added $192 million in net sales for the quarter, up 43% year on year. For fiscal 2017, for the current generation of consoles, full-game downloads accounted for 33% of unit sales to consumers, considerably ahead of the 29% we had forecast and 9 percentage points up year on year. The chief driver was the continuing evolution of consumer behavior, but some of the outperformance was driven by the shift from Star Wars Battlefront to Battlefield 1, as well as the digital performance of our catalog. As a result, we continue to believe the underlying trend is closer to 5 percentage points per year. Finally, subscription, advertising and other digital net sales totaled $113 million, up 19% over the same period last year. EA Access and Origin Access continue to grow strongly. In conclusion for Q4, we were able to exceed our expectations for revenue, earnings and cash flow, demonstrating the power of multiple live services revenue streams. Now, turning to our expectations for fiscal 2018: we expect sales of current generation consoles to continue to be strong, with the installed base growing to 105 million consoles by the end of calendar 2017, up from 79 million the prior year. We expect PC gaming to decline slightly, and the mobile market to grow in the high teens in calendar 2017. Guidance for fiscal 2018 is for GAAP net revenue of $5.1 billion, cost of revenue of $1.3 billion (18:24-18:55) in our statement of cash flow. They do not impact our total cash and cash flow, but they do increase our operating cash flow and decrease our cash flow from financing activities. For fiscal 2017, applying the new rules would increase reported operating cash flow by $195 million and decrease financing cash flow by the same amount. A table presenting the impact is included in our earnings release. For fiscal 2018, applying the new rules, we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $1.6 billion. We anticipate capital expenditures to be around $120 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.5 billion. Turning to business drivers, we anticipate net sales for the year to be $5.1 billion, up 3% year on year. This is driven by growth in Ultimate Team, mobile and Star Wars Battlefront II. It is offset by the success of Battlefield 1 last year and by FX. The stronger dollar represents a headwind of around $110 million to fiscal year end net sales. Our currency assumptions are disclosed in our earnings presentation on our website. Segmenting the sales provides further insight into key drivers of our full-year net sales guidance: Net sales of packaged goods and other is forecasted to be approximately $1.7 billion, down 10% year on year, driven by the shift to digital. Digital net sales are expected to contribute $3.4 billion, up 11% year on year. Breaking down digital sales further: Our mobile business is expected to grow between 5% and 10%, led by the new Sims experience and continued growth from FIFA Mobile, NBA LIVE Mobile and Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. Net sales from full-game downloads are expected to grow 10% to 15%, driven by the underlying change in consumer behavior, offset by the fact that Star Wars Battlefront may skew slightly less digital (21:00-21:31) services are in a given franchise. In fiscal 2018, we expect to see net sales of live services to grow between 10% to 15%, led by Ultimate Team and Battlefield 1. As Andrew mentioned, we have made the decision to move our new BioWare action title out of fiscal 2018 and into fiscal 2019. We're very excited about this opportunity for a new franchise and we want to further develop the live service component. Focusing on Q1: we're expecting GAAP net revenue of $1.425 billion, GAAP cost of revenue of $157 million and GAAP EPS of $1.93. We expect Q1 net sales to be $750 million, up 10% year on year, driven by Mass Effect Andromeda, Battlefield 1 and Ultimate Team. At the beginning of our year, at our Investor Day, we shared our long-term vision for the company. It provided context and framework for a very specific set of near-term goals we gave you in our annual guidance. Our fiscal 2017 performance demonstrated how our vision generates excellent financial results and supports growing our cash return to investors. But we are only just beginning to leverage the potential of our player network and event-driven live services. As we continue to do so, we will build a deeper player base and engagement, grow digital revenue and deliver a more profitable and stable business. Now, I'll turn the call back to Andrew. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. Thanks, Blake. We are at a powerful point in EA's journey. The investments we've made in our IP, our technology platform, and our live service strategy uniquely position EA to lead in a networked world that spans more players, platforms, and geographies than ever before. At our core, we are a creative company. We are game makers that love to capture the imagination and make extraordinary entertainment possible for our players. We're also unique in that we have a unified, world-class technology platform and engine that provide the backbone of our network. Our studio teams are leveraging more sophisticated data and insights, secure and scalable infrastructure, and new game (23:41-24:10) and streaming in the future. With every experience, we are working to bring our players even closer. Constant community input is part of our creative process today: from developer feedback sessions and continual dialogue with community influencers, to the gameplay data that helps us tune and optimize, to community test environments where we can share our latest innovations. Putting our games into the hands of our players  like we will at EA PLAY in Hollywood in June  helps to keep us moving, evolving, and constantly pushing for more breakthroughs. We're continually engaging, expanding and strengthening our network by keeping players at the center of everything we do at Electronic Arts. As we deliver more groundbreaking experiences, and deepen the engagement of our global player base, the EA Player Network is how we create greater value through a connected world of play. Every day, the global community of gaming is expanding  through more devices, more games, and more ways to play. Our EA Player Network will enable players to navigate, to find their friends and engage in more of the experiences that matter to them most. Through persistent experiences and user interfaces like our Battlefield network, to playing and viewing esports competitions, to discovery of new content that adds to the fun, the EA Player Network is already helping to deliver a more personal and connected gaming world for our players, and we're just getting started. We're looking forward to another year of growth and leadership for Electronic Arts. Now Blake and I are here for your questions. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Operator, if we could open for questions now, please. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Certainly. We'll pause for just a brief moment while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question is from the line of Justin Post of Bank of America. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Blake, in your guidance you talk about gross margins, looks like being up. Can you talk about the Star Wars impact there? And then maybe also how the other digital content is kind of helping the margins in the year. So kind of frame those two inputs this year into the gross margin outlook. Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. Yeah. Sure, Justin. Before I do that I wanted to make just a quick announcement about our IR team. Carolyn, who almost all of you, I think, have met or know, has been with us for three years and is moving to our corporate FP&A team, which is a great move for her, and we thank Carolyn for an amazing three years of support to all of the investors and sell-side analysts. We have a new person joining the team, Erin. You'll get a chance to meet her in the coming months and we look forward to having her on our team. But thanks to Carolyn. So to your question, Justin, first, if you look back to the difference between the year before the first Star Wars, fiscal 2015 and then fiscal 2016, you saw a fairly muted growth in gross margin, up about 50 basis points roughly. We expect a similar effect this year because of the impact of the royalty on a very large title as we saw last time. And the comparison was, remember this year a pretty tough comp because our gross margin was actually higher than we had originally anticipated because we sold more Battlefield than we anticipated and less Titanfall than we anticipated. Titanfall obviously has a royalty to Respawn and we expected that, but we got a little bit more bump in gross margin We will see gross improvement as we continue to grow the live service part of our business, Ultimate Team and other similar live services on top of existing games. But for now we're only expecting a little less than 100 basis points or around 50 basis points because of that, primarily of that impact on Star Wars Battlefront II. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Next question, operator. Operator Our next question is from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Blake, can you just talk a little bit about your view on esports and kind of your esports strategy? There's some people regarding going  and how do you think about monetizing esports the next couple of years? And then secondly, can you just talk a little bit about your expectations and guidance for FIFA Ultimate Team off of the pretty tough comps and the great performance from last year? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. Sure. I'll let Andrew address the broader esports strategy. I think the thing to remember is it's built around Ultimate Team for our core sports games and we'll most likely build it around in a similar style live service for non-sports games in the future. But I'll let Andrew talk little bit about that. I'll come back on the Ultimate Team question. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. Yeah. We're very excited about our esports strategy and what we're doing, and what we saw this year in both FIFA and Madden were significantly higher engagement and monetization inside of Ultimate Team for those competing in esports tournaments. And again, this isn't just about the big championship tournaments. We run a whole series of events at a grassroots level all the way up to the elite level of tournaments. And so we think about this in a similar way that we think about all sports, which is we want to make stars of all of our players, the novice player as well as the professional player. And while there will almost certainly be solid revenue generation from broadcast rights, from sponsorship, from advertising, from players and teams and the monetization of those things, the lion share of the revenue will always be the digital transactions that exist in the ecosystem. We see that in leading esports tournaments and leading esports games already. And what we have seen in FIFA Ultimate Team and Madden Ultimate Team over the past 12 months confirms what our original strategy was, which was we will drive those other things. We will benefit from those other things. The lion share of return will come from the ongoing engagement and live service component that is things like Ultimate Team. And you should expect as we launch other esports games that they will also revolve around a very robust and rich digital ecosystem similar to Ultimate Team. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. And in terms of guidance relative to Ultimate Team, the thing to remember that was  two major drivers in FIFA this year were, first, the addition of a story mode in the game. The Journey brought new people into the game and brought those people from the game into Ultimate Team. So it grew the overall base of people playing in Ultimate Team. The second is the addition of the competitive gaming mode inside of FIFA which, as Andrew mentioned, drove massive engagement around tournaments and around practicing for tournaments. Both of those styles of change we're going to try to adapt into Madden in one way or another, and you'll see more of that coming in the coming months. But you can assume we've learned a lot of great lessons from FIFA. We'll try to drive Madden Ultimate Team and Madden Competitive Gaming off of similar modes. But FIFA doesn't sit still. It continues to find new ways to engage people in new modes and new excitement, and as Andrew said, we'll be evolving The Journey in FIFA, which will continue to bring new people into the game, we believe. That's the core. Now our guidance doesn't anticipate anywhere near the level of growth that we actually achieved this year. We tend to do that each year with FIFA because while it's very predictable based around events, we've continued to surprise ourselves on the upside. So you should trust that it's a rational number in terms of our guidance, but there is growth in there. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Next question? Operator Our next question is from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC So, Andrew, I think the decision to add The Journey to FIFA was based on user feedback, and that seems to be yielding dividends. So what kind of user feedback have you gathered from the first iteration of Battlefront that you will be looking to add to Battlefront II. And, Blake, will you give us a sense of what percent of your mobile bookings are growing with the new games? And what percent of your bookings are from the legacy games that are now in decline? So wondering when we'll mathematically see a change in the growth trajectory as the mix changes. Thanks Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. Yeah. So, thank you. As you know, Battlefront I was a great game, and widely regarded as the best way to fulfill your Star Wars fantasies. Frostbite really brought the Star Wars universe to life, but there were some things that a number of players asked for. A single player campaign was probably the number one thing that players asked for, and you heard that we'll be doing that. And I'm very excited by what we're seeing there. The Motive Studios who is a collection of developers who have a tremendous track record in building action-adventure and single player campaigns is putting that together. They wanted things like space battles and more vehicles and more heroes and more eras and more planets, and what you heard from us is that it will have all of those things. We took the feedback very, very seriously. We've invested in a very meaningful way, and when we say we believe the game is three times the size in terms of content, we're very serious about that. And our expectation is that the large, engaged passionate fan base of Star Wars fans around the world are going to love everything that we're doing. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. In terms of mobile, our net sales for the year were up 10% year-on-year. We're not happy with that. We think we can continue to grow that more, but I remind people that we didn't bring out NBA mobile and FIFA mobile until the back half of the year in October, essentially, and we've continued to learn and tune those games around the world. So we should continue to see more growth out of those. We've had some amazing performers like the Simpsons: Tapped Out or Real Racing or Sims FreePlay that are in year four or year five of their lives and the fact that they're still going is pretty impressive relative to many mobile games. But we will see a natural decline in some of those as we add less content and move to players to new, more exciting games or new versions of those games. And so, I don't know when you're going to see a more dramatic growth level. We've guided to around 5% to 10% of growth for the year, but we certainly are focused on trying to drive the new Sims title, as Andrew mentioned, as well as the sports titles because we feel that those are fabulous formula that we've been able to develop and leverage, both on the console and PC world as well as now in the mobile world. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Next question. Operator Our next question is from the line of Tim O'shea with Jefferies. Timothy Larkin O'shea - Jefferies LLC Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a few more on Star Wars Battlefront II. So the first installment sold around 13 million units in its launch window. Obviously, a very number. Is this the right framework to use as we think about how to model Battlefront II? And then, there's been a bit of confusion on how you intend to support the game post-launch and I just was hoping you might clarify what we should expect in terms of season pass or DLC. And then, just broadly speaking at a higher level, how is the anticipation for that game shaping up? What's the feedback you're seeing around the announcement of the single-player campaign and the trailer? Thank you. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. So again, in terms of, we'll start from the back. The fan anticipation has been very, very strong; 16 million organic views. That's not us paying the viewers. That is fans seeking out the content. I would say the feedback has been almost entirely positive. The inclusion of a single-player campaign, the inclusion of a new heroine in Iden, space battles, new content, new heroes, new world, new planets. I think the feedback of that is very, very strong. As we think about the live services, nothing  I'm not talking in great deal about it now other than, the game is going to be three times the size of the original game at launch and we also have a very, very robust live services plan that we're going to talk about in the coming weeks and months, particularly around EA PLAY and E3 in just a few weeks' time. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. Yes. And I think on the unit forecast, we sold 14 million units of Battlefront I in the year it was shipped and built into our guidance as essentially the same number. Our aspirations are clearly to sell more. We think this will appeal to not just the broad Star Wars fan base, but also to the deep, heavily-engaged Battlefield fan base and Battlefront fan base. And we see that as a critical part of the success of this game going forward and as Andrew mentioned, we've got the depth and the breadth in the games that will help that. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Next question? Operator Our next question's from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two on mobile. I wanted to know if we could tease-out a little bit about where you saw strength in mobile versus some of the legacy titles that might have been a drag on mobile just so we can tease-out some of the headwinds and tailwinds in the Mobile business. And then second, any sense of marketing and how it's being impacted in terms of trying to drive mobile engagement? Is there any change there, or you're actually leaning in against some of the key titles on the mobile engagement front? Thanks, guys. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. Yes. Thanks, Eric. The core product portfolio that's been there for four or five years like the Simpsons I mentioned, have actually shrunk. Games like Sims FreePlay have stayed fairly consistent but not grown dramatically. And then things like FIFA, NBA, and particularly Galaxy of Heroes have grown dramatically. And so, I think what you'll see as we layer in games like the new Sims game and the sports games continue to grow, you'll continue to see that hopefully offset any of the shrinkage in the older portfolio. Those numbers for the older portfolio are starting to get fairly small and stable, and so I don't think you'll see a lot of headwind from that. In terms of marketing. We're continuing a very ROI-driven marketing approach that's got a lot of discipline around it. We have a whole team led by our Chief Marketing Officer that focuses not just on our console and PC marketing, but very much on the mobile marketing. And they're driving decisions almost daily as to how to support the products. That's the beauty of the business is, when something's working well you can tune up the daily marketing. When it's not, you can tune it down. I would say, though, that we remain very focused on leveraging known IP that we own or license to try to offset some of the costs of marketing and has allowed us to run our mobile business at a level of profitability we believe higher than most, as well as, driven by the fact we're spending less on ROI-driven marketing. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Next question? Operator Our next question is from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So I wonder if you guys could comment on your experience with Battlefield 1 DLC. What the conversion rate was in the March quarter and what your expectations are for fiscal 2018? I believe you guys had four maps launching this fiscal period. And then second question is more a clarification. Your commentary on full-game downloads being 9% last year, but moving back to 5%, is that a number for the company or something you expect the industry to trend at? And if it's not for you, where would you expect it to be given the Star Wars versus Battlefield dynamic? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. Yeah. So thanks, Drew. The first question on Battlefield 1. We're not going to disclose attach rates because they're becoming less and less meaningful, particularly in a world of live services. And you'll see some changes to our approach, particularly with Battlefield and Battlefront over time that makes those DLC less important because it's ongoing content that's being delivered. I will say, you'll also see a lot of content delivered to the broad community for Battlefield, not just for the DLC owners going forward, which I think will continue to make those numbers a little less meaningful. We're very pleased with the engagement levels on Battlefield, as well as the ongoing sales of Battlefield 1, and we think that will continue on. And I guess what I would say is, based on having seen some of the DLCs, I would never refer to them as a map. We've got a lot of exciting stuff coming and a lot of interesting things about World War I that have yet to be even seen. In terms of full-game downloads. The number surprised us because we had thought that it'd be around the 5% year-over-year growth. Some of that may simply be the consumer is shifting faster than we know or we expected. The trends can sometimes jump in dramatic ways and maybe we're starting to see that overall shift. And some of it could be product-related. We do think the industry will end calendar year 2017 probably above 40%. We will most likely lag that as we have historically because FIFA is such a large product and it is so global that we are operating in markets where either the ability to purchase digitally, or the ability to download based on bandwidth speeds, are compromised and thus we tend to skew a little lower on FIFA than we do on the rest of our portfolio. So we've always lagged the industry slightly, but we are excited about the potential that you're seeing the consumer possibly shift quicker to digital than we'd originally anticipated. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Next question? Operator Our next question's from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Oppenheimer & Company. Andrew Uerkwitz - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker) Yeah. Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I've just got two quick ones. Around Battlefield 1, it seems like the excitement around the game is a little bit better than you expected. Has that changed your view on the intensity or the strategy around extra content for this fiscal year? And then, could we see more in the following fiscal year to support Battlefield 1? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. I would say it hasn't really changed our overall approach for this fiscal year. You may see some things you didn't actually anticipate as it evolves, but the general strategy is still based around quarterly or monthly DLCs that we put out. I do think you'll start to see that evolve next year as we get into more competitive gaming and it will clearly evolve, as Andrew mentioned, around Battlefront II property that we start to evolve the services associated with DLC to make them more live service, event-driven style gameplay versus purely an additional piece of content. Andrew Uerkwitz - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker) On that particular comment, if I may, are you kind of leaning towards kind of (44:10-44:18) Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. You cut out. Operator Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. Doris, why don't go onto the next question? We'll come back to Andrew. Operator Our next question is from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen & Co. Doug Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC Yes. Thanks. I think your revenue-deferred adjusted gross margin this quarter was a bit over 81%, which is I think more than 400 basis points higher than your previous high in any quarter you've reported. Obviously, you had a big digital mix this quarter. But there's been other quarters in the last couple of years where you've had similar digital mix, and the gross margins have been in the mid-70%. So wondered if you could talk about  was there anything special in this quarter that drove the gross margin so high? Mix of business, or anything like that? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. Yes. I think primarily the biggest driver I would say is the mix, lower royalty-bearing titles this year versus last year  Battlefield catalog, for example, versus Battlefront catalog last year. There was also  the one thing to remember is our technology team, led by Ken Moss, has done an amazing job making our back office ability to deliver digital much more efficient. We don't talk about it a lot, but it's become a continued help in our gross margin as we expand. And we'll continue to drive that. That's lower cost storage, lower cost delivery, more efficient network and platform that we've built it on. It's all pretty powerful, and that continues to help us as well. And then obviously continued digital, as we said, is also a major driver in the business which has helped us in the quarter. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. Doris, next question, please? Operator Our next question is from the line of San Phan with Mizuho. San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Hi. It's San. Two questions on my end. How far along are you in building and staffing out Motive Studio in Canada? And how should we think about that impact to the trajectory in R&D expenses over the next two years? And then secondly, can we just get your current thoughts on what areas are most interesting to you in the industry in regards to potential M&A? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. So I'm sorry, San. I didn't catch the first part of your first question. Can you repeat the question? San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Oh. Sure. It's just how far along are you in building out and staffing out the Motive Studio in Canada? And basically, what's the impact to the trajectory in R&D? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. Yeah. It's a good question. Thanks. We're well along the way. We've hired close to 100 people for that studio  some of the most fabulous talent I've met in many, many years. It's very exciting for us to assemble a brand new team. We're finalizing our new office space there, which will have both Motive people as well as the BioWare Montréal team in that same office. We still have some hiring to go, but I think for now it'll be at a more gradual pace over the next couple of years as we move probably from, say, 100 to 150 or so as we go forward, so. But it's been exciting to be able to build such a great new team. And in terms of the second piece on M&A, I think there are few large companies out there, and most of the companies are small. Many of the companies we've looked at we've passed on because the valuations have been so high, but we're continuing to keep our eyes and ears open, particularly for things that could add to either games that don't have live services and we can layer live services into them or games that could leverage our network and our scale that we don't have. And those will be big themes for us, but unfortunately, it's not a long list of companies that are out there of scale that we can go after. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Next question? Operator Our next question is the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hey. Good afternoon. Couple quick ones here. Despite moving out an entire title, guidance is quite solid on a tough comp, and then your digital guidance is up nicely, even with Star Wars, which last time was a bit of a drag on digital. So would you say that the biggest component of the favorable overall guide and digital guide is mostly the result of strength of Battlefield 1 live services? Or would you attribute it to something else? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. I would probably attribute it to live services in general, so not just Battlefield, but the overall portfolio, both mobile and non-mobile where we're trying to layer more live services and are seeing success. We're seeing obviously  we have expectations for growth across the sports portfolio, both in HD and in mobile. We do have a new UFC game, I think as everyone knows, next spring and we have the Need for Speed game coming in. So all of those add to the growth in the year, despite the fact that we have a tough comp to try to beat between Battlefield, Titanfall and the strength of FIFA this past year. So we see it as kind of growth across the whole portfolio versus dominated by one product or one new product. And we do have the new Sims game that Andrew mentioned that's coming out during the year on mobile. We don't know exactly what time of year that will come out, so we don't have a giant expectation in the guidance, but that's clearly in there as well. Operator Our next question's from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark. Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me as well. Curious if you could give us a deeper perspective, I guess on what's happening within BioWare. Mass Effect I think from a quality perspective didn't exactly hit the mark and it looks like we've now delayed the anticipated new IP which sometimes is also tied to quality. So curious if there's any change in leadership or developer turnover. What sort of cap internally within BioWare? And then second question's PopCap. It looks like you have some layoffs in that studio. Obviously, that studio has good IP, used to, as well as [talent]. I'm sort of curious how you see the future of PopCap. And also with tinkering with head count on the overall firm or any trends there we should think about through fiscal 2018. Thanks, guys. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. So let me just make sure that was only two questions and not three or four. The first one is what's going on with BioWare; and should we read anything in from Mass Effect to the new title? So that's that collection of questions. And the question was what's going on at PopCap and should we read anything in there? Was there a third question about head count overall? Or was that just head count related to PopCap? Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. We lost Mike now. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. Mike? Operator Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. Okay. Well, I'll answer... Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Only the first two. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. And we'll go from there. The first thing is, is Mass Effect is an interesting title. It was in development for a really long time and represented a lot of the great things that BioWare is known for: story, size, depth, breadth, imagination. And while overall, the aggregate review scores were lower than we would have liked, we did have over 100 reviewers score the game at 80 or higher. So it represents a fan base that's very passionate; looking for very particular things. And many players found exactly what they're looking for and some players did not. With that said, we believe Mass Effect Andromeda delivers a rich, deep experience which celebrates what makes the franchise great: wonderful, beautiful, deep rich worlds, amazing combat and engaging fast-paced, multiplayer. New multiplayer content is continuing to be released and new content kind of arriving overall more regularly so. We're very happy with kind of how BioWare is doing, how BioWare is treating Mass Effect. And our expectations for Mass Effect are still strong for the future and the franchise overall. In terms of the new IP, the choice to move the new IP and what happened with Mass Effect are completely unrelated. The realities is we have a creative process. As a company, creativity and pioneering is really important for us. Now, innovation in games is important more now than ever. And as a leader in the industry, we see it as our responsibility to innovate. And as part of our creative process  and I get to be involved in that creative process  we recognize that there was so much more opportunity in a connected network social world to do some things in the new BioWare game that had never done before and we don't think anyone is going to do anytime soon. But by virtue of our network, our cross-platform presence and our scale, we think we can do that. And we chose to give the team some more time to deliver against that innovation because we believe players are looking for the kinds of things that we plan to put into that game. And so we're very happy with BioWare. BioWare has continued to support Mass Effect, and the new team is doing some amazing things, and you'll hear more about that in the months to come. In terms of PopCap, again, I think there's a couple of different presence for PopCap. We have an amazing PopCap team in Vancouver that built Garden Warfare 1 and 2 on consol. That game continues to do extremely well, high critical acclaim, strong engagement, and strong sales over its life, so we're very happy with that team. The team's building against Mobile Games out of Seattle, recognize that the market continues to change, that brands are really important in the mobile space, but so is focus. And the notion of building lots of small things really doesn't pay out the way it does in mobile like it did just a few years ago. And their decision was to refocus and really energize around a few core PopCap IP and that drove a slight change in structure there. But you shouldn't read into anything other than we are very, very committed to PopCap and very committed to PopCap IP, and very committed to bringing that wonderful IP to players across devices in the future. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Next question? Operator Our last question is from the line of Evan Wingren with Pacific Crest Securities. Evan Wingren - Pacific Crest Securities Thanks. So what are your expectations for this next edition of Madden as it moves to Frostbite? And are there any potential synergies that you guys are thinking about for moving the game to that engine? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. What Frostbite allows us to do, as you can see what it allowed on FIFA is to have a much deeper experience, much better graphics, doing things inside the game that you couldn't do on a sports engine. So if you were to look at FIFA and say, how did FIFA change year-over-year, you'll probably see similar aspects of that in Madden. And we're pretty excited about it. It looks fantastic so far. Evan Wingren - Pacific Crest Securities Okay. And then, Andrew, in your remarks you called out AI and I'm just wondering how are you utilizing it now. And I use that term broadly. And how do you see it evolving over the next couple of years? Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. We see kind of on three core vectors. Again, we make artificial humans inside of video games and have been doing that for many decades, and the sophistication of those human beings inside of our games continues to grow. And so we have a lot of energy about how do we improve the AI of our characters inside games so that their performance is far more believable and far more human. A second vector is just how we think about pathing and difficulty inside of our games, so with the growing population of players across devices, the notion that one size fits all with respect to experience is no longer relevant. And so we have a lot of work going into how we think about a dynamic experience, a dynamic and personalized experience for every single player in our network, even as they play the same games with their friends on similar devices. And it's really about how do we change difficulty level, how do we change pathing, how do we provide the tools and feedback that those players need so that they can get the single best experience and ultimately engage with the game longer. And then the third vector, of course, is just how we think about recommendations and presentation of content and merchandising of content and marketing of the content that we produce to a global player base. We have deep investment going on in all three vectors. We think we're leading in a number of categories. A lot of that will start to manifest itself inside of our EA Player Network. You're already seeing some of that in Ultimate Team, in our Sims games, in our Battlefield network that moves you amongst experiences. And we believe that in the not-too-distant future that's going to be a meaningful vector of growth for our business. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. So one last question. Operator Our last question is from the line of Ray Stochel with Consumer Edge Research. Raymond L. Stochel - Consumer Edge Research LLC Great. Thanks for taking the question. How are you guys thinking now about the Nintendo Switch post launch? And is this in your new Gen console installed base forecast? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. So we feel really good about it. Again, we came out early and said that we'll be supporting the Nintendo Switch with our biggest title in FIFA. We have a tremendous relationship with Nintendo and have done for many, many years and are excited by the fact that they have come out very strong and are bringing in a whole new player base into the ecosystem. We continue to be bullish on it and are looking at other titles that we might bring to the Switch. Our console number that we quoted does not include the Switch at this point, so anything that Nintendo does is additive to that number. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Great.

We'll pause for just a brief moment while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question is from the line of Justin Post of Bank of America. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Blake, in your guidance you talk about gross margins, looks like being up. Can you talk about the Star Wars impact there? And then maybe also how the other digital content is kind of helping the margins in the year. So kind of frame those two inputs this year into the gross margin outlook. Thank you. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. Yeah. Sure, Justin. Before I do that I wanted to make just a quick announcement about our IR team. Carolyn, who almost all of you, I think, have met or know, has been with us for three years and is moving to our corporate FP&A team, which is a great move for her, and we thank Carolyn for an amazing three years of support to all of the investors and sell-side analysts. We have a new person joining the team, Erin. You'll get a chance to meet her in the coming months and we look forward to having her on our team. But thanks to Carolyn. So to your question, Justin, first, if you look back to the difference between the year before the first Star Wars, fiscal 2015 and then fiscal 2016, you saw a fairly muted growth in gross margin, up about 50 basis points roughly. We expect a similar effect this year because of the impact of the royalty on a very large title as we saw last time. And the comparison was, remember this year a pretty tough comp because our gross margin was actually higher than we had originally anticipated because we sold more Battlefield than we anticipated and less Titanfall than we anticipated. Titanfall obviously has a royalty to Respawn and we expected that, but we got a little bit more bump in gross margin We will see gross improvement as we continue to grow the live service part of our business, Ultimate Team and other similar live services on top of existing games. But for now we're only expecting a little less than 100 basis points or around 50 basis points because of that, primarily of that impact on Star Wars Battlefront II. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Next question, operator. Operator Our next question is from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Blake, can you just talk a little bit about your view on esports and kind of your esports strategy? There's some people regarding going  and how do you think about monetizing esports the next couple of years? And then secondly, can you just talk a little bit about your expectations and guidance for FIFA Ultimate Team off of the pretty tough comps and the great performance from last year? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. Sure. I'll let Andrew address the broader esports strategy. I think the thing to remember is it's built around Ultimate Team for our core sports games and we'll most likely build it around in a similar style live service for non-sports games in the future. But I'll let Andrew talk little bit about that. I'll come back on the Ultimate Team question. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. Yeah. We're very excited about our esports strategy and what we're doing, and what we saw this year in both FIFA and Madden were significantly higher engagement and monetization inside of Ultimate Team for those competing in esports tournaments. And again, this isn't just about the big championship tournaments. We run a whole series of events at a grassroots level all the way up to the elite level of tournaments. And so we think about this in a similar way that we think about all sports, which is we want to make stars of all of our players, the novice player as well as the professional player. And while there will almost certainly be solid revenue generation from broadcast rights, from sponsorship, from advertising, from players and teams and the monetization of those things, the lion share of the revenue will always be the digital transactions that exist in the ecosystem. We see that in leading esports tournaments and leading esports games already. And what we have seen in FIFA Ultimate Team and Madden Ultimate Team over the past 12 months confirms what our original strategy was, which was we will drive those other things. We will benefit from those other things. The lion share of return will come from the ongoing engagement and live service component that is things like Ultimate Team. And you should expect as we launch other esports games that they will also revolve around a very robust and rich digital ecosystem similar to Ultimate Team. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. And in terms of guidance relative to Ultimate Team, the thing to remember that was  two major drivers in FIFA this year were, first, the addition of a story mode in the game. The Journey brought new people into the game and brought those people from the game into Ultimate Team. So it grew the overall base of people playing in Ultimate Team. The second is the addition of the competitive gaming mode inside of FIFA which, as Andrew mentioned, drove massive engagement around tournaments and around practicing for tournaments. Both of those styles of change we're going to try to adapt into Madden in one way or another, and you'll see more of that coming in the coming months. But you can assume we've learned a lot of great lessons from FIFA. We'll try to drive Madden Ultimate Team and Madden Competitive Gaming off of similar modes. But FIFA doesn't sit still. It continues to find new ways to engage people in new modes and new excitement, and as Andrew said, we'll be evolving The Journey in FIFA, which will continue to bring new people into the game, we believe. That's the core. Now our guidance doesn't anticipate anywhere near the level of growth that we actually achieved this year. We tend to do that each year with FIFA because while it's very predictable based around events, we've continued to surprise ourselves on the upside. So you should trust that it's a rational number in terms of our guidance, but there is growth in there. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Next question? Operator Our next question is from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC So, Andrew, I think the decision to add The Journey to FIFA was based on user feedback, and that seems to be yielding dividends. So what kind of user feedback have you gathered from the first iteration of Battlefront that you will be looking to add to Battlefront II. And, Blake, will you give us a sense of what percent of your mobile bookings are growing with the new games? And what percent of your bookings are from the legacy games that are now in decline? So wondering when we'll mathematically see a change in the growth trajectory as the mix changes. Thanks Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. Yeah. So, thank you. As you know, Battlefront I was a great game, and widely regarded as the best way to fulfill your Star Wars fantasies. Frostbite really brought the Star Wars universe to life, but there were some things that a number of players asked for. A single player campaign was probably the number one thing that players asked for, and you heard that we'll be doing that. And I'm very excited by what we're seeing there. The Motive Studios who is a collection of developers who have a tremendous track record in building action-adventure and single player campaigns is putting that together. They wanted things like space battles and more vehicles and more heroes and more eras and more planets, and what you heard from us is that it will have all of those things. We took the feedback very, very seriously. We've invested in a very meaningful way, and when we say we believe the game is three times the size in terms of content, we're very serious about that. And our expectation is that the large, engaged passionate fan base of Star Wars fans around the world are going to love everything that we're doing. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. In terms of mobile, our net sales for the year were up 10% year-on-year. We're not happy with that. We think we can continue to grow that more, but I remind people that we didn't bring out NBA mobile and FIFA mobile until the back half of the year in October, essentially, and we've continued to learn and tune those games around the world. So we should continue to see more growth out of those. We've had some amazing performers like the Simpsons: Tapped Out or Real Racing or Sims FreePlay that are in year four or year five of their lives and the fact that they're still going is pretty impressive relative to many mobile games. But we will see a natural decline in some of those as we add less content and move to players to new, more exciting games or new versions of those games. And so, I don't know when you're going to see a more dramatic growth level. We've guided to around 5% to 10% of growth for the year, but we certainly are focused on trying to drive the new Sims title, as Andrew mentioned, as well as the sports titles because we feel that those are fabulous formula that we've been able to develop and leverage, both on the console and PC world as well as now in the mobile world. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Next question. Operator Our next question is from the line of Tim O'shea with Jefferies. Timothy Larkin O'shea - Jefferies LLC Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a few more on Star Wars Battlefront II. So the first installment sold around 13 million units in its launch window. Obviously, a very number. Is this the right framework to use as we think about how to model Battlefront II? And then, there's been a bit of confusion on how you intend to support the game post-launch and I just was hoping you might clarify what we should expect in terms of season pass or DLC. And then, just broadly speaking at a higher level, how is the anticipation for that game shaping up? What's the feedback you're seeing around the announcement of the single-player campaign and the trailer? Thank you. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. So again, in terms of, we'll start from the back. The fan anticipation has been very, very strong; 16 million organic views. That's not us paying the viewers. That is fans seeking out the content. I would say the feedback has been almost entirely positive. The inclusion of a single-player campaign, the inclusion of a new heroine in Iden, space battles, new content, new heroes, new world, new planets. I think the feedback of that is very, very strong. As we think about the live services, nothing  I'm not talking in great deal about it now other than, the game is going to be three times the size of the original game at launch and we also have a very, very robust live services plan that we're going to talk about in the coming weeks and months, particularly around EA PLAY and E3 in just a few weeks' time. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. Yes. And I think on the unit forecast, we sold 14 million units of Battlefront I in the year it was shipped and built into our guidance as essentially the same number. Our aspirations are clearly to sell more. We think this will appeal to not just the broad Star Wars fan base, but also to the deep, heavily-engaged Battlefield fan base and Battlefront fan base. And we see that as a critical part of the success of this game going forward and as Andrew mentioned, we've got the depth and the breadth in the games that will help that. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Next question? Operator Our next question's from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two on mobile. I wanted to know if we could tease-out a little bit about where you saw strength in mobile versus some of the legacy titles that might have been a drag on mobile just so we can tease-out some of the headwinds and tailwinds in the Mobile business. And then second, any sense of marketing and how it's being impacted in terms of trying to drive mobile engagement? Is there any change there, or you're actually leaning in against some of the key titles on the mobile engagement front? Thanks, guys. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. Yes. Thanks, Eric. The core product portfolio that's been there for four or five years like the Simpsons I mentioned, have actually shrunk. Games like Sims FreePlay have stayed fairly consistent but not grown dramatically. And then things like FIFA, NBA, and particularly Galaxy of Heroes have grown dramatically. And so, I think what you'll see as we layer in games like the new Sims game and the sports games continue to grow, you'll continue to see that hopefully offset any of the shrinkage in the older portfolio. Those numbers for the older portfolio are starting to get fairly small and stable, and so I don't think you'll see a lot of headwind from that. In terms of marketing. We're continuing a very ROI-driven marketing approach that's got a lot of discipline around it. We have a whole team led by our Chief Marketing Officer that focuses not just on our console and PC marketing, but very much on the mobile marketing. And they're driving decisions almost daily as to how to support the products. That's the beauty of the business is, when something's working well you can tune up the daily marketing. When it's not, you can tune it down. I would say, though, that we remain very focused on leveraging known IP that we own or license to try to offset some of the costs of marketing and has allowed us to run our mobile business at a level of profitability we believe higher than most, as well as, driven by the fact we're spending less on ROI-driven marketing. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Next question? Operator Our next question is from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So I wonder if you guys could comment on your experience with Battlefield 1 DLC. What the conversion rate was in the March quarter and what your expectations are for fiscal 2018? I believe you guys had four maps launching this fiscal period. And then second question is more a clarification. Your commentary on full-game downloads being 9% last year, but moving back to 5%, is that a number for the company or something you expect the industry to trend at? And if it's not for you, where would you expect it to be given the Star Wars versus Battlefield dynamic? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. Yeah. So thanks, Drew. The first question on Battlefield 1. We're not going to disclose attach rates because they're becoming less and less meaningful, particularly in a world of live services. And you'll see some changes to our approach, particularly with Battlefield and Battlefront over time that makes those DLC less important because it's ongoing content that's being delivered. I will say, you'll also see a lot of content delivered to the broad community for Battlefield, not just for the DLC owners going forward, which I think will continue to make those numbers a little less meaningful. We're very pleased with the engagement levels on Battlefield, as well as the ongoing sales of Battlefield 1, and we think that will continue on. And I guess what I would say is, based on having seen some of the DLCs, I would never refer to them as a map. We've got a lot of exciting stuff coming and a lot of interesting things about World War I that have yet to be even seen. In terms of full-game downloads. The number surprised us because we had thought that it'd be around the 5% year-over-year growth. Some of that may simply be the consumer is shifting faster than we know or we expected. The trends can sometimes jump in dramatic ways and maybe we're starting to see that overall shift. And some of it could be product-related. We do think the industry will end calendar year 2017 probably above 40%. We will most likely lag that as we have historically because FIFA is such a large product and it is so global that we are operating in markets where either the ability to purchase digitally, or the ability to download based on bandwidth speeds, are compromised and thus we tend to skew a little lower on FIFA than we do on the rest of our portfolio. So we've always lagged the industry slightly, but we are excited about the potential that you're seeing the consumer possibly shift quicker to digital than we'd originally anticipated. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Next question? Operator Our next question's from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Oppenheimer & Company. Andrew Uerkwitz - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker) Yeah. Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I've just got two quick ones. Around Battlefield 1, it seems like the excitement around the game is a little bit better than you expected. Has that changed your view on the intensity or the strategy around extra content for this fiscal year? And then, could we see more in the following fiscal year to support Battlefield 1? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. I would say it hasn't really changed our overall approach for this fiscal year. You may see some things you didn't actually anticipate as it evolves, but the general strategy is still based around quarterly or monthly DLCs that we put out. I do think you'll start to see that evolve next year as we get into more competitive gaming and it will clearly evolve, as Andrew mentioned, around Battlefront II property that we start to evolve the services associated with DLC to make them more live service, event-driven style gameplay versus purely an additional piece of content. Andrew Uerkwitz - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker) On that particular comment, if I may, are you kind of leaning towards kind of (44:10-44:18) Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. You cut out. Operator Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. Doris, why don't go onto the next question? We'll come back to Andrew. Operator Our next question is from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen & Co. Doug Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC Yes. Thanks. I think your revenue-deferred adjusted gross margin this quarter was a bit over 81%, which is I think more than 400 basis points higher than your previous high in any quarter you've reported. Obviously, you had a big digital mix this quarter. But there's been other quarters in the last couple of years where you've had similar digital mix, and the gross margins have been in the mid-70%. So wondered if you could talk about  was there anything special in this quarter that drove the gross margin so high? Mix of business, or anything like that? Thanks. Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. Yes. I think primarily the biggest driver I would say is the mix, lower royalty-bearing titles this year versus last year  Battlefield catalog, for example, versus Battlefront catalog last year. There was also  the one thing to remember is our technology team, led by Ken Moss, has done an amazing job making our back office ability to deliver digital much more efficient. We don't talk about it a lot, but it's become a continued help in our gross margin as we expand. And we'll continue to drive that. That's lower cost storage, lower cost delivery, more efficient network and platform that we've built it on. It's all pretty powerful, and that continues to help us as well. And then obviously continued digital, as we said, is also a major driver in the business which has helped us in the quarter. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. Doris, next question, please? Operator Our next question is from the line of San Phan with Mizuho. San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Hi. It's San. Two questions on my end. How far along are you in building and staffing out Motive Studio in Canada? And how should we think about that impact to the trajectory in R&D expenses over the next two years? And then secondly, can we just get your current thoughts on what areas are most interesting to you in the industry in regards to potential M&A? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. So I'm sorry, San. I didn't catch the first part of your first question. Can you repeat the question? San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Oh. Sure. It's just how far along are you in building out and staffing out the Motive Studio in Canada? And basically, what's the impact to the trajectory in R&D? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. Yeah. It's a good question. Thanks. We're well along the way. We've hired close to 100 people for that studio  some of the most fabulous talent I've met in many, many years. It's very exciting for us to assemble a brand new team. We're finalizing our new office space there, which will have both Motive people as well as the BioWare Montréal team in that same office. We still have some hiring to go, but I think for now it'll be at a more gradual pace over the next couple of years as we move probably from, say, 100 to 150 or so as we go forward, so. But it's been exciting to be able to build such a great new team. And in terms of the second piece on M&A, I think there are few large companies out there, and most of the companies are small. Many of the companies we've looked at we've passed on because the valuations have been so high, but we're continuing to keep our eyes and ears open, particularly for things that could add to either games that don't have live services and we can layer live services into them or games that could leverage our network and our scale that we don't have. And those will be big themes for us, but unfortunately, it's not a long list of companies that are out there of scale that we can go after. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Next question? Operator Our next question is the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hey. Good afternoon. Couple quick ones here. Despite moving out an entire title, guidance is quite solid on a tough comp, and then your digital guidance is up nicely, even with Star Wars, which last time was a bit of a drag on digital. So would you say that the biggest component of the favorable overall guide and digital guide is mostly the result of strength of Battlefield 1 live services? Or would you attribute it to something else? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. I would probably attribute it to live services in general, so not just Battlefield, but the overall portfolio, both mobile and non-mobile where we're trying to layer more live services and are seeing success. We're seeing obviously  we have expectations for growth across the sports portfolio, both in HD and in mobile. We do have a new UFC game, I think as everyone knows, next spring and we have the Need for Speed game coming in. So all of those add to the growth in the year, despite the fact that we have a tough comp to try to beat between Battlefield, Titanfall and the strength of FIFA this past year. So we see it as kind of growth across the whole portfolio versus dominated by one product or one new product. And we do have the new Sims game that Andrew mentioned that's coming out during the year on mobile. We don't know exactly what time of year that will come out, so we don't have a giant expectation in the guidance, but that's clearly in there as well. Operator Our next question's from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark. Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me as well. Curious if you could give us a deeper perspective, I guess on what's happening within BioWare. Mass Effect I think from a quality perspective didn't exactly hit the mark and it looks like we've now delayed the anticipated new IP which sometimes is also tied to quality. So curious if there's any change in leadership or developer turnover. What sort of cap internally within BioWare? And then second question's PopCap. It looks like you have some layoffs in that studio. Obviously, that studio has good IP, used to, as well as [talent]. I'm sort of curious how you see the future of PopCap. And also with tinkering with head count on the overall firm or any trends there we should think about through fiscal 2018. Thanks, guys. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. So let me just make sure that was only two questions and not three or four. The first one is what's going on with BioWare; and should we read anything in from Mass Effect to the new title? So that's that collection of questions. And the question was what's going on at PopCap and should we read anything in there? Was there a third question about head count overall? Or was that just head count related to PopCap? Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. We lost Mike now. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. Mike? Operator Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. Okay. Well, I'll answer... Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Only the first two. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. And we'll go from there. The first thing is, is Mass Effect is an interesting title. It was in development for a really long time and represented a lot of the great things that BioWare is known for: story, size, depth, breadth, imagination. And while overall, the aggregate review scores were lower than we would have liked, we did have over 100 reviewers score the game at 80 or higher. So it represents a fan base that's very passionate; looking for very particular things. And many players found exactly what they're looking for and some players did not. With that said, we believe Mass Effect Andromeda delivers a rich, deep experience which celebrates what makes the franchise great: wonderful, beautiful, deep rich worlds, amazing combat and engaging fast-paced, multiplayer. New multiplayer content is continuing to be released and new content kind of arriving overall more regularly so. We're very happy with kind of how BioWare is doing, how BioWare is treating Mass Effect. And our expectations for Mass Effect are still strong for the future and the franchise overall. In terms of the new IP, the choice to move the new IP and what happened with Mass Effect are completely unrelated. The realities is we have a creative process. As a company, creativity and pioneering is really important for us. Now, innovation in games is important more now than ever. And as a leader in the industry, we see it as our responsibility to innovate. And as part of our creative process  and I get to be involved in that creative process  we recognize that there was so much more opportunity in a connected network social world to do some things in the new BioWare game that had never done before and we don't think anyone is going to do anytime soon. But by virtue of our network, our cross-platform presence and our scale, we think we can do that. And we chose to give the team some more time to deliver against that innovation because we believe players are looking for the kinds of things that we plan to put into that game. And so we're very happy with BioWare. BioWare has continued to support Mass Effect, and the new team is doing some amazing things, and you'll hear more about that in the months to come. In terms of PopCap, again, I think there's a couple of different presence for PopCap. We have an amazing PopCap team in Vancouver that built Garden Warfare 1 and 2 on consol. That game continues to do extremely well, high critical acclaim, strong engagement, and strong sales over its life, so we're very happy with that team. The team's building against Mobile Games out of Seattle, recognize that the market continues to change, that brands are really important in the mobile space, but so is focus. And the notion of building lots of small things really doesn't pay out the way it does in mobile like it did just a few years ago. And their decision was to refocus and really energize around a few core PopCap IP and that drove a slight change in structure there. But you shouldn't read into anything other than we are very, very committed to PopCap and very committed to PopCap IP, and very committed to bringing that wonderful IP to players across devices in the future. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Next question? Operator Our last question is from the line of Evan Wingren with Pacific Crest Securities. Evan Wingren - Pacific Crest Securities Thanks. So what are your expectations for this next edition of Madden as it moves to Frostbite? And are there any potential synergies that you guys are thinking about for moving the game to that engine? Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc. What Frostbite allows us to do, as you can see what it allowed on FIFA is to have a much deeper experience, much better graphics, doing things inside the game that you couldn't do on a sports engine. So if you were to look at FIFA and say, how did FIFA change year-over-year, you'll probably see similar aspects of that in Madden. And we're pretty excited about it. It looks fantastic so far. Evan Wingren - Pacific Crest Securities Okay. And then, Andrew, in your remarks you called out AI and I'm just wondering how are you utilizing it now. And I use that term broadly. And how do you see it evolving over the next couple of years? Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. We see kind of on three core vectors. Again, we make artificial humans inside of video games and have been doing that for many decades, and the sophistication of those human beings inside of our games continues to grow. And so we have a lot of energy about how do we improve the AI of our characters inside games so that their performance is far more believable and far more human. A second vector is just how we think about pathing and difficulty inside of our games, so with the growing population of players across devices, the notion that one size fits all with respect to experience is no longer relevant. And so we have a lot of work going into how we think about a dynamic experience, a dynamic and personalized experience for every single player in our network, even as they play the same games with their friends on similar devices. And it's really about how do we change difficulty level, how do we change pathing, how do we provide the tools and feedback that those players need so that they can get the single best experience and ultimately engage with the game longer. And then the third vector, of course, is just how we think about recommendations and presentation of content and merchandising of content and marketing of the content that we produce to a global player base. We have deep investment going on in all three vectors. We think we're leading in a number of categories. A lot of that will start to manifest itself inside of our EA Player Network. You're already seeing some of that in Ultimate Team, in our Sims games, in our Battlefield network that moves you amongst experiences. And we believe that in the not-too-distant future that's going to be a meaningful vector of growth for our business. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. So one last question. Operator Our last question is from the line of Ray Stochel with Consumer Edge Research. Raymond L. Stochel - Consumer Edge Research LLC Great. Thanks for taking the question. How are you guys thinking now about the Nintendo Switch post launch? And is this in your new Gen console installed base forecast? Thanks. Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc. So we feel really good about it. Again, we came out early and said that we'll be supporting the Nintendo Switch with our biggest title in FIFA. We have a tremendous relationship with Nintendo and have done for many, many years and are excited by the fact that they have come out very strong and are bringing in a whole new player base into the ecosystem. We continue to be bullish on it and are looking at other titles that we might bring to the Switch. Our console number that we quoted does not include the Switch at this point, so anything that Nintendo does is additive to that number. Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc. Great.

Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Seth Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Operator Good day and welcome to Expedia's Q1 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Alan Pickerill, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc. Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to Expedia, Inc.'s financial results conference call for first quarter ended March 31, 2017. I am pleased to be joined on the call today by Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia's CEO and President; and Mark Okerstrom, our CFO and EVP of Operations. The following discussion including responses to your questions reflects management's views as of today, April 27, 2017 only. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise the information. As always, some of the statements made on today's call are forward-looking, typically preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC for information about factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. You'll find reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures discussed today in our earnings release, which is posted on the company's IR website at ir.expediainc.com. I encourage you to periodically visit our Investor Relations site for important content, including today's earnings release. I would like to note that beginning here in Q1 2017, we are including HomeAway on-platform gross bookings and property nights in our operational metrics. We've disclosed the quarterly balances for 2016 via an 8-K filing for comparative purposes. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all references to cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and technology and content expense, also exclude stock-based compensation and depreciation expense and all comparisons on this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. With that, let me turn the call over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Thanks, Alan. Expedia is off to a good start this year with first quarter gross bookings up 14%, revenue up 15% and adjusted EBITDA up 18% year-over-year. Stayed room nights grew 12%, negatively impacted by the Easter shift, while booked room nights grew 18% year-over-year. The Core OTA segment continue to gain momentum with the global brands delivering healthy room night growth through solid execution and product, technology, marketing and operations. We continue tuning our regional brand operating formula with an eye towards optimizing profitability and with some trade-offs against top-line growth. Note that the travel markets are quite dynamic, and it's been less than a year since we fully optimized Orbitz, integrated Orbitz into the fold. We're early here in our learnings. Our OTA lodging supply portfolio now stands at about 385,000 properties, up 36% year-over-year. The HomeAway transition continues to go well. We're investing in growing our team of top-tier product and technology talent, and we shifted to a true test and learn culture to drive significant improvements in the overall user, homeowner and property manager experience. We're still relatively early in developing our muscles in the variable marketing channels, but we're beginning to ramp them up in addition to making aggressive investments in offline and online brand marketing to bring more demand to our growing supply base. We now have nearly 1.4 million online bookable listings, representing over 2 million bookable units and an increasing percentage of instantly bookable properties. Egencia delivered impressive adjusted EBITDA of $27 million in Q1, up 76% year-over-year, helped in part by lapping over the Orbitz for Business integration last year. We believe the business has reached an operational and technological inflection point and can now begin to scale at a more aggressive pace around the world. We're ramping up Egencia's sales organization to accelerate organic bookings and revenue growth. While this will be a headwind to near-term margins, as we bring in salespeople and train them up to Egencia standards, we believe we can balance this investment through the natural P&L leverage in the business at its current and go-forward scale. Lastly, trivago continued its very strong pace of growth with standalone revenue growth of 62% and $21 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. Growth was strong across all regions with the highest rate of growth in APAC along with solid growth in Europe and North America. The trivago team plans to continue to invest into growth, and we'll share more details on their earnings call in mid-May. We're happy to have begun the year from a position of strength. Our Core OTA and Egencia businesses are posting attractive top line growth rates, investing aggressively in selling and marketing while leveraging their fixed cost base. After that, the impressive growth of HomeAway and trivago and smart capital allocation, and you get an effective formula for long-term value creation. It's early in the year with plenty of competition in the field, but we like where we stand now. Mark? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Thanks, Dara. With both feet firmly back into business as usual mode, we're happy to have kicked off 2017 with a strong set of results. Total lodging revenue, including both hotel revenue and all of the HomeAway revenue, grew 12% for the first quarter, driven by stayed room night growth at the same rate. Normalized for Easter and last year's leap day, we estimate room night growth would have been approximately 300 basis points higher. Our global brands, Hotels.com, Brand Expedia, EAN and Egencia collectively delivered room night growth of 17%, a growth rate that would have been nicely higher if normalized for Easter. HomeAway revenue grew 30% to $185 million, driven by property night growth and increased revenue per property night. HomeAway property nights grew 39% year-over-year on a booked basis, while HomeAway stayed property night growth of 12% was particularly impacted by seasonality and the Easter shift. Property night revenue has improved as a result of our service fees, partially offset by decreased subscription revenue as we continue to lap over the elimination of tiered subscription sales in July of 2016 and as we transition more of our listings to the paper booking model and to our lower online bookable subscription rates. As expected, HomeAway's EBITDA was down year-over-year as a result of seasonal impacts to revenue coupled with aggressive investments in selling and marketing and technology and content. We currently expect HomeAway's 2017 revenue growth to peak in Q3, a quarter in which HomeAway will deliver the significant majority of its adjusted EBITDA dollar growth. Lastly, as a reminder, we will also start to see somewhat easier expense comps for HomeAway in the back half of the year as we begin to lap the ramp-up of certain selling and marketing and technology and content spend late last year. Advertising and media revenue of $257 million is up 47% year-over-year, a nice acceleration from the 36% growth we saw in Q4. On a standalone basis, trivago revenue grew 62% year-over-year and delivered $21 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, a bit ahead of our expectations. The trivago formula is working, and the team plans to reinvest some of the upside to-date in selling and marketing to drive continued impressive qualified referral growth around the world. trivago continues to nicely outpace other scale customer acquisition channels in travel. Our adjusted expenses trended in the right direction, and we're in line with our target P&L, something we also expect to see for the full year. We're driving leverage on our fixed costs, which allows us to make aggressive investments in selling and marketing. Cost of revenue grew just 3% year-over-year in Q1, leveraging nicely on efficiency in our credit card and fraud costs and our global customer operations platform, partially offset by growth in our cloud spending. While we continue to expect to see leverage in cost of revenue, we are forecasting somewhat higher growth rates for the rest of the year. Direct selling and marketing expenses grew 25% as we continued to push for global growth, primarily led by aggressive spending at trivago and HomeAway, along with continued growth for Brand Expedia and Hotels.com. Indirect selling and marketing, which represents people costs, grew 7% year-over-year. We currently expect total selling and marketing cost to grow faster than revenue for the balance of the year. G&A expenses grew 6% in Q1, leveraging nicely, which we expect to see for the full year as well. Technology and content were just 2% year-over-year as we are lapping over the accelerated pace of hiring and the Orbitz integration-related head count we carried in the first half of 2016. As expected, continued growth of the HomeAway team led to faster technology content expense growth for that business. In total, though we expect technology and content expenses to grow faster next quarter and accelerate further in the back half, on a full year basis, we currently expect to be able to deliver slight leverage on this line item, fully inclusive of the planned cloud spend. On that note, I'm pleased to say that our cloud migration efforts are going well. Total cloud spending for the quarter was $16 million, up from $6 million last year with nearly 60% of that spend in cost of revenue and about 40% of it in technology and content. We remain comfortable with our estimate of total cloud costs of $110 million in 2017 and though difficult to predict with certainty, we expect the full year mix to be roughly even between cost of revenue and technology and content. From a capital deployment standpoint, we have repurchased nearly 450,000 shares so far in 2017 for a total of $54 million. Our longstanding approach to capital deployment has not changed, and we continue to balance share repurchases, our quarterly dividend and opportunistic M&A. Turning to our financial expectations for full year 2017, on a consolidated basis, including the ramp-up in cloud spending, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% to 15%. Excluding cloud expenses, growth would be 14% to 19%. Separately, we have trimmed our CapEx forecast a bit and now expect CapEx excluding cost related to our headquarters project to be down year-over-year. For the full year, we are expecting depreciation expense to grow in the mid-20% range with the pace of growth decelerating from Q1 through the end of the year. With that, let's turn to questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator We'll go first to Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Yes. Hi. Thank you very much. Just on  two quick questions. So first, on HomeAway, Dara, can you talk about the conversion rates on the instantly bookable properties, what kind of trend you have seen to date and what should we expect going forward, given that you are willing to spend so much on the variable channels? And then I have a follow-up. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Sure. In general, we are seeing overall conversion rates at HomeAway continue to increase on a year-on-year basis and continuing to increase at healthy rates. So when you look at the booking trends, which are strong and positive, it's a combination of traffic to HomeAway increasing on a year-on-year basis. It's double digits. We're being hurt by SEO but certainly being helped by other traffic sources, including the investment that we're making in the variable channels. And then the team is optimizing around booking conversion, and booking conversion is up at healthy rates on a year-on-year basis, although we feel that we have a long way to go. In general, the move towards what we're trying to make are two moves. One is from offline to online bookable, and we have over 85% of our properties now online bookable. And then we're also making the transition over from online bookable to instant bookable. That's still earlier and we think that the move to instant booking will continue to be a tailwind as it relates to overall conversion rates. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay. And then just sort of drilling a little bit into the  into your response, so what should we expect about your ability to tweak the best sort for the remain- as we look into the remainder of the year? So I guess, with the ungrandfathering of the subscriptions, you would probably have more flexibility to do that. What would be the cadence of your tweak to the thing? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Yeah. I'd say the cadence is unpredictable. These are  we're putting in sort changes on a daily, weekly basis. You are right to conclude that as the paid tier subscription or the higher tier subscriptions roll off, we have greater room for optimization. And we think we're very, very early in the overall optimization. So the sort teams continue to roll out new algorithms and, in general, the algorithms are getting better and better. And this is really before we put machine learning into play as well. These are, call it, more static algorithms that are being optimized, and I think machine learning can take this to a different level. And we're really one year in here. So we got a long, long way to go. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. And Naved, as a reminder, that tiered subscriptions will completely become a non-issue starting in July of this year. So at that point, we've got complete freedom, but as Dara said, there's lots of tests already going on. Operator We'll go next to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks very much for the question. A couple, if I could. Last quarter, you talked about improving the homeowner dashboard control to help property owners better understand the algorithms. Wondering if any of those improvements have rolled out yet and if so, what the feedback has been. And then secondly, wondering if you could give us any color on Orbitz? Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Sure. As far as the owner dashboard, we have  there's been a significant amount of development going into the owner dashboard. In general, we want to arm up the owners with significantly more data, both in terms of their earning power, in terms of the kinds of folks looking at their properties and really how they can capture more share within our marketplace. I would expect some pretty significant releases over the year. I think we're pretty early. We've introduced some better calendar management, for example. We've optimized the traveler app for the checkout experiences. We've launched House Rules that inform travelers of what's expected of them before they book, but I think these are really the basics, and we're just getting started here. I do think we can do a better job, in general, in explaining to owners what they can and should be doing to improve their sorts. One of the significant factors is content, the quality of content as far as pictures goes, the quality of content as far as what to expect when you get into the home and, obviously, reviews. And I do think that this is an area that when we talk to our owners, we get some feedback that we can be doing better, and the HomeAway team is certainly focused on making sure owners understand exactly why they are getting the demand that they're getting and how they can optimize and improve their demand inside the marketplace. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. And then, Peter, in terms of Orbitz, I'd say generally, we're pretty pleased with the way that the  what was the old Orbitz and is now part of Expedia, Inc. is performing. In terms of just some specifics on that, from a top-line perspective, the business is still declining and, call it, the mid-teens range. As a reminder, the reason for this is there's a number of formerly Orbitz Partner Network customers that we didn't migrate over, a number of points of sale for e-workers that we didn't migrate over, some Orbitz for Business customers that we didn't migrate over. But if you back out the impact of that, the core of the business looks good. The conversion rates we're seeing on hotel looks solid and of course, the cost synergies that we really brought in to fruition through 2016 are there in full force. So we're happy with what we see. We are still optimizing the Orbitz businesses and getting that right marketing formula in place to optimize for profit margin and of course, profit margin in these businesses looks absolutely excellent. Next question, please? Operator We'll go next to Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Should we expect HomeAway online gross bookings to follow similar seasonal trends as last year or as you are able to pivot the business to a more transactional model, should we expect a more smooth seasonal pattern? And then additionally for HomeAway, can you provide a breakdown between traveler fee or transactional revenue versus subscription and other? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Sure. I'll answer the first, Jed. We are getting used to HomeAway booking patterns and stay patterns at this point. So we can't answer your question with absolute certainty. It actually looks to us like the seasonal stay patterns are going to become more pronounced. What we're seeing is that the early entrants into the HomeAway marketplace or property managers who might have had more apartments kind of the professionally managed concept apartments. We're seeing the average dollar value per property booking with HomeAway move up, which means that the bigger homes are coming online, and the demand is moving over to the bigger homes. Those larger homes tend to be more seasonal in nature, so we would actually expect to see a higher percentage of dollar stays if for HomeAway concentrated in Q3 than what you saw last year. Mark, you want to answer the HomeAway traveler fee versus transactional revenue? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Yes, sure. Yeah. So we're not going to give the quarterly number but just as a reminder, what we said was that by the end of 2017 here, we'd be at about 25% subscription and no change. We're really on track to turn that way. Operator We'll go next to Ross Sandler with Barclays. Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. This is Deepak on for Ross. Can you talk about the levels of marketing spend that are going into different components between the OTA brands and HomeAway this year? I think HomeAway was expected to ramp. And then given the several quarters we are into the integration, are the practices that are employed typically in Expedia to optimize for conversions currently put into place in HomeAway at this stage? How do you view their efficiency of marketing programs? I have one more follow-up after that. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Yeah. I think on the second question, most definitely, the CEO of HomeAway is John Kim, and John was the Head of Product at Expedia. So you can imagine that we have taken a number of Expedia practices and we have combined them with HomeAway practices that come up with, call it, the best-of-breed both in terms of design and in product and in technology as well. So, the HomeAway team is driving a lot more experimentation, significantly more A/B testing and the pace of change and testing on that site now is  while it's not up to, call it, Expedia or Hotels.com standards, it has significantly accelerated versus where they were a year ago, and I anticipate it's going to significantly accelerate going into next year, which is going to help conversion rates and is also going to help our ability to market into variable channels. We have moved over talent from online marketing from Hotels.com to HomeAway as well. So there's a bunch of talent moving over. The trends in terms of conversion are good. It's translating into higher online marketing numbers, and it's safe to assume that the HomeAway marketing spend on a year-on-year basis, the increase is higher than the year-on-year increases that you see in our Core OTA. Anything to add there, Mark? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Yeah. I mean, I'd say, I'd put some numbers on it. I think our direct sales and marketing for HomeAway up north of 50% in the first quarter. We will start to see those decelerate, though, as we move through the year, because we're going to lap particularly in the back half of the year the aggressive ramp-up in sales and marketing. That's not in a spot where it's totally moving the needle on our overall sales and marketing numbers yet, although it is a factor. And to your other point around where we're putting dollars across the Core OTA brands, we're really putting money in behind Brand Expedia. We're putting it in behind Hotels.com. Egencia is a driver as well, other segment for us. And when you look at the bulk of our direct sales and marketing spend, which is growing 25% in the quarter, I think about the growth rate in sales and marketing in the Core OTA segment as being pretty close to that, because that's really where it's going. It's going to the big global brands. Operator We'll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. There Doug? Operator Douglas, your line is open. Please check your mute function. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Let's try someone else and maybe Doug will come back. Operator We'll go next to Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC Thanks guys. As you look at the inventory additions this quarter, can you give us any color of the mix overall, hotels versus non-traditional? I guess what I'm getting at is, are you happy with your overall inventory mix, maybe across geographies? Are you happy with the way you're adding non-traditional and hotels? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Yeah. I'd say we're happy, but we think we have a long way to go. The inventory now is at about 385,000 hotels. We are early in the integration of the HomeAway inventory into the mainline OTA inventory. So we're just getting started there, and we have a long way to go. And we think that the pace of inventory addition, I think, we've added, it's up about 36% on a year-on-year basis as far as inventory goes. That kind of a pace is going to continue. It's not going to be consistent every single quarter, but that kind of a base is certainly going to continue. The new hotels continue to perform well within our marketplace. They represent an opportunity for us to spend more marketing dollars as well as to increase conversion on a destination basis as well, and it's just part of the formula right now. It's higher conversion, the higher conversion driving more marketing both online and offline. The more marketing allowing us the ability to add more supply into the marketplace and all of that increasing customer loyalty, which is really the formula that we've had for a long time, and you've got to optimize each portion of that formula a little bit in order to improve. And of course, you have to improve more than the overall market because the market is certainly improving as well. So I think we are in the early middle portion of the game, and we're quite optimistic about the opportunities here over the next 3 to 5 years. Operator We'll go next to Akshay Bhatia with Bank of America. Akshay Bhatia - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. Hi. Thanks for the question. When we look at the Core OTA take rate, looks pretty stable year-over-year. Could you talk about some of the puts and takes, specifically touching on maybe the mix of agency, hotel accelerator, and then maybe some of the negotiations you guys are having with hotel brands? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Yeah. So I think the story is similar to what we've seen for a while. I think on the hotel side, there still is a little bit of a headwind on margin, although that's significantly less than what it's been in the past. That's essentially offset by a couple of factors. One is, we do continue to see a mix shift of the business towards hotel, which is generally going faster than our air business. Secondly, we've seen nice results from ancillary revenues and media revenues that are also buttressing those take rates, and all of those sort of net out to something that's relatively stable. And I think we're happy with generally where we are, and we're particularly happy with some of these ancillary revenue streams in the Core OTA business, like insurance, like our activities business that are performing nicely. Akshay Bhatia - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator We'll go next to Paul Bieber with Credit Suisse. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thanks for taking my questions. First off, how should we think about the room night growth trajectory during the summer booking season for both domestic and international, given the deceleration and especially domestic in the reported numbers? And then just generally, how would you characterize the macro backdrop for travel in the U.S., Europe, and APAC? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Sure. So in terms of room night growth, I'd just remind you that the Easter impact was significant here in the first quarter. We were actually quite happy with what we saw in terms of room night growth and generally pointed to stable to faster in the first quarter on the normalized numbers that we look at. A few things to keep in mind, though, as we move into Q2 and Q3, one is, Easter will be a helper for us in Q2 from a reported basis, and then our comps do start to get easier as we move into Q2, and again, the easiest comp is probably into Q3, so a few things to keep in mind on that front. In terms of the macro landscape in Europe and otherwise, I think largely similar. I think the London attack for us, we could certainly see impact to London but it's hard to tease that out completely from Easter. And our expectation, thing would be to get back to business as usual is that's what we've seen generally with other regions. The elections in France didn't cause too much of a stir for us. The macro backdrop in Europe seems to be reasonably healthy. When we look at the U.S., again, similar stories. Things seem to be reasonably healthy. We have seen a little bit of a slowdown in travel from the Middle East into the U.S. and a few cross-regional patterns like that, but, net-net, from where we see, looks like a healthy market to us. Operator We'll go next to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks. I was just wondering if you could give us a bit of a sense of strategically how you're thinking about the trade-off between sales and marketing leverage and revenue growth. Obviously, you've got the targets out there for EBITDA, but to the extent that we saw the roughly 344 basis points of deleverage in sales and marketing this year or this quarter, can you give us a sense of what you're trying to get or what you think you'll get out of that kind of spend from a revenue growth perspective and where as a company you're happy with that revenue growth being? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Thanks, Heath. I guess, just one note for you in terms of sales and marketing leverage this quarter. This is always a tough quarter for us from a sales and marketing deleverage standpoint, and primary reason is that we're spending sales and marketing essentially against bookings, not against stayed revenues so there's a little bit of a mismatch. That's accentuated this quarter by the fact that we had Easter also shift which, of course, is an impact revenue and nothing to sales and marketing. I'd say, generally, our strategy, though, as it relates to sales and marketing, has not changed. I mean, we are really looking to drive bottom-line adjusted EBITDA dollar growth and, to that end, really, we're looking to spend to drive more volume, get new customers into the platform, have them get a great experience and have them come back to us through the direct channels like apps, like e-mail, et cetera, and the formula is working. And so, most of what you see when you see sales and marketing de-levered with us is largely as a result of mix drivers. It's the fact that we're spending more aggressively and the region is getting bigger, Asia Pacific, for example, than we are in the U.S. and, though even Asia  even though Asia is less efficient from a sales and marketing perspective than the U.S., that's what's driving the mix, and Asia itself is getting more efficient over time. We also see channel shifts in our sales and marketing expense as we drive conversion. It allows us to spend more into variable marketing channels. Again, the direct channels, the chief channels still look very healthy, and they're growing nicely, but essentially we're able to buy more in these variable channels, and that's a factor for us as well. So I think you'll see the same strategy for us. We like to invest aggressively in sales and marketing. We like to fund that with leverage and fixed cost. That's the formula. And I think you'll expect see that for a long time to come. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. And just to push that home, Heath, we are not at all sensitive to overall sales and marketing leverage or deleverage as a percentage of revenue. We're very much sensitive to channel ROI. But really, the two factors that we look at when we're trying to gauge the health of the business is, how fast is our direct channel growing and that growth really is the biggest driver of our profit growth, and that has been healthy and we're happy about the signs there. And then how much money can we put to work in some of these indirect channels, especially outside of the U.S. because that's a key factor as the new customer acquisition and then moving those new customers into loyalty customers, for example, with Hotels.com or getting those new customers to try out packages on Expedia that really is an opportunity to save that you can't find really any place else. And the more new customers we bring in, to some extent, the worse our sales and marketing leverage is going to look just because of the margins in that part of the business, but that usually is not connected to ROI. We're pretty disciplined about our ROI in these channels and, as a result, we're just driving ROI, and the amount we spend in each channel is, to some extent, unbalanced. We'll spend as much as we can at a certain ROI. The more you spend in the channel, the more difficult it is to drive ROIs that are attractive, and those are the two factors that essentially are going after each other. Operator And we'll go next to Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just one or two. First and foremost, you talked about hotel room nights booked. Great to see that metric grew 18% year-over-year. Is this something we can expect going forward or more like a onetime disclosure, just talking about the booking trends in the quarter? And then, Dara, following up on that last comment, actually around new packages and may be, Mark, to your ancillary revenue comments, there has been talk about the newer format package as more flexible. Can you just help us understand where that is and how sort of meaningful that is in the rollout? And then, lastly, any insight on HomeAway properties on Expedia would be helpful? Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Ron, so just on the hotel room nights booked, it's something that we will periodically disclose when we find it to be helpful to understand what's happening in the business. In this case because Easter was just such a big factor, both for the Core OTA business and particularly for HomeAway, we thought it was relevant to point it out. In normal operating circumstances, those numbers actually look relatively close together. But when they're not, we will call it out when it's helpful. On the packages side, I'll start and then Dara definitely jump in. I think we are at a, I'd say, relatively early stage here. The Brand Expedia team particularly is working on some really interesting ways to dramatically improve the shopping experience when you're shopping for travel, we can  call it, packages but the experience starts to look a lot more just like a multi-item purchase where either during the time of your purchase, you can bundle things together in whatever order you want into almost like a shopping cart experience or increasing what we're seeing as products that we've launched where if you booked a flight, you don't necessarily have to book it at the same time, but you can get a big discount on a hotel or maybe a car rental or an activity. So I think we're relatively early here. The exciting thing is when we look at it, there's really only one player on a global basis that can do these types of things. There are things that, at least our early tests suggest that, consumers really want, and we think that Brand Expedia and the whole Brand Expedia multi-product group including Orbitz and Travelocity and Wotif and CheapTickets and ebookers in that great staple of brands are going to benefit from this for many, many, many years to come. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. The only thing I would add just the key to what Mark said is, with our package path in the past, we would force our users to declare that they're looking for a package upfront, and the fact is that most travelers don't look  a vast majority of our travelers aren't looking for packages upfront. So the key here in our development is allowing users to attach more and more products to the single product that they came into the shop for, so to speak. We are consistently driving up our attach rates. We think there's a lot of upside there. And as we are able to attach more, that allows us to actually pay more for new customers that we find, especially in variable channels and international points-of-sale as well. So it has a double effect, and that obviously it allows us to monetize users more effectively. It allows us to deliver discounts to those users that they can't find pretty much anywhere else on the web and also the more contact that we have with our users, the better. The more relevant that we are, the better, and it allows us to be more aggressive about marketing in the various channels. So we think it's  we're in the middle of the game, and we think there's lots of potential left for us in that area. As far as the HomeAway properties on Expedia, we're up to almost 30,000 properties on the platform, still relatively small compared to the overall HomeAway supply base. And one of the factors there is that the Expedia model is based on commission, and the HomeAway model is based on a combination of commission and traveler service fee, and we are going to be looking to build that flexibility into the Expedia platform, which we think is really going to open up the Expedia, Hotels.com channel into the HomeAway supply as well. So that is going to happen throughout the year. I would say that when you look at this year and the development of HomeAway this year, by far, the number one priority for us is pushing HomeAway and developing that trend  that transition from an advertising platform to a global transactional platform. We think the upside there is absolutely enormous. And, by far, the number one priority is HomeAway on a standalone basis. The HomeAway supply on Expedia, Hotels.com is considerable long-term upside, but it's priority number two at this point. Operator We'll go next to Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Company. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC Hi. Thanks a lot. I just had a follow-up on HomeAway. When you look at night stayed there at plus 12% in Q1 versus nights booked at plus 39%, it was a pretty dramatic recovery. Could you just go over the top key factors again that you saw over Q4 and Q1 in that business that drove the acceleration? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Thanks, Kevin. Well, Easter was a factor, but by far, the biggest factor is a lengthening in the booking window that we're seeing with HomeAway, and it really goes to, we believe anyways, one of the factors that Dara called out. The early adopters on online bookability were predominantly some of the larger property managers. And as we have rolled out online bookability throughout a broader selection of properties, what we've actually seen is an increase in the value per booking, which suggests to us that there's a mix shift into some of these larger bigger tickets, whole-home unique properties and those types of properties generally need to be booked much further in advance. So we're definitely seeing a lengthening of the booking window. We think that could be a driver. We haven't nailed down all of the specifics of what could be causing it, but that's by far the most obvious one that we can see at this point. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Great. And then just to follow-up on that, how far along do you think you are in the process of kind of making sure all of the business that you're originating is [] transacted online to the platform? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Well, I'd say we've got a ways to go on that. It's a big opportunity still. We know that there are transactions that are happening off-platform, and the team is really focused on really developing reasons why both on the traveler side and on the property owner side or property manager side, reasons for people to stick with the platform. You've seen it on the consumer side where they've introduced the Book with Confidence Guarantee increasingly. You'll see HomeAway willing to step in front of a traveler, and if they've got a bad experience, help them move to a new property or help solve their problem. They are working on various series of, what I'd call, carrots and sticks on the owner and the supplier side to incent the right behavior and put more bookings on the platform. They're early on that side. They've got a number of supplier-facing data and tools that they're building out dashboarding, et cetera. As Dara mentioned, they're experimenting with sort, and these are the types of factors around on-platform versus off-platform that can start to influence sort order. And there's a number of other, call it, goodies that HomeAway is looking at rolling out across the platform to incent the right behavior. So it's relatively early. It's a really high priority for that team, and we're very optimistic that they're going to be able to increasingly just drive much more on-platform adoption because it's going to be something that both travelers and suppliers want to do. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Yes, I think we're going to make it considerably more attractive, especially for our homeowners and property managers to stay on platform, so there are some pretty exciting products coming out there, so stay tuned. Operator And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Jim Shaughnessy - RBC Capital Markets LLC Good afternoon. Thanks, guys. This is Jim Shaughnessy stepping in for Mark. Just a quick question on international booking trends. I think on the last call, you mentioned that you expect trends to improve throughout 2017, and it looks like they have. So maybe building off a prior question, why don't you drill down a little bit on which markets you think are performing particularly well and continue in 2017? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Yes, I mean, I think we're seeing a broad pick-up across the region. Brand Expedia, particularly, has seen some nice growth in Europe. They rolled out some new features in the air side of the business that's been driving some really solid results. We've seen strong results in various parts of Asia. Hotels.com is having a blockbuster year so far in South Korea, posting pretty impressive results, and Latin America generally is good. Mexico has been pretty strongly really for across our brands. I'd also say that one of the things to keep in mind when you're looking at international booking trends is that we will start to see some improvement further in the back half of the year as we lap over the ebookers transition, and that's actually a headwind on bookings. And because it was a business that had a fair bit of air in it, it has a disproportionate impact on gross bookings. But I'd say, generally Asia, Latin America and Europe are strengths with the countries I mentioned. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. And Paris is coming back now, is recovering from obviously the negative numbers that we saw last year. So Paris is growing for us, which is great to see. That city certainly needs a business. And London as a destination for us is very, very strong, which we think has to do with the British pound. Once the British pound went down, London as a destination became  the numbers there were pretty darn attractive, and they continue as we speak. Operator We'll go next to Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hey, good afternoon. I guess you may have answered some portion of the question, but tell us what percent of HomeAway properties or transactions are now capturing the traveler bookings, or do you expect to keep that at 100% of properties or will there always be some subset that don't capture the booking fees? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Well, the general way to think about it is when properties are online bookable, so the 1.4 million properties we have that are online bookable, they are all fee-able and are generally all being applied a traveler fee to it on the HomeAway platform. There will be some that are on the Brand Expedia platform, for example, which currently don't have a fee attached to them. But generally, on HomeAway, everything that's online, think about that as traveler fee-able. There are still some transactions though that are happening offline, which we don't have great visibility into, and that's where you'd call there be leakage, if you will, but that's really isolated to the offline business. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. And then you talked about buying back 450,000 shares so far this year. Is it your goal to somewhat offset stock comp dilution or is the goal longer-term to actually shrink the share count over time through your buyback activity or do you kind of want to focus on keeping dry powder for acquisitions? Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Well, I'd say it's the same strategy as we've always had. If you look back over history, we have shrunk our share count over time, and we're big believers in this business, and I would look at our past behavior as an indication of what we will likely do in the future. But that's not the case always from quarter-to-quarter, and it's not always the case from year-to-year. And we certainly take into account the M&A pipeline and what we're thinking about doing on that side. We look at our dividend, and then share repurchase is something that we do look at. We always have an eye to dilution, but it's not formulaic. It's not the driver and we do think that part of our capital allocation strategy will include share repurchases over the next number of years. Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc. Next question, please. Operator We'll go next to Mark May with Citi. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it. Hopefully, these weren't taken already. But in terms of Core OTA margins, could you provide any color in terms of how much of the modest decline year-on-year was attributable to investments in, say, new markets, new growth initiatives versus kind of investing and doubling down, if you will, in some of your core markets? And if you could provide, if you haven't already, a progress update in terms of where you are in terms of leveraging the HomeAway inventory across the Expedia brands. And what, if any, impact that that is having either in Q1 or you expect to have this year in terms of room night growth. Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Mark, the real driver on margins for the quarter was the shift of Easter to the second quarter. That, I'd call that number one, and no real other significant drivers I'd call out. It's really sort of business as usual for us, and we're happy with the margin profile that we see. And I think in Q2, you'll probably see the offset there of what happened in the first quarter. Dara, you want to talk about HomeAway? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Mark, on the HomeAway inventory, we talked about it some earlier. It's very early. Right now the production of HomeAway inventory on Expedia brands is pretty small. And we would expect to see that increase significantly as the year goes on and especially into next year. The priority for the HomeAway teams at this point is to make sure that the transition to online transactions go smoothly, make sure that the experience, the traveler experience and the homeowner experience is as good as it can be, and that's really what we're focused on at this point. Operator We'll go next to Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thank you very much. First on Egencia, Dara, you alluded to the business hitting an inflection point. Could you discuss what changed and just remind us whether the sales force investment was in the initial plan for the year or if it does something you've decided that lean into and invest a bit more in? And then, secondly, on HomeAway, could you walk through just what differences you see between conversion on instantly bookable and online bookable today, and then what levers you have to move back more toward instant bookable over time? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Sure. As far as Egencia hitting an inflection point, Egencia has been  the team has been hard at work in a number of integrations over the past three years via integration, Orbitz for business integrations, the Orbitz business integration really, really going well. And those integrations always take time, and they take focus, and they cost money. And at the same time, the team has been investing in the core systems of the business to globalize them or to modernize the technology stack, really in the same way that we've been consistently doing with Expedia, Hotels.com, et cetera. Egencia has been a little later in coming just because of all the integrations that the team has been driving, but we feel like we're in a really good spot where the team is starting to deliver just excellent innovation on the product side. The sale, the response to our sales pictures, et cetera, has been very attractive, and we just continue to gain share in the core travel marketplace. We think that we are competing against a set of competitors who has fundamentally not made the shift online, has fundamentally not made the shift to agile technology, and we think this is the time for it to double down. So seeing the very strong results in the first quarter, we were already planning to invest in the Egencia sales team, but the pattern for our company overall Expedia, Inc. is, when we see some strength, we like to lean into that strength. And with Egencia, we're seeing strength, we're leaning into that strength, and it will be safe to assume that the sales plan and the sales hiring plan for Egencia is higher today than where we started a year from and that's a great thing. As far as HomeAway, the differences in conversion, we're not going to disclose specific differences, but it's safe to assume that online bookable properties convert and produce at better rates  sorry, instant bookable properties produce at stronger rates than simply online bookable properties. Right now, the focus is moving the folks to online bookable, and we will quickly shift to getting as much of them instant bookable as possible. Operator We'll go next to Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates Thank you. Kind of following up on some of the things you suggested. Interested in your thoughts on if you see some major disruptive technology on the horizon and if so, where so and when so? And does it involve AI or what it may involve? And sort of unrelated to that, can you talk about what you're seeing in timeshare business as competitive for HomeAway and for maybe some of the related type of companies? Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. I think AI is a good deal down the road. I think, right now, we are more dependent on OI, organic intelligence, here of folks here at the company. I think as far as disruptive technology, I do like to talk about the 3Ms, and it's not disruptive. It's just happening. One is mobile for us. And right now with most brands, over a-third of our transactions are mobile. Over half of our traffic is mobile. And the cool thing about mobile is it's always on, and it gives you location context. The second M for us that's emerging, especially in the APAC markets are messaging. And what messaging does for us is, it allows two-way communication at any time, but it also combines identity with our communication. And once you have identity, you can start communicating with someone on a one-to-one basis. Most of our systems right now are built to serve the average. Basically as a consumer when you come to Expedia, most of our systems are built to serve the average consumer. Now more and more we can optimize to the specific customer. And you combine that with a third M, which is machine learning, it is only possible to optimize to the individual based on very significant amounts of data, very significant amounts of interaction, so that you can start treating every single customer in a different way. You can go back to the olden days, when you're travel agent knew exactly what you wanted. This is going to be disruptive, but it's going to be a slow disruption as we learn more and more about you, as you tell us more and more about you through your behavior and otherwise give us more data, but we think that, that personal one-to-one connection is something that's coming over a period of time. And we think that because we have so many opportunities to interact with a customer we are  and also because we are investing significantly in technology, in product, in user interaction, I think, that we are one of the best positioned companies in travel to take advantage of it. So call it a slow disruption, but it is absolutely coming. As far as the timeshare business as it relates to HomeAway, I think the timeshare companies and timeshare owners probably are participants in the HomeAway marketplace, but I can't say that it's something that we talk about on a significant basis in the HomeAway haul. So I'm sure they're part of the marketplace, but at this point, it's not a significant portion of our strategy. Operator We'll go next to Perry Gold with MoffettNathanson. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Two please, if I may. Is there any other color you can provide on the overall performance at your OTA brand other than Orbitz? And then also the step-up at inter-company eliminations, does that just have to do with Expedia's brand taking more share on trivago or driving more traffic through trivago relative to other channels? Thanks so much. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Sure. I'll take those, Perry. But just take the second one first. The answer is yes. That is largely due to our brands, so it could be Brand Expedia, Hotels.com taking share in the trivago channel and doing very well there. Super attractive channel right now in the market, generally just because it's growing so quickly and our brands are performing well, and we're very happy with the performance there, so it shows up in that number. In terms of overall performance at the core OTA brands, I think Brand Expedia is doing very well right now. It's great to have that team refocused on the core business and not so focused on integrations. They did a phenomenal job of those integrations. But as we all know, they did take a toll on the results, but that team is right back to business as usual. They're thrilled to be back to business as usual, and they're thrilled with the opportunity ahead of them, and they're going after it, and the results are starting to show up. We're pleased with what we're seeing at Hotels.com as well. That team has been executing very well for a long period of time. They've got a great rewards program, and they continue to press on that. Their international growth, I mentioned South Korea is impressive, and they just continue to execute on their formula around the world. And then I'd also call out our private label business, the Expedia Affiliate Network business, who had a really good year last year and is just on a really solid footing this year, just exceptional results really powering the whole industry, offline travel agencies, corporate travel players, other online travel agencies, airlines, all with our world-class agency and merchant hotel inventory. And I'd just say the team is executing very well there, and we're very excited about what that team can do. Operator We'll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question. I think in a number of industry forums it's come up recently that paid marketing channels might actually be increasing their importance in terms of the way consumers are finding travel brands, planning their travel, you obviously have a play on that with trivago, but I don't know, if either Dara or Mark, if you would like to talk about the importance of the paid marketing channels, how relative ROIs might be evolving at some of those channels versus what you can do brand building and trying to drive more direct traffic over time and maybe lowering your overall ROI over time. Thanks, guys. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Sure, Eric. In general, listen, I think it's accurate to say that the paid channels are growing their audience share in terms of travel spend, and the fastest share growth is coming from the meta channels, and the fastest share grower in the meta channels is trivago. That team is really executing on a world-class basis, and trivago I think as far as audience share as far as the channel goes, probably the fastest-growing scaled channel there is in terms of audience. And that's a great thing. And as it relates to our relationship with these paid channels, I think, in general, the OTAs are consistently investing in conversion, in user experience and in data science that allows us to get call it a higher share of those paid channels than the other players out there. So while from a profitability margin basis, the increase in growth of those paid channels hurts our margin, we talked a little bit about our sales and marketing margin as a percentage of revenue. From a share standpoint, it is unquestionably a positive for us, and it's a bigger positive because trivago is a part of the family. We're very strict on ROIs and in general, ROIs for us look stable, and they look good, and we view the paid channels as very significant means for us to gain share and a significant means for us to go acquire new customers, especially in international markets. And then, if we provide them for  if we provide those customers a great experience, again and again, we see that a certain percentage of those customers move over to repeat customers and stay with us and come direct. And when you look at the profit dollars that are coming into, call it, the big two OTAs, you can certainly see that the profit dollars and the profit dollar growth there is quite healthy on a global basis. And at this point, I don't see anything that would change that. Operator And we'll go next to Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Seth Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thanks for the question. This is Seth on for Lloyd. I was wondering if you could provide any additional color as to how HomeAway contributed to room night growth in the quarter and what the core room night year-over-year was, as it seems to slowed even given the ex-Easter and leap year impact? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Yeah. So HomeAway's standalone stayed room night growth was right in line with the rest of the business. So it didn't have an impact. It did help the books room night metric that we gave you. But I think also just keep in mind that the other number we gave is just around the global brands, which grew about 17% year-over-year on a stayed basis. So HomeAway was a factor, but it didn't change the story at all for us. Next question please? Operator That is all the time we have questions for today. So I'll hand the call back over for Alan Pickerill for any additional or closing remarks. Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc. Great job. Thanks everybody for joining us today. We appreciate it. Dara, any closing remarks? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Just thank you to our team on a global basis. We're off to a good start, and let's keep it that way. Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Thank you. Operator That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator We'll go first to Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Yes. Hi. Thank you very much. Just on  two quick questions. So first, on HomeAway, Dara, can you talk about the conversion rates on the instantly bookable properties, what kind of trend you have seen to date and what should we expect going forward, given that you are willing to spend so much on the variable channels? And then I have a follow-up. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Sure. In general, we are seeing overall conversion rates at HomeAway continue to increase on a year-on-year basis and continuing to increase at healthy rates. So when you look at the booking trends, which are strong and positive, it's a combination of traffic to HomeAway increasing on a year-on-year basis. It's double digits. We're being hurt by SEO but certainly being helped by other traffic sources, including the investment that we're making in the variable channels. And then the team is optimizing around booking conversion, and booking conversion is up at healthy rates on a year-on-year basis, although we feel that we have a long way to go. In general, the move towards what we're trying to make are two moves. One is from offline to online bookable, and we have over 85% of our properties now online bookable. And then we're also making the transition over from online bookable to instant bookable. That's still earlier and we think that the move to instant booking will continue to be a tailwind as it relates to overall conversion rates. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay. And then just sort of drilling a little bit into the  into your response, so what should we expect about your ability to tweak the best sort for the remain- as we look into the remainder of the year? So I guess, with the ungrandfathering of the subscriptions, you would probably have more flexibility to do that. What would be the cadence of your tweak to the thing? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Yeah. I'd say the cadence is unpredictable. These are  we're putting in sort changes on a daily, weekly basis. You are right to conclude that as the paid tier subscription or the higher tier subscriptions roll off, we have greater room for optimization. And we think we're very, very early in the overall optimization. So the sort teams continue to roll out new algorithms and, in general, the algorithms are getting better and better. And this is really before we put machine learning into play as well. These are, call it, more static algorithms that are being optimized, and I think machine learning can take this to a different level. And we're really one year in here. So we got a long, long way to go. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. And Naved, as a reminder, that tiered subscriptions will completely become a non-issue starting in July of this year. So at that point, we've got complete freedom, but as Dara said, there's lots of tests already going on. Operator We'll go next to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks very much for the question. A couple, if I could. Last quarter, you talked about improving the homeowner dashboard control to help property owners better understand the algorithms. Wondering if any of those improvements have rolled out yet and if so, what the feedback has been. And then secondly, wondering if you could give us any color on Orbitz? Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Sure. As far as the owner dashboard, we have  there's been a significant amount of development going into the owner dashboard. In general, we want to arm up the owners with significantly more data, both in terms of their earning power, in terms of the kinds of folks looking at their properties and really how they can capture more share within our marketplace. I would expect some pretty significant releases over the year. I think we're pretty early. We've introduced some better calendar management, for example. We've optimized the traveler app for the checkout experiences. We've launched House Rules that inform travelers of what's expected of them before they book, but I think these are really the basics, and we're just getting started here. I do think we can do a better job, in general, in explaining to owners what they can and should be doing to improve their sorts. One of the significant factors is content, the quality of content as far as pictures goes, the quality of content as far as what to expect when you get into the home and, obviously, reviews. And I do think that this is an area that when we talk to our owners, we get some feedback that we can be doing better, and the HomeAway team is certainly focused on making sure owners understand exactly why they are getting the demand that they're getting and how they can optimize and improve their demand inside the marketplace. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. And then, Peter, in terms of Orbitz, I'd say generally, we're pretty pleased with the way that the  what was the old Orbitz and is now part of Expedia, Inc. is performing. In terms of just some specifics on that, from a top-line perspective, the business is still declining and, call it, the mid-teens range. As a reminder, the reason for this is there's a number of formerly Orbitz Partner Network customers that we didn't migrate over, a number of points of sale for e-workers that we didn't migrate over, some Orbitz for Business customers that we didn't migrate over. But if you back out the impact of that, the core of the business looks good. The conversion rates we're seeing on hotel looks solid and of course, the cost synergies that we really brought in to fruition through 2016 are there in full force. So we're happy with what we see. We are still optimizing the Orbitz businesses and getting that right marketing formula in place to optimize for profit margin and of course, profit margin in these businesses looks absolutely excellent. Next question, please? Operator We'll go next to Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Should we expect HomeAway online gross bookings to follow similar seasonal trends as last year or as you are able to pivot the business to a more transactional model, should we expect a more smooth seasonal pattern? And then additionally for HomeAway, can you provide a breakdown between traveler fee or transactional revenue versus subscription and other? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Sure. I'll answer the first, Jed. We are getting used to HomeAway booking patterns and stay patterns at this point. So we can't answer your question with absolute certainty. It actually looks to us like the seasonal stay patterns are going to become more pronounced. What we're seeing is that the early entrants into the HomeAway marketplace or property managers who might have had more apartments kind of the professionally managed concept apartments. We're seeing the average dollar value per property booking with HomeAway move up, which means that the bigger homes are coming online, and the demand is moving over to the bigger homes. Those larger homes tend to be more seasonal in nature, so we would actually expect to see a higher percentage of dollar stays if for HomeAway concentrated in Q3 than what you saw last year. Mark, you want to answer the HomeAway traveler fee versus transactional revenue? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Yes, sure. Yeah. So we're not going to give the quarterly number but just as a reminder, what we said was that by the end of 2017 here, we'd be at about 25% subscription and no change. We're really on track to turn that way. Operator We'll go next to Ross Sandler with Barclays. Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. This is Deepak on for Ross. Can you talk about the levels of marketing spend that are going into different components between the OTA brands and HomeAway this year? I think HomeAway was expected to ramp. And then given the several quarters we are into the integration, are the practices that are employed typically in Expedia to optimize for conversions currently put into place in HomeAway at this stage? How do you view their efficiency of marketing programs? I have one more follow-up after that. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Yeah. I think on the second question, most definitely, the CEO of HomeAway is John Kim, and John was the Head of Product at Expedia. So you can imagine that we have taken a number of Expedia practices and we have combined them with HomeAway practices that come up with, call it, the best-of-breed both in terms of design and in product and in technology as well. So, the HomeAway team is driving a lot more experimentation, significantly more A/B testing and the pace of change and testing on that site now is  while it's not up to, call it, Expedia or Hotels.com standards, it has significantly accelerated versus where they were a year ago, and I anticipate it's going to significantly accelerate going into next year, which is going to help conversion rates and is also going to help our ability to market into variable channels. We have moved over talent from online marketing from Hotels.com to HomeAway as well. So there's a bunch of talent moving over. The trends in terms of conversion are good. It's translating into higher online marketing numbers, and it's safe to assume that the HomeAway marketing spend on a year-on-year basis, the increase is higher than the year-on-year increases that you see in our Core OTA. Anything to add there, Mark? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Yeah. I mean, I'd say, I'd put some numbers on it. I think our direct sales and marketing for HomeAway up north of 50% in the first quarter. We will start to see those decelerate, though, as we move through the year, because we're going to lap particularly in the back half of the year the aggressive ramp-up in sales and marketing. That's not in a spot where it's totally moving the needle on our overall sales and marketing numbers yet, although it is a factor. And to your other point around where we're putting dollars across the Core OTA brands, we're really putting money in behind Brand Expedia. We're putting it in behind Hotels.com. Egencia is a driver as well, other segment for us. And when you look at the bulk of our direct sales and marketing spend, which is growing 25% in the quarter, I think about the growth rate in sales and marketing in the Core OTA segment as being pretty close to that, because that's really where it's going. It's going to the big global brands. Operator We'll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. There Doug? Operator Douglas, your line is open. Please check your mute function. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Let's try someone else and maybe Doug will come back. Operator We'll go next to Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC Thanks guys. As you look at the inventory additions this quarter, can you give us any color of the mix overall, hotels versus non-traditional? I guess what I'm getting at is, are you happy with your overall inventory mix, maybe across geographies? Are you happy with the way you're adding non-traditional and hotels? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Yeah. I'd say we're happy, but we think we have a long way to go. The inventory now is at about 385,000 hotels. We are early in the integration of the HomeAway inventory into the mainline OTA inventory. So we're just getting started there, and we have a long way to go. And we think that the pace of inventory addition, I think, we've added, it's up about 36% on a year-on-year basis as far as inventory goes. That kind of a pace is going to continue. It's not going to be consistent every single quarter, but that kind of a base is certainly going to continue. The new hotels continue to perform well within our marketplace. They represent an opportunity for us to spend more marketing dollars as well as to increase conversion on a destination basis as well, and it's just part of the formula right now. It's higher conversion, the higher conversion driving more marketing both online and offline. The more marketing allowing us the ability to add more supply into the marketplace and all of that increasing customer loyalty, which is really the formula that we've had for a long time, and you've got to optimize each portion of that formula a little bit in order to improve. And of course, you have to improve more than the overall market because the market is certainly improving as well. So I think we are in the early middle portion of the game, and we're quite optimistic about the opportunities here over the next 3 to 5 years. Operator We'll go next to Akshay Bhatia with Bank of America. Akshay Bhatia - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. Hi. Thanks for the question. When we look at the Core OTA take rate, looks pretty stable year-over-year. Could you talk about some of the puts and takes, specifically touching on maybe the mix of agency, hotel accelerator, and then maybe some of the negotiations you guys are having with hotel brands? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Yeah. So I think the story is similar to what we've seen for a while. I think on the hotel side, there still is a little bit of a headwind on margin, although that's significantly less than what it's been in the past. That's essentially offset by a couple of factors. One is, we do continue to see a mix shift of the business towards hotel, which is generally going faster than our air business. Secondly, we've seen nice results from ancillary revenues and media revenues that are also buttressing those take rates, and all of those sort of net out to something that's relatively stable. And I think we're happy with generally where we are, and we're particularly happy with some of these ancillary revenue streams in the Core OTA business, like insurance, like our activities business that are performing nicely. Akshay Bhatia - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator We'll go next to Paul Bieber with Credit Suisse. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thanks for taking my questions. First off, how should we think about the room night growth trajectory during the summer booking season for both domestic and international, given the deceleration and especially domestic in the reported numbers? And then just generally, how would you characterize the macro backdrop for travel in the U.S., Europe, and APAC? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Sure. So in terms of room night growth, I'd just remind you that the Easter impact was significant here in the first quarter. We were actually quite happy with what we saw in terms of room night growth and generally pointed to stable to faster in the first quarter on the normalized numbers that we look at. A few things to keep in mind, though, as we move into Q2 and Q3, one is, Easter will be a helper for us in Q2 from a reported basis, and then our comps do start to get easier as we move into Q2, and again, the easiest comp is probably into Q3, so a few things to keep in mind on that front. In terms of the macro landscape in Europe and otherwise, I think largely similar. I think the London attack for us, we could certainly see impact to London but it's hard to tease that out completely from Easter. And our expectation, thing would be to get back to business as usual is that's what we've seen generally with other regions. The elections in France didn't cause too much of a stir for us. The macro backdrop in Europe seems to be reasonably healthy. When we look at the U.S., again, similar stories. Things seem to be reasonably healthy. We have seen a little bit of a slowdown in travel from the Middle East into the U.S. and a few cross-regional patterns like that, but, net-net, from where we see, looks like a healthy market to us. Operator We'll go next to Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks. I was just wondering if you could give us a bit of a sense of strategically how you're thinking about the trade-off between sales and marketing leverage and revenue growth. Obviously, you've got the targets out there for EBITDA, but to the extent that we saw the roughly 344 basis points of deleverage in sales and marketing this year or this quarter, can you give us a sense of what you're trying to get or what you think you'll get out of that kind of spend from a revenue growth perspective and where as a company you're happy with that revenue growth being? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Thanks, Heath. I guess, just one note for you in terms of sales and marketing leverage this quarter. This is always a tough quarter for us from a sales and marketing deleverage standpoint, and primary reason is that we're spending sales and marketing essentially against bookings, not against stayed revenues so there's a little bit of a mismatch. That's accentuated this quarter by the fact that we had Easter also shift which, of course, is an impact revenue and nothing to sales and marketing. I'd say, generally, our strategy, though, as it relates to sales and marketing, has not changed. I mean, we are really looking to drive bottom-line adjusted EBITDA dollar growth and, to that end, really, we're looking to spend to drive more volume, get new customers into the platform, have them get a great experience and have them come back to us through the direct channels like apps, like e-mail, et cetera, and the formula is working. And so, most of what you see when you see sales and marketing de-levered with us is largely as a result of mix drivers. It's the fact that we're spending more aggressively and the region is getting bigger, Asia Pacific, for example, than we are in the U.S. and, though even Asia  even though Asia is less efficient from a sales and marketing perspective than the U.S., that's what's driving the mix, and Asia itself is getting more efficient over time. We also see channel shifts in our sales and marketing expense as we drive conversion. It allows us to spend more into variable marketing channels. Again, the direct channels, the chief channels still look very healthy, and they're growing nicely, but essentially we're able to buy more in these variable channels, and that's a factor for us as well. So I think you'll see the same strategy for us. We like to invest aggressively in sales and marketing. We like to fund that with leverage and fixed cost. That's the formula. And I think you'll expect see that for a long time to come. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. And just to push that home, Heath, we are not at all sensitive to overall sales and marketing leverage or deleverage as a percentage of revenue. We're very much sensitive to channel ROI. But really, the two factors that we look at when we're trying to gauge the health of the business is, how fast is our direct channel growing and that growth really is the biggest driver of our profit growth, and that has been healthy and we're happy about the signs there. And then how much money can we put to work in some of these indirect channels, especially outside of the U.S. because that's a key factor as the new customer acquisition and then moving those new customers into loyalty customers, for example, with Hotels.com or getting those new customers to try out packages on Expedia that really is an opportunity to save that you can't find really any place else. And the more new customers we bring in, to some extent, the worse our sales and marketing leverage is going to look just because of the margins in that part of the business, but that usually is not connected to ROI. We're pretty disciplined about our ROI in these channels and, as a result, we're just driving ROI, and the amount we spend in each channel is, to some extent, unbalanced. We'll spend as much as we can at a certain ROI. The more you spend in the channel, the more difficult it is to drive ROIs that are attractive, and those are the two factors that essentially are going after each other. Operator And we'll go next to Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just one or two. First and foremost, you talked about hotel room nights booked. Great to see that metric grew 18% year-over-year. Is this something we can expect going forward or more like a onetime disclosure, just talking about the booking trends in the quarter? And then, Dara, following up on that last comment, actually around new packages and may be, Mark, to your ancillary revenue comments, there has been talk about the newer format package as more flexible. Can you just help us understand where that is and how sort of meaningful that is in the rollout? And then, lastly, any insight on HomeAway properties on Expedia would be helpful? Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Ron, so just on the hotel room nights booked, it's something that we will periodically disclose when we find it to be helpful to understand what's happening in the business. In this case because Easter was just such a big factor, both for the Core OTA business and particularly for HomeAway, we thought it was relevant to point it out. In normal operating circumstances, those numbers actually look relatively close together. But when they're not, we will call it out when it's helpful. On the packages side, I'll start and then Dara definitely jump in. I think we are at a, I'd say, relatively early stage here. The Brand Expedia team particularly is working on some really interesting ways to dramatically improve the shopping experience when you're shopping for travel, we can  call it, packages but the experience starts to look a lot more just like a multi-item purchase where either during the time of your purchase, you can bundle things together in whatever order you want into almost like a shopping cart experience or increasing what we're seeing as products that we've launched where if you booked a flight, you don't necessarily have to book it at the same time, but you can get a big discount on a hotel or maybe a car rental or an activity. So I think we're relatively early here. The exciting thing is when we look at it, there's really only one player on a global basis that can do these types of things. There are things that, at least our early tests suggest that, consumers really want, and we think that Brand Expedia and the whole Brand Expedia multi-product group including Orbitz and Travelocity and Wotif and CheapTickets and ebookers in that great staple of brands are going to benefit from this for many, many, many years to come. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. The only thing I would add just the key to what Mark said is, with our package path in the past, we would force our users to declare that they're looking for a package upfront, and the fact is that most travelers don't look  a vast majority of our travelers aren't looking for packages upfront. So the key here in our development is allowing users to attach more and more products to the single product that they came into the shop for, so to speak. We are consistently driving up our attach rates. We think there's a lot of upside there. And as we are able to attach more, that allows us to actually pay more for new customers that we find, especially in variable channels and international points-of-sale as well. So it has a double effect, and that obviously it allows us to monetize users more effectively. It allows us to deliver discounts to those users that they can't find pretty much anywhere else on the web and also the more contact that we have with our users, the better. The more relevant that we are, the better, and it allows us to be more aggressive about marketing in the various channels. So we think it's  we're in the middle of the game, and we think there's lots of potential left for us in that area. As far as the HomeAway properties on Expedia, we're up to almost 30,000 properties on the platform, still relatively small compared to the overall HomeAway supply base. And one of the factors there is that the Expedia model is based on commission, and the HomeAway model is based on a combination of commission and traveler service fee, and we are going to be looking to build that flexibility into the Expedia platform, which we think is really going to open up the Expedia, Hotels.com channel into the HomeAway supply as well. So that is going to happen throughout the year. I would say that when you look at this year and the development of HomeAway this year, by far, the number one priority for us is pushing HomeAway and developing that trend  that transition from an advertising platform to a global transactional platform. We think the upside there is absolutely enormous. And, by far, the number one priority is HomeAway on a standalone basis. The HomeAway supply on Expedia, Hotels.com is considerable long-term upside, but it's priority number two at this point. Operator We'll go next to Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Company. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC Hi. Thanks a lot. I just had a follow-up on HomeAway. When you look at night stayed there at plus 12% in Q1 versus nights booked at plus 39%, it was a pretty dramatic recovery. Could you just go over the top key factors again that you saw over Q4 and Q1 in that business that drove the acceleration? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Thanks, Kevin. Well, Easter was a factor, but by far, the biggest factor is a lengthening in the booking window that we're seeing with HomeAway, and it really goes to, we believe anyways, one of the factors that Dara called out. The early adopters on online bookability were predominantly some of the larger property managers. And as we have rolled out online bookability throughout a broader selection of properties, what we've actually seen is an increase in the value per booking, which suggests to us that there's a mix shift into some of these larger bigger tickets, whole-home unique properties and those types of properties generally need to be booked much further in advance. So we're definitely seeing a lengthening of the booking window. We think that could be a driver. We haven't nailed down all of the specifics of what could be causing it, but that's by far the most obvious one that we can see at this point. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Great. And then just to follow-up on that, how far along do you think you are in the process of kind of making sure all of the business that you're originating is [] transacted online to the platform? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Well, I'd say we've got a ways to go on that. It's a big opportunity still. We know that there are transactions that are happening off-platform, and the team is really focused on really developing reasons why both on the traveler side and on the property owner side or property manager side, reasons for people to stick with the platform. You've seen it on the consumer side where they've introduced the Book with Confidence Guarantee increasingly. You'll see HomeAway willing to step in front of a traveler, and if they've got a bad experience, help them move to a new property or help solve their problem. They are working on various series of, what I'd call, carrots and sticks on the owner and the supplier side to incent the right behavior and put more bookings on the platform. They're early on that side. They've got a number of supplier-facing data and tools that they're building out dashboarding, et cetera. As Dara mentioned, they're experimenting with sort, and these are the types of factors around on-platform versus off-platform that can start to influence sort order. And there's a number of other, call it, goodies that HomeAway is looking at rolling out across the platform to incent the right behavior. So it's relatively early. It's a really high priority for that team, and we're very optimistic that they're going to be able to increasingly just drive much more on-platform adoption because it's going to be something that both travelers and suppliers want to do. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Yes, I think we're going to make it considerably more attractive, especially for our homeowners and property managers to stay on platform, so there are some pretty exciting products coming out there, so stay tuned. Operator And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Jim Shaughnessy - RBC Capital Markets LLC Good afternoon. Thanks, guys. This is Jim Shaughnessy stepping in for Mark. Just a quick question on international booking trends. I think on the last call, you mentioned that you expect trends to improve throughout 2017, and it looks like they have. So maybe building off a prior question, why don't you drill down a little bit on which markets you think are performing particularly well and continue in 2017? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Yes, I mean, I think we're seeing a broad pick-up across the region. Brand Expedia, particularly, has seen some nice growth in Europe. They rolled out some new features in the air side of the business that's been driving some really solid results. We've seen strong results in various parts of Asia. Hotels.com is having a blockbuster year so far in South Korea, posting pretty impressive results, and Latin America generally is good. Mexico has been pretty strongly really for across our brands. I'd also say that one of the things to keep in mind when you're looking at international booking trends is that we will start to see some improvement further in the back half of the year as we lap over the ebookers transition, and that's actually a headwind on bookings. And because it was a business that had a fair bit of air in it, it has a disproportionate impact on gross bookings. But I'd say, generally Asia, Latin America and Europe are strengths with the countries I mentioned. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. And Paris is coming back now, is recovering from obviously the negative numbers that we saw last year. So Paris is growing for us, which is great to see. That city certainly needs a business. And London as a destination for us is very, very strong, which we think has to do with the British pound. Once the British pound went down, London as a destination became  the numbers there were pretty darn attractive, and they continue as we speak. Operator We'll go next to Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hey, good afternoon. I guess you may have answered some portion of the question, but tell us what percent of HomeAway properties or transactions are now capturing the traveler bookings, or do you expect to keep that at 100% of properties or will there always be some subset that don't capture the booking fees? Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Well, the general way to think about it is when properties are online bookable, so the 1.4 million properties we have that are online bookable, they are all fee-able and are generally all being applied a traveler fee to it on the HomeAway platform. There will be some that are on the Brand Expedia platform, for example, which currently don't have a fee attached to them. But generally, on HomeAway, everything that's online, think about that as traveler fee-able. There are still some transactions though that are happening offline, which we don't have great visibility into, and that's where you'd call there be leakage, if you will, but that's really isolated to the offline business. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. And then you talked about buying back 450,000 shares so far this year. Is it your goal to somewhat offset stock comp dilution or is the goal longer-term to actually shrink the share count over time through your buyback activity or do you kind of want to focus on keeping dry powder for acquisitions? Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Well, I'd say it's the same strategy as we've always had. If you look back over history, we have shrunk our share count over time, and we're big believers in this business, and I would look at our past behavior as an indication of what we will likely do in the future. But that's not the case always from quarter-to-quarter, and it's not always the case from year-to-year. And we certainly take into account the M&A pipeline and what we're thinking about doing on that side. We look at our dividend, and then share repurchase is something that we do look at. We always have an eye to dilution, but it's not formulaic. It's not the driver and we do think that part of our capital allocation strategy will include share repurchases over the next number of years. Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc. Next question, please. Operator We'll go next to Mark May with Citi. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it. Hopefully, these weren't taken already. But in terms of Core OTA margins, could you provide any color in terms of how much of the modest decline year-on-year was attributable to investments in, say, new markets, new growth initiatives versus kind of investing and doubling down, if you will, in some of your core markets? And if you could provide, if you haven't already, a progress update in terms of where you are in terms of leveraging the HomeAway inventory across the Expedia brands. And what, if any, impact that that is having either in Q1 or you expect to have this year in terms of room night growth. Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Mark, the real driver on margins for the quarter was the shift of Easter to the second quarter. That, I'd call that number one, and no real other significant drivers I'd call out. It's really sort of business as usual for us, and we're happy with the margin profile that we see. And I think in Q2, you'll probably see the offset there of what happened in the first quarter. Dara, you want to talk about HomeAway? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Mark, on the HomeAway inventory, we talked about it some earlier. It's very early. Right now the production of HomeAway inventory on Expedia brands is pretty small. And we would expect to see that increase significantly as the year goes on and especially into next year. The priority for the HomeAway teams at this point is to make sure that the transition to online transactions go smoothly, make sure that the experience, the traveler experience and the homeowner experience is as good as it can be, and that's really what we're focused on at this point. Operator We'll go next to Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thank you very much. First on Egencia, Dara, you alluded to the business hitting an inflection point. Could you discuss what changed and just remind us whether the sales force investment was in the initial plan for the year or if it does something you've decided that lean into and invest a bit more in? And then, secondly, on HomeAway, could you walk through just what differences you see between conversion on instantly bookable and online bookable today, and then what levers you have to move back more toward instant bookable over time? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Sure. As far as Egencia hitting an inflection point, Egencia has been  the team has been hard at work in a number of integrations over the past three years via integration, Orbitz for business integrations, the Orbitz business integration really, really going well. And those integrations always take time, and they take focus, and they cost money. And at the same time, the team has been investing in the core systems of the business to globalize them or to modernize the technology stack, really in the same way that we've been consistently doing with Expedia, Hotels.com, et cetera. Egencia has been a little later in coming just because of all the integrations that the team has been driving, but we feel like we're in a really good spot where the team is starting to deliver just excellent innovation on the product side. The sale, the response to our sales pictures, et cetera, has been very attractive, and we just continue to gain share in the core travel marketplace. We think that we are competing against a set of competitors who has fundamentally not made the shift online, has fundamentally not made the shift to agile technology, and we think this is the time for it to double down. So seeing the very strong results in the first quarter, we were already planning to invest in the Egencia sales team, but the pattern for our company overall Expedia, Inc. is, when we see some strength, we like to lean into that strength. And with Egencia, we're seeing strength, we're leaning into that strength, and it will be safe to assume that the sales plan and the sales hiring plan for Egencia is higher today than where we started a year from and that's a great thing. As far as HomeAway, the differences in conversion, we're not going to disclose specific differences, but it's safe to assume that online bookable properties convert and produce at better rates  sorry, instant bookable properties produce at stronger rates than simply online bookable properties. Right now, the focus is moving the folks to online bookable, and we will quickly shift to getting as much of them instant bookable as possible. Operator We'll go next to Michael Millman with Millman Research Associates. Michael Millman - Millman Research Associates Thank you. Kind of following up on some of the things you suggested. Interested in your thoughts on if you see some major disruptive technology on the horizon and if so, where so and when so? And does it involve AI or what it may involve? And sort of unrelated to that, can you talk about what you're seeing in timeshare business as competitive for HomeAway and for maybe some of the related type of companies? Thank you. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. I think AI is a good deal down the road. I think, right now, we are more dependent on OI, organic intelligence, here of folks here at the company. I think as far as disruptive technology, I do like to talk about the 3Ms, and it's not disruptive. It's just happening. One is mobile for us. And right now with most brands, over a-third of our transactions are mobile. Over half of our traffic is mobile. And the cool thing about mobile is it's always on, and it gives you location context. The second M for us that's emerging, especially in the APAC markets are messaging. And what messaging does for us is, it allows two-way communication at any time, but it also combines identity with our communication. And once you have identity, you can start communicating with someone on a one-to-one basis. Most of our systems right now are built to serve the average. Basically as a consumer when you come to Expedia, most of our systems are built to serve the average consumer. Now more and more we can optimize to the specific customer. And you combine that with a third M, which is machine learning, it is only possible to optimize to the individual based on very significant amounts of data, very significant amounts of interaction, so that you can start treating every single customer in a different way. You can go back to the olden days, when you're travel agent knew exactly what you wanted. This is going to be disruptive, but it's going to be a slow disruption as we learn more and more about you, as you tell us more and more about you through your behavior and otherwise give us more data, but we think that, that personal one-to-one connection is something that's coming over a period of time. And we think that because we have so many opportunities to interact with a customer we are  and also because we are investing significantly in technology, in product, in user interaction, I think, that we are one of the best positioned companies in travel to take advantage of it. So call it a slow disruption, but it is absolutely coming. As far as the timeshare business as it relates to HomeAway, I think the timeshare companies and timeshare owners probably are participants in the HomeAway marketplace, but I can't say that it's something that we talk about on a significant basis in the HomeAway haul. So I'm sure they're part of the marketplace, but at this point, it's not a significant portion of our strategy. Operator We'll go next to Perry Gold with MoffettNathanson. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Two please, if I may. Is there any other color you can provide on the overall performance at your OTA brand other than Orbitz? And then also the step-up at inter-company eliminations, does that just have to do with Expedia's brand taking more share on trivago or driving more traffic through trivago relative to other channels? Thanks so much. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Sure. I'll take those, Perry. But just take the second one first. The answer is yes. That is largely due to our brands, so it could be Brand Expedia, Hotels.com taking share in the trivago channel and doing very well there. Super attractive channel right now in the market, generally just because it's growing so quickly and our brands are performing well, and we're very happy with the performance there, so it shows up in that number. In terms of overall performance at the core OTA brands, I think Brand Expedia is doing very well right now. It's great to have that team refocused on the core business and not so focused on integrations. They did a phenomenal job of those integrations. But as we all know, they did take a toll on the results, but that team is right back to business as usual. They're thrilled to be back to business as usual, and they're thrilled with the opportunity ahead of them, and they're going after it, and the results are starting to show up. We're pleased with what we're seeing at Hotels.com as well. That team has been executing very well for a long period of time. They've got a great rewards program, and they continue to press on that. Their international growth, I mentioned South Korea is impressive, and they just continue to execute on their formula around the world. And then I'd also call out our private label business, the Expedia Affiliate Network business, who had a really good year last year and is just on a really solid footing this year, just exceptional results really powering the whole industry, offline travel agencies, corporate travel players, other online travel agencies, airlines, all with our world-class agency and merchant hotel inventory. And I'd just say the team is executing very well there, and we're very excited about what that team can do. Operator We'll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question. I think in a number of industry forums it's come up recently that paid marketing channels might actually be increasing their importance in terms of the way consumers are finding travel brands, planning their travel, you obviously have a play on that with trivago, but I don't know, if either Dara or Mark, if you would like to talk about the importance of the paid marketing channels, how relative ROIs might be evolving at some of those channels versus what you can do brand building and trying to drive more direct traffic over time and maybe lowering your overall ROI over time. Thanks, guys. Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Sure, Eric. In general, listen, I think it's accurate to say that the paid channels are growing their audience share in terms of travel spend, and the fastest share growth is coming from the meta channels, and the fastest share grower in the meta channels is trivago. That team is really executing on a world-class basis, and trivago I think as far as audience share as far as the channel goes, probably the fastest-growing scaled channel there is in terms of audience. And that's a great thing. And as it relates to our relationship with these paid channels, I think, in general, the OTAs are consistently investing in conversion, in user experience and in data science that allows us to get call it a higher share of those paid channels than the other players out there. So while from a profitability margin basis, the increase in growth of those paid channels hurts our margin, we talked a little bit about our sales and marketing margin as a percentage of revenue. From a share standpoint, it is unquestionably a positive for us, and it's a bigger positive because trivago is a part of the family. We're very strict on ROIs and in general, ROIs for us look stable, and they look good, and we view the paid channels as very significant means for us to gain share and a significant means for us to go acquire new customers, especially in international markets. And then, if we provide them for  if we provide those customers a great experience, again and again, we see that a certain percentage of those customers move over to repeat customers and stay with us and come direct. And when you look at the profit dollars that are coming into, call it, the big two OTAs, you can certainly see that the profit dollars and the profit dollar growth there is quite healthy on a global basis. And at this point, I don't see anything that would change that. Operator And we'll go next to Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Seth Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thanks for the question. This is Seth on for Lloyd. I was wondering if you could provide any additional color as to how HomeAway contributed to room night growth in the quarter and what the core room night year-over-year was, as it seems to slowed even given the ex-Easter and leap year impact? Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Yeah. So HomeAway's standalone stayed room night growth was right in line with the rest of the business. So it didn't have an impact. It did help the books room night metric that we gave you. But I think also just keep in mind that the other number we gave is just around the global brands, which grew about 17% year-over-year on a stayed basis. So HomeAway was a factor, but it didn't change the story at all for us. Next question please? Operator That is all the time we have questions for today. So I'll hand the call back over for Alan Pickerill for any additional or closing remarks. Alan Pickerill - Expedia, Inc. Great job. Thanks everybody for joining us today. We appreciate it. Dara, any closing remarks? Dara Khosrowshahi - Expedia, Inc. Just thank you to our team on a global basis. We're off to a good start, and let's keep it that way. Thanks. Mark D. Okerstrom - Expedia, Inc. Thank you. Operator That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. We started the year off with a good quarter. Our community continues to grow, with more than 1.9 billion people now using Facebook every month and almost 1.3 billion people using it every day. Our ads business is doing well too. Total revenue grew by 49% year over year to $8 billion, and advertising revenue was up 51% to $7.9 billion. In my letter to our community back in February, I talked about how for the past decade Facebook has focused on connecting friends and family. Now with that foundation, our next focus will be building community. There's a lot to do here. Building a global community is bigger than any one organization, but we can help by developing social infrastructure for communities, for supporting us, for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement, and for including everyone. Building a global community that works for everyone starts with building millions of smaller supportive communities. This is especially important, since membership in many physical communities is declining. We recently found that more than 100 million people on Facebook are members of what we call very meaningful groups, like parenting or rare diseases, support groups that are an important part of their support structure. My hope is to help more than 1 billion people join meaningful groups to strengthen our social fabric over the next few years. To help build a safe community, we launched Community Help, a tool that allows people to give and get things like food, shelter, or transportation in the wake of a natural disaster. We also launched a new fundraising tool that allows people to raise money for themselves, a friend, or a cause that isn't already on Facebook. But it's clear we have more to do here. We're going to continue building new tools to keep people safe on our platform. Over the next year, we'll be adding 3,000 people to our Community Operations team around the world on top of the 4,500 we already have today to review the millions of reports we get every week and to improve the process for doing that quickly. To help build a more informed community, we make changes to our News Feed ranking to reduce the financial motivation to spread hoaxes. We're working with independent fact-checkers to give people more information on whether an article has been disputed. We launched an educational tool at the top of News Feed in 14 countries to help people spot false news. And we're beginning to test related articles that appear before you read an article, giving you easier access to more perspectives and information. We're also helping to build a more civically engaged community. In March we launched Town Hall to help people find and connect with their government representatives on a local, state, and federal level in the U.S. In just the first month, we created more than 1 million new connections between people and their representatives. We also rolled out a tool in France ahead of their election that allows candidates to share statements about where they stand on different policy issues. So these are some of the changes we've made to help people build stronger communities. Next I want to give a quick update on what we're building over our three time horizons, how we're making our core services more useful and engaging right now, how we're building ecosystems around products that a lot of people are already using over the next five years, and how we're investing in the technologies that will give more people a voice and make sharing more immersive over the next 10 years. This quarter we launched a set of new cameras. Photos and video are becoming more common than text, so the camera is becoming more central then the text box in all of our apps. In the Facebook app, you can now swipe right from News Feed to access our new camera with masks, frames, and filters. We've developed new computer vision tools that can apply the style of a painting to a photo or video, and we can do that in real time on your phone for the first time. This is part of making the camera the first augmented reality platform. We want to give developers the power to build all kinds of AR tools in the camera so more people can experience augmented reality on their phone. Creating the first open camera platform is a huge step forward, and we're excited to keep pushing augmented reality forward. We also expanded the Stories format to give people more new ways to share. Instagram Stories now has more than 200 million daily active people using it. And just a couple months after we launched it, WhatsApp Status has more than 175 million daily active people using it. More recently, we also rolled out Messenger Day and Facebook Stories, and we're going to keep putting video at the center of all these services. Over the next five years, we're going build ecosystems around our products that a lot of people are already using. I put live video in this category. Last month we announced that one in every five Facebook videos is a live broadcast. And over the past year, daily watch time for Facebook Live broadcasts has grown by more than four times. This year we also gave people the ability to go live in 360. Messenger is in this category too. And we just announced that 1.2 billion people use Messenger every month. At F8, we launched the second generation of our Messenger platform and introduced the Discover tab to make it easier to find the best experiences quickly. Finally, over the next 10 years, we're developing consumer use cases around technologies that are a big part of our future, but won't be a part of our business, a big part of the business for a while. On the connectivity side, in April we successfully simultaneously beamed 16 gigabits of data in each direction between a location on the ground and a Cessna aircraft circling more than 7 kilometers away. Eventually, we're going to use this technology along with Aquila, our solar powered plane that we're building, to beam Internet to parts of the world that currently don't have access. In virtual reality, we launched Facebook Spaces, the first social VR platform that lets you create your own avatar and hang out with your friends. And we also released the Facebook 360 app for Gear VR that makes it easier to discover and experience in 360 photos and videos. And we continue to ship RIFT and Touch to people everywhere and deliver a strong content ecosystem across both RIFT and Gear VR. As people share more video, as we explore more things like augmented reality, and as we build more tools to keep our community safe, we're going to keep investing aggressively in the infrastructure that we need to grow and serve our community. That's why we announced that our next two data centers will be built in Odense, Denmark and Papillion, Nebraska. We've made some good progress. We have a lot more to do to help build community and connect the world. I want to thank everyone in our community, our teams, our partners, and all of you for being a part of this journey with us. And now here's Sheryl. Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had a strong first quarter and a great start to the year. Q1 ad revenue grew 51% year over year. Mobile ad revenue was $6.7 billion, up 58% year over year, and was approximately 85% of total ad revenue. Growth again this quarter was broad-based across regions, marketer segments, and verticals. Our goal is to build meaningful connections between businesses and people. We're doing this by focusing on three key priorities: helping businesses leverage the power of mobile; developing innovative ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective. Our first priority is helping businesses leverage the power of mobile. More businesses around the world are shifting to marketing on mobile. Over 70 million businesses are now using Facebook Pages around the world on a monthly basis, and more and more of them are becoming advertisers. We also recently announced that over 5 million businesses are actively advertising on Facebook, including more than 1 million in emerging markets. Most of these advertisers start by using our free Pages product because it's easy to use. People are increasingly recognizing that the small screen is big. Our Creative Hub is providing tools that make it easier to create ads optimized for mobile, what we talk about as thumb stopping creative. Marketers can see previews of their ads across Facebook and Instagram before rolling them out and get tips to help drive business results. Our second priority is developing innovative ad products that help businesses make the most out of their campaigns. We continue to improve Dynamic Ads, which enable advertisers to promote their full range of products across all devices. Advertisers can now target Dynamic Ads to broad audiences and are seeing great results. Last week I visited home retailer Wayfair in Boston. They use Dynamic Ads to reach a large audience with personalized recommendations from their catalog of over 8 million items. By finding higher revenue customers at a lower cost, the campaign beat Wayfair's return on ad spend goal by more than 20%. We're also helping marketers use video to capture shoppers' attention. People are watching more video on Facebook than ever before, and it's changing how they connect with businesses. In a recent study Facebook commissioned with Kantar, 30% of mobile shoppers said video is the best way to discover new products. This quarter, we introduced a new ad format called Collection. Collection helps marketers tell stories on mobile by combining creative videos or photos of product images. Clicking on the products leads to an immersive shopping experience, driving purchase consideration and ultimately sales. For example, adidas, which is how you pronounce them at their headquarters, and its agency, iProspect, created a video highlighting the innovative future of a Z.N.E. road trip party. Using our Collection ad format, adidas featured four more items from their product catalog below the video. They saw a 5.3 times return on ad spend and a 1.8 times decrease in cost per conversion. It's still early for this new format, but it's a great example of how we can deliver innovative mobile experiences that work for advertisers and work for people. This quarter we also launched full-screen sound-on ads in Instagram Stories. Advertisers can now reach over 200 million daily actives on Stories to do everything from building brands to selling products. Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. Measurement is critical. We recently introduced new and expanded verification partnerships and committed to audits with the Media Rating Council. Whether marketers are trying to get people to buy something on their website or in their store, we now have systems in place to help them measure results and third-party partnerships to verify those results. These are important steps as we continue to build the advertiser trough. Bud Light's NFL campaign is a great example. To promote the designs of their new team-specific cans, Bud Light took a national and regional approach. They ran video ads featuring the new cans to people ages 21 to 49 in the U.S. Then they also ran more targeted ads in each region featuring the two cans of the teams playing each other. Using Facebook polling and Oracle data cloud, they saw a 24-point lift in ad recall and a 4.4 times return on ad sales. We know marketers want to compare results across platforms and placements. Historically, we've enabled larger marketers to do this. In Q1 we started testing a set of advanced measurement tools that make it easier for marketers of all sizes to compare the effectiveness of Facebook, Instagram, and Audience Network alongside other publishers. We're off to a strong start in 2017. We're helping marketers leverage the power of mobile, developing innovative ad products, and delivering proven and measurable results. We're excited about the growing adoption of our platforms, and we're going to continue to invest in helping businesses and people connect. Thanks, and now here's Dave. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a strong quarter for Facebook. We continued to see healthy growth in engagement trends across our community as well as broad-based growth in our ads business. Let's start with our community metrics. In March, 1.28 billion people visited Facebook on an average day, up 18% compared to last year. This daily number represented 66% of the 1.94 billion people that visited Facebook during the month of March, which was up 282 million or 17% compared to last year. Our community growth in Q1 was driven by product improvement, internet.org, and ongoing third-party promotional data plans in markets like India. Note that we do not control the timing or terms of these promotions. Before diving into the financials, I want to highlight that we are no longer reporting non-GAAP expenses, income, tax rate, or EPS. Given that stock is an important part of our compensation structure, we believe that investors should focus on our financial performance with stock-based compensation included. Turning now to the financials, all of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $8 billion, up 49%. Ad revenue was $7.9 billion, up 51%. Exchange rates did not affect our overall growth rate this quarter, as headwinds in certain currencies were offset by tailwinds in others. In terms of regional advertising growth, rest-of-world and Asia-Pacific were our strongest growers in percentage terms at 66% and 60% respectively. Both regions benefited from particularly strong advertiser demand. Europe and North America both grew at 47%. Mobile ad revenue was $6.7 billion, up 58%, and represented approximately 85% of ad revenue. Desktop ad revenue grew 22% despite a decline in desktop usage and was aided by our recent effort to limit the impact of ad blocking technologies, which we began in Q3 of last year. Our mobile ads business continued to be driven by healthy supply and demand in apps (15:41). In Q1, the average price per ad increased 14% and the total number of ad impressions served increased 32%, primarily driven by mobile feed ads. Payments and other fees revenue was $175 million, down 3%. Q1 total expenses were $4.7 billion, up 40%. In 2017, we have continued to accelerate our hiring efforts. We added over 1,700 employees in Q1, predominantly in technical and recruiting functions, and ended the quarter with approximately 18,800 employees, up 38% compared to last year. This marked an acceleration from the 34% growth rate in Q4. Q1 operating income was $3.3 billion, representing a 41% margin. Our tax rate was 10%, which reflects the adoption of ASU 2016-9 in the fourth quarter. Excluding this adoption, our tax rate would have been approximately 9 percentage points higher. Note that the new accounting guidance does not impact the cash taxes we pay but merely how the tax provision is presented under GAAP, whereby now excess tax benefits are flowing through the P&L and in this quarter positively impacted EPS. Net income was $3.1 billion or $1.04 per share. Q1 capital expenditures were approximately $1.3 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office facilities, and network infrastructure. In Q1 we also broke ground on our ninth data center in Nebraska. We generated approximately $3.8 billion in free cash flow. In the first quarter, we repurchased $228 million of our Class A common stock and used $771 million in cash for taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards. We ended the quarter with $32.3 billion in cash and investments. Turning now to the outlook, with regards to revenue, we continue to expect that our ad revenue growth rates will come down meaningfully over the course of 2017. We expect that ad loads will play a less significant factor in driving revenue growth after mid-2017. We also expect desktop ad revenue growth rates to slow in the third quarter when we begin to lap our efforts to limit the impact of ad blockers. We continue to expect that our full-year 2017 payments and other fees revenue will decline compared to full-year 2016. As a reminder, payments and other fees revenue is primarily generated from payments related to games played on personal computers. Turning to the expense outlook, we continue to expect that full-year 2017 GAAP expenses will grow 40% to 50% compared to full-year 2016. I would note that as we look into 2017 and beyond, there are going be a number of initiatives we believe are valuable to the community and to the company in the long term that are going be net negative on our operating margin. We are embarking on a significant ramp up in infrastructure supporting global growth, and we continue to expect that full-year 2017 capital expenditures will be in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion, which is up over 50% compared to last year. Turning now to tax, as we noted in the last call, under the new accounting guidance, our tax rate will vary based on our stock price. At current stock prices, we expect that our Q2 and full-year 2017 tax rates will both be in the mid-teens, so up from the first quarter rate. In summary, Q1 was a strong quarter and a great start to the year. Growth in the Facebook community remains strong. Engagement across our family of apps is healthy and growing, and advertiser demand from our growing base of marketers is robust. Importantly, we continue to invest aggressively to build our business and drive value for our community over the long term. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question, maybe one thematic question on Instagram for Mark and Sheryl. I wanted to understand what you're seeing in terms of the development of the community on the user growth side, the engagement side, as well as on the monetization side with respect to breadth of advertisers and ad product evolution, what that means for Instagram's future and how it compares to maybe what you've learned growing the business on the Facebook side over the last couple years. Thanks so much. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. Eric, why don't I take that and then Sheryl can augment with some additional color? So when you think about Instagram, we're seeing great growth there with the community. So this past quarter, we announced 700 million monthly actives, so that was a big announcement. And that's broad-based growth across the globe, so we're pleased with that. In terms of the development on the advertising side, we're not specifically breaking out Instagram revenue, as you know, because that's sold through the same Facebook ad interfaces, but we're seeing really good contribution and good growth there. And we're developing it across a wide variety of ad products, so VR is becoming a more significant part of the Instagram story, where it was originally more brand-focused. But we've expanded the product offerings on the Direct Response front, and we're continuing to bring more ad products to Instagram. Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. We're pretty excited about what's happening in the Instagram ad space because Facebook and Instagram are the two most important mobile ad platforms. And there's a special property with Instagram, which is that the increasing visualization of ads and the creative canvas it offers with the science behind the Facebook targeting and measurement system is really a pretty unusual combination. We're also seeing very broad adoption, including small customers. We are pretty excited to have 1 million advertisers and 8 million Instagram business profiles on the platform. To share one example, an online store in Brazil called Loja Nama, they sell decorative items and accessories. Their business owner, Joanna [Cariello], took photos of her products on her phone and then created ads with our Shop Now button. She targeted young audiences in Brazil who are interested in fashion, decoration, movies, and architecture. And during the period of her campaign, Instagram accounted for 79% of her sales. And I think what that shows is the power of the very sophisticated targeting we offer across our platforms along with really the ability to use very simple tools like a phone to create very sophisticated but visually compelling ads. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question, one for Mark and then perhaps one for Sheryl or Dave. Mark, first just on the video strategy, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how that's evolving in terms of the type of content that you're licensing and featuring within the Facebook Video tab, and then if you have any more clarity just on how the economics are going to work there around revenue share and gross margins. And then on ad revenue, the U.S. and Canada was very strong at 47% growth, but at the same time it also did decel a little bit more than we've seen in recent quarters. I was just wondering if there was anything else to call out there. Thank you. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. Yes. Doug, why don't I take the decel question on the U.S. and Canada? I don't think there was anything particularly surprising about the deceleration in the growth in the U.S. and Canada. We've been talking about expecting a deceleration in ad revenue growth, and we saw that play out in the U.S. and Canada modestly. Obviously, we were particularly pleased that there was really strong demand that benefited regions like APAC and rest-of-world, so really broad-based strength in APAC. And then rest-of-world, we saw a rebound in Latin America, especially Brazil, so we're seeing some particular strength there. So I think that I think was a big highlight. On the content front, we're looking at investing in kick-starting an ecosystem for longer-form content on Facebook, and that involves us working with content providers to develop that content. In the long run, we expect to see a revenue share model on the platform. And obviously, we're going to be in an area where we're sharing revenue with content providers, so it's going to have a different margin profile than core Facebook News Feed from an expense profile perspective. Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. I think you pretty much got that. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. Okay. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Mark on Messenger monetization. Can you just talk about some of the biggest trends you're monitoring and what you're most excited about as you think about ways to monetize Messenger over the next two or three years? And then on engagement, you continue to grow Instagram and Messenger user bases really healthily. I guess I'd be curious to hear, do you still continue to see rising time spent per user across all three of those platforms, even as the DAU base gets bigger? Thanks. Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. Can you start with the stats, Wehner? David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. Sure. Yes, I can start with the stats, Mark. On the engagement front, we're seeing time spent growth per DAU across the Facebook family of apps, and that includes Facebook itself. Instagram has been strong, especially with Feed Ranking and Stories. We're not breaking out specific time spent stats on a quarterly basis on those. And then on the Messenger monetization front...? Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. I can talk about the strategy. The first thing that we need to do on Messenger and WhatsApp is get a lot of businesses using it organically and build the behavior for people that they reach out to businesses for different things, like customer support or for getting news content, things that may not eventually be the big business use cases but establish the behavior of people interacting not only with their close friends, but also with businesses. In terms of making money on that, once we have that behavior, I think there are going to be a number of ways that we can amplify that. We're already experimenting with a couple. One is ads that actually display a News Feed, not in Messenger or WhatsApp, but that link to the ability to communicate with a business directly in Messenger or eventually WhatsApp. And that's great, it converts better for the businesses. They can have a better dialogue with the person and a persistent relationship. So that's one way that I think that this will be valuable. The other way is of course eventually showing paid content in Messenger, whether that's in the inbox or in relevant ways throughout the product. But the top priority right now is just building out the base of organic interaction between people and businesses that they want to interact with. And once we get that to a big base, then there are going to be a lot of opportunities to build a business, and the business will be proportional to the amount of that activity that people want to do organically. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Great, thank you, a couple things on advertising and modeling. When we think about Q1, can you help us at all think about how much the ad load growth is contributing and what drove the improvement in pricing in the quarter? And then, Dave, when you look out to the third quarter and you lap the ad blocking on desktop, are there more ad blocking you can do to help maintain that growth, or are there other drivers there for desktop that we can think about? Thank you. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. Sure, Justin. I'm not breaking out specific drivers on the supply side. Supply growth was healthy, and we had contributions from users' time spent and ad load in the quarter. In terms of what drove the improvement in the pricing, it's strong demand, so that's playing through in the face of a little bit slower supply growth. And so you're seeing  of course, the auction drives pricing and there has been interplay between the supply growth and the pricing growth, and we're seeing the strong demand play through on the pricing side. When we get to lapping our efforts on desktop, I do think you're going to  you have a secular trend away from desktop. So that's going be an overall factor in desktop, our ability to grow and maintain the desktop business, so I think that's an underlying factor. We're always going be in a back-and-forth with ad blockers on the desktop side. So I think that's going to constantly be a thing that plays into the desktop revenue. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great, thanks. First off I guess is a follow-up on the earlier video question from Doug. Could you add some perspective on engagement trends with video content and video ads such as average viewing time and whether this mix is what is impacting impression growth? And then more broadly, if you can offer some perspective on how much of the video ad spending on Facebook applications are incremental to television budgets, or if there's any evidence you're seeing of a share shift. Thank you. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. Sure, Colin. I'll take that first one. So impression growth was 32% in Q1, as I noted, and that was a bit slower than in previous quarters. Those of you who have been following us for a while know that periodically we make changes to the product that is going to impact some of the metrics. One of the things that I would call out in Q1 as a contributing factor on the impression growth side was our decision to rank longer-form video higher in News Feed. That means more time in video, and that does come at the expense of some impression growth in News Feed. So I think you do see some interplay there on the impression growth side due to our focus on video. And then Sheryl was going to follow up on the video ad spending. Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. On TV, we are definitely seeing people continue to advertise on TV and use us as a complement. So over time, we believe that the dollar shifts with eyeballs and we want to earn it from our clients and be the best dollar and the best minute they spend and help them measure across channels. I think increasingly, the question is not if you can do without TV, but it's if you can do without mobile. And we're working hard to help advertisers develop the video creative that really works for mobile because that really makes a really big difference. And we think the combination of the creative working for mobile but also the measurement and targeting we can do is a very powerful offer. To share one of my favorite new examples, Subway working with their agency 360i developed video ads and images for Facebook and Instagram to promote the limited time offer Reuben sandwich. And they used Audience Insights, targeting people ages 18 to 49 who purchase meat and cheese, and that's just pretty incredible targeting. Nowhere else I don't think you can actually target that way and people interested in fast food and encourage them to visit Subways. They then used Nielsen Brand Effects and were able to measure a 16-point lift in ad recall and a 5-point lift in intent to visit Subway. So it's a really unique combination of the power of creative that was designed for video for mobile with very specific targeting and very specific measurements. Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge from Cowen. John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC Thanks, two questions. Mark, you mentioned adding 3,000 reviewers to content at Facebook. Could artificial intelligence be used over time to help solve some of the monitoring? And then just more broadly, how is AI being employed in the processes at the company now versus a couple years ago? And then second item would be, could newer ad units like mid-roll video help mitigate the decel from the lower ad load growth contribution in second half 2017? Thank you. Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. I'll talk to the content and AI questions, and then someone else can talk about the ad piece. The short answer is yes. AI tools over time will be able to do a better job of flagging things for the set of people who are in the Community Ops teams that we can prioritize what we look at. A lot of what we're trying to do here is not just about getting content off Facebook. Last week there was this case where someone was using Facebook Live to broadcast  or was thinking about suicide. And we saw that video and actually didn't take it down and helped get in touch with law enforcement who used that live video to communicate with that person and help save their life. So a lot of what we're trying to do is not just about taking the content down, but also about helping people when they're in need on the platform, and we take that very, very seriously. Over time, the AI tools will get better. Right now there are certain things that AI can do in terms of understanding text and understanding what's in a photo and what's in a video. That will get better over time. That will take a period of years, though, to really reach the quality level that we want. So for a while, our strategy has been to just continue building as good tools as we can because no matter how many people we have on the team, we're never going to be able to look at everything. So that's going be a big challenge. But given the importance of this and how quickly live video is growing, we wanted to make sure that we doubled down on this and made sure we provided as safe of an experience for the community as we can, which is why we're almost doubling the size of the Community Ops team to focus on some of these issues around safety on live video. But over time for sure, more AI will do this, but this is over a period of years. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. John, I think your question then was on Ad Breaks and then the mid-roll type of format. I think there we're testing the ability and are putting short Ad Breaks into longer-form live and on-demand videos. Tests are going well, but it's really early days to talk about that being a significant contributor, so we're working to continue to make those products better and continuing those tests, but it's early. On that front, we're focused on building out the best video experiences for our community and growing longer-form content as a priority. And Ad Breaks is going to allow us to have a monetization strategy with that longer-form content. But like I said, it's early. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great, thank you. I guess I had a question just related to Instagram and Facebook Stories. We've talked a lot about ad load growth over the last year, and Dave's been talking about the pending slowdown, which I think we're all expecting. But how do we think about these new applications or new ways to engage with the apps at the top of your phone, where you're starting to see ad insertion show up as well? Is that thought of as different than the general ad load comments that, Dave, you're making? I'm sorry to split hairs here, but I'm just trying to get a sense of how to think about when they're starting to show up in new places. And then I guess I just had a follow-up for Sheryl. And one question in particular was if there's any measurement metrics that advertisers are asking for now that if you could help them with, it would make them even more eager to shift their budgets over from TV and follow their eyeballs? Sorry, thank you. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. So, Heather, on Stories, again, it's a pretty similar answer, I think, to Ad Breaks in the sense that it's early in terms of using the ads formats in Stories. We've certainly rolled those out. They are not in the ad load calculation per se. So it is different, as you said, from the ad load commentary that I've given. But obviously, it's very early on those products. And then, Sheryl, you had the question about measurement metrics. Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. Yes, we know that measurement is so critical, and we really want to measure core business results and focus on becoming the number one growth driver for our clients. We are continuing to constantly review our metrics. When we find bugs or errors, we're reporting them to our clients and addressing the issue and continuing with that analysis as we work through all of our metrics. We're also very focused on extending measurement partnerships and third-party verification. This last quarter we extended viewability measurement to the Audience Network, added another verification partner, DoubleVerify, for video and display measurement, and introduced our MMM [Marketing Mix Modeling] portal so that we can help people measure across all of the different platforms and compare the effectiveness of their ad spend no matter what their end goal is. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Nomura Instinet. Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet Thank you very much. I have one for Mark and one for Sheryl. Mark, at F8 and in your comments today, you talked about making the camera central to the app, making the camera the first augmented reality platform. I know it's early, but can you maybe share with us your thoughts about the potential commercial application of augmented reality as you see it today? And then, Sheryl, there's been more lately about the use and effectiveness of influencer marketing on both Facebook and Instagram. How is Facebook thinking about sharing in the economics of when brands use celebrities or influencers to market their products using their Facebook posts? Is it by bringing more transactions onto the platform, building on the shopping experience on Facebook? How is Facebook going to share in those economics? Thank you. Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. All right, I can start by talking about augmented reality. The big step forward that we announced at F8 is that there are lots of different apps that have cameras in them or that independent developers just build an app that has a single camera effect. But what we're basically saying is that there's so much innovation and so many different types of effects that people are creating that we don't want developers to have to build their own separate app and get to a huge scale in order to build some new kind of visual tool. So we built  we're making the cameras inside the whole family of apps into the first augmented reality platform, into an open platform, which is different from what any other app that has a camera has done before. It's going to open up a much greater diversity of use cases, not only making it so that use cases like facemasks or style transfers that we already have, you're now going to have thousands of options instead of just 10 or 20 at a time. But there are also going to be all these new kinds of things that we're not even building today that developers will be able to experiment with. One of the examples I showed at F8 was around using object recognition and computer vision to be able to point your camera at something and then tap on it and get a card of information and maybe even a buy button. So there are lots of different ways that over time this kind of content is going to both augment existing real-world objects and eventually replace them, which I think is going to be an interesting opportunity. maybe not on augmented reality on the phone but on glasses eventually. When you have that, I think we're going get to a point where things like TVs, you no longer need a physical TV. You'll get a $1 app that you can watch it screen on. And it will just be an interesting exercise to see how many of the things that we have that are physical things don't actually need to be physical in that world, and how much innovation that opens up for independent developers all around the world. A lot of people don't have a factory, so they can't build a TV. But think about how many kids and different developers around the world, kids sitting in dorm rooms and all these different places are going be able to create things that today they couldn't. So I hope this is going to create a pretty interesting economy. So a lot of that stuff is pretty far out, five, ten years. But we want to be pushing this forward. I think we're a little bit late to the trend initially around making cameras the center of how sharing works. But I do think at this point, we're pretty much ahead in terms of the technology that we're building, and making it an open platform I think is a big is a big step forward. A lot of people are using these products across our family of apps, and I would expect us to continue leading the way forward on this from this point on. Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. When you think about influencer marketing, we definitely see publishers interested in it, brands interested in it. And so we've worked on branded content, the ability to tag a sponsor and share posts and insights. And the financial arrangement remains between the sponsor and the publisher. It's early, but we're seeing some positive results with publishers of many different types bringing branded content to Facebook. In Q1, we opened this up to unverified pages so we could enable more people to take advantage of this kind of targeting. We see this in the broader context of better targeting. When you think about what really drives great performance for both people who are using Facebook but for marketers, it's well-targeted ads. And so influencer marketing is one way to get there, but we're focused on a very full range of ability to target well. We've been really pleased with the adoption of our targeting products from Custom Audiences to Lookalikes to Dynamic Ads, and we think all of these can improve the relevance of the ad by making ads more targeted, because when they're more targeted, they have higher returns for marketers and they're more enjoyable or relevant for people. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC Great, thanks. First, I think it's a great move to go all-in GAAP in terms of reporting. Second, David, when you talked about the ads, your ad load commentary, I couldn't tell if there was a subtle shift there when you were saying that the ad load pressure would occur after the end of the year rather than in the second half of the year. And then third, this is for Sheryl and Mark. The recent stories about gender bias amongst engineers at Facebook, and I know you quickly responded to that and said if there were anything, there may be a rank bias, but in my mind it creates the opportunity potentially for Facebook to better tap into what is probably underappreciated female engineering talent in the Valley and across technology. How do you think about that as an opportunity for the company? Thank you. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. I'll just real quickly address the ad load issue, Mark. Sorry if it wasn't clear, really no change in outlook there. We continue to expect that we'll see deceleration in ad revenue growth. And that's going to be particularly pronounced as we get into the second half of 2017 because ad load will be a less significant factor driving growth starting in the second half. Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. On the issue you raised with the Facebook female engineers, I'm really glad to have a chance to address this because this is an issue I take very seriously. On the specific report on this study, the study was conducted by a former employee with very incomplete data. When that study was shared with people internally, and we have that culture where people do studies and share things, and we're really glad because that helps surface issues, we immediately conducted our own research using the full data. And what we found is that the main reason code was sent back at different rates was not correlated with gender. It was correlated with level, and the fact that we have more male senior engineers was explaining it. If you compared male and female engineers at the same level, there was not this discrepancy. Then that leads to the obvious question is are you promoting men and women at the same rate and the broader question of are you paying men and women fairly. And we do a comprehensive look at that every single promotion and pay and performance cycle we have, which is six months. And we know that we're promoting men and women at the same rate as men. Now that said, our industry still has issues and we still have issues. We don't have enough senior female engineers. We don't have enough women going into computer science, and we take this very seriously, from the work we've done with LinkedIn to get CS&E Lean In circles all over college campuses, to encourage more women and under-represented minorities to come into our field. We've had a really nice program in extra internships where we're taking people who are not yet majoring in computer science but we think have the ability, and teaching them for a summer and seeing them return, to the work we're doing with our female engineers to make sure that all forms of bias are surfaced and eliminated. And we can continue to use the full talents of the population. Nothing is more important to us. Operator Your next question comes from the line Ross Sandler from Barclays. Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Just had two questions on video. We know it's early, but what kind of traction do you see with the video tab that's in beta? And do you think longer term the video consumption is going to be in that dedicated tab, or will it stay in the News Feed based on what you're seeing right now? And then, Dave, just to follow up on your previous answers, so are the costs related to video ad rev share or licensing of video content, is that baked into your OpEx guidance for 2017, or is that something that will step up after this year? Thank you. Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. I don't know if we have any public stats on the video tab, probably not. But in terms of the strategy, I can talk about that quickly. There were two basic use cases for checking in with Facebook and seeing what's going on in the world. What people do with News Feed a lot of the time is they have a few free minutes, or you want to sit down for maybe a longer session to see everything that's going on in the world. You don't have a specific intention to watch a specific type of content. You just want to check in and see what's going on in the world. There's this whole other use case around content, which is going to the app or sitting down at a TV because there's some content that you want to watch and you want to go directly to it. And that's what we're trying to do with the video tab, to make it so that all the different folks, whether they're pages that you follow or creators that you like, who you want to subscribe to and get the updates to what they're doing, that you have a place that you can go to with more intent to consume that content. The reason why it needs to be a different tab or at least a different service from News Feed is because people come to it with a different intent. I think you're going to start in the future getting people coming to Facebook for the News Feed use case of checking in and people coming with an intent to go to the video tab to watch a specific video. So that's what we're doing there. That's the strategy, and I guess we'll update on stats when we have them. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. And, Ross, on the costs related to the video ad rev share, yes, our guidance on total cost is all-inclusive, so it includes all the R&D investments we're making. It includes the content. It includes things like the Community Operations investments that we talked about today in the announcement. But I would say that the nature of the types of video content deals that we're doing will make them more likely to show up after 2017. So there will be some content expense in 2017, but I think it will be something you will see step up after 2017. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mark May from Citi. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you. Mark, in your prepared remarks, you talked about doing more to foster local communities and groups, and it would seem like one of the more interesting test cases here already is in Local Marketplaces. I was just wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about the kind of adoption and engagement that you've seen with Local Marketplaces and maybe anything that you've learned that you can apply to some of the newer initiatives that you're looking at? And then secondly, probably for Sheryl, for Ad Breaks to scale, it appears that content creators need to adapt their programming for this, and of course, users need to engage with the ads. So I guess the question is how are completion rates for Ad Breaks? I know it's early, but what are you seeing so far? And how would you characterize the willingness of content creators to adapt? Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. I can talk about Marketplace Groups first. So I think your basic point is right, that the reason why we started working on Marketplace and the tab around that is because when we were exploring what the biggest use cases were of Groups, we uncovered that a very large number of people, hundreds of millions, use Groups to buy and sell different things. And so these whole communities have formed, which was somewhat surprising to us honestly, because we hadn't developed that product specifically for buying and selling. It was for group communication and that's what people were using it for. So we decided hey, we're going to put together a team that's going to invest in making this actually good for buying and selling and see how much we can grow that economy. So I don't know that we have any public stats on that yet, but that's an area that I'm certainly very excited about. And then in terms of local communities, one of the big trends in the world that we've seen is just that participation in all kinds of different physical communities, whether they're sports teams or some religious groups or different kinds of different things, have been declining a lot over the past several decades. And that I think is a big social issue that is eroding the social fabric of the whole society, not just our country, but around the world. And that's one where I look at that and I wonder if Facebook can play a role in helping to strengthen that. We look at  there are more than 1 billion people every month who use our Groups product. But if you think about your own use of the Groups product, you probably are a member of a bunch of different groups that you maybe check in on very infrequently. So that's very different from  there's a handful of people, around 100 million or a bit more, who are a member of what we call a very meaningful group. So that could be a parenting group or you're diagnosed with a rare disease, and you can now connect with people all around the world to share stories around that. These are groups that upon joining, they become one of the things that you spend the most time with on Facebook, one of the most important parts of your experience, and a really fundamental part of your real-world support structure. So we look that that and we ask the question of hey, if 100 million people are in those very meaningful groups today, can we get that to be 1 billion people over next several years? And if so, then that can help reverse some of the decline in community membership and help strengthen the social fabric, not only in our country, but around the world. So that's a big part of what we're focused on across a number of different initiatives. Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. And I'll talk a little bit about the Ad Break, what we're seeing. It's really early both in terms of testing the ads and getting any feedback from users, so people who use Facebook, so we don't have that data to share. But we're pleased that the test is active. We're pleased that it's going well and that we can do both live and uploaded videos. We think over time that marketers will follow where people are spending their time. And if the ads can be well-targeted, we think we'll be able to see engagement, and we already see that. When ads are really well targeted and taking full advantage of the kind of targeting we offer, so you're showing people something they want to see, we see engagement that we think is really critical. It's also worth noting that the metrics that really matter at the end are driving sales. And so any of the engagement with ad metrics, whether it's remembering an ad going back to  people have been measuring that for a long time too, how long a video ad is viewed, are only proxy metrics. What matters is the impact on sales. And so we think the better we can do at getting the measurement to what actually matters, which is the end behavior marketers are trying to drive, the more people will shift their focus to business metrics, the better it will be for the returns they get and ultimately our business. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC Thanks. I have three philosophical questions on video for you guys. Anyone can grab them. The first is, it was interesting to see the NFL games go from Twitter to Amazon. I wonder. Do the NFL games fit with your video strategy, and why or why not? That's one. Two is, I know the model is revenue share, but a lot of the more traditional companies would like a license fee or the ability to sell their own inventory on your platform. Is that something you'd consider? And last but not least, the question about monetization, why is mid-roll optimal to pre-roll, and can you share anything about the testing of that concept? Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. I can talk about sports. So in terms of experimenting with different content, I think we'll try a number of different things here. In terms of working with folks to produce all kinds of content, sports is probably something that we'll want to try at some point. But again, like Dave said before, the goal is going to be creating some anchor content initially that helps people learn that going to the video tab that that's a great destination where they can explore and come to Facebook with the intent to watch the videos that they want. And then the long-term goal is actually not to be paying for specific content like that, but doing a revenue share model once the whole economy around video on Facebook is built up. But we're working on that, and I think we'll probably look at different pieces of content like this around the world, but at this point don't feel like any specific one of them is a must-have for us. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. And I think Mark touched on the question of business model here, and our focus really is on revenue share. We'll be investing to kick-start the ecosystem with content, so derisking it for some of our content partners to start off with, but the focus is really to build a rev-share model over time that's sustainable. That's the focus as opposed to other models. In terms of why mid-roll is preferable to pre-roll, Facebook is well suited for shorter-form content where we're ranking things to be longer-form as well. So we're ranking longer-form video, but that's still relatively short video views. And for that reason, we think mid-roll is a better user experience. Deborah Crawford - Facebook, Inc. Operator, I think we have time for one last question. Operator Your last question comes from the line of Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks very much, one for Sheryl. Sheryl, you talked a lot about the targeting advantage of Facebook, and you have a number of data signals and sources informing that. I'm wondering if you could talk about the relative importance of collecting signals on the platform versus off the platform, for instance, the behavior of Facebook users interacting with third-party websites. Is this the depth of your off-platform collection? Is this a significant competitive advantage for you? Thank you very much. Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. We think that targeting end measurement are significant competitive advantages for us. We're very focused on the privacy of what people do, wherever they do it, and using the information we have in a very responsible way. We believe that because people are sharing interests, because people are themselves their real identity on the Facebook platform, we have a significant advantage just in basic targeting itself. Just age and gender, we're 38% more accurate than broad-based targeting according to Nielsen in the U.S., and that's just age and gender. And then if you think about some of the key studies I shared, targeting people who purchase a certain item, targeting people who are interested in a certain item, we think that's very substantial. We also think that there's a real competitive advantage in focusing on business results, as we have. We're really working on shifting people to understanding what their real objectives are so that they can focus on driving businesses. At the end of the day, when you show an ad, you want to move a product off a lot, off a shelf, into a shopping cart, whether it's online or offline, and that's where our focus is and will continue to be. Deborah Crawford - Facebook, Inc. Great, thank you again, everybody, for joining us today. We appreciate your time, and we look forward to speaking with you again.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question, maybe one thematic question on Instagram for Mark and Sheryl. I wanted to understand what you're seeing in terms of the development of the community on the user growth side, the engagement side, as well as on the monetization side with respect to breadth of advertisers and ad product evolution, what that means for Instagram's future and how it compares to maybe what you've learned growing the business on the Facebook side over the last couple years. Thanks so much. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. Eric, why don't I take that and then Sheryl can augment with some additional color? So when you think about Instagram, we're seeing great growth there with the community. So this past quarter, we announced 700 million monthly actives, so that was a big announcement. And that's broad-based growth across the globe, so we're pleased with that. In terms of the development on the advertising side, we're not specifically breaking out Instagram revenue, as you know, because that's sold through the same Facebook ad interfaces, but we're seeing really good contribution and good growth there. And we're developing it across a wide variety of ad products, so VR is becoming a more significant part of the Instagram story, where it was originally more brand-focused. But we've expanded the product offerings on the Direct Response front, and we're continuing to bring more ad products to Instagram. Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. We're pretty excited about what's happening in the Instagram ad space because Facebook and Instagram are the two most important mobile ad platforms. And there's a special property with Instagram, which is that the increasing visualization of ads and the creative canvas it offers with the science behind the Facebook targeting and measurement system is really a pretty unusual combination. We're also seeing very broad adoption, including small customers. We are pretty excited to have 1 million advertisers and 8 million Instagram business profiles on the platform. To share one example, an online store in Brazil called Loja Nama, they sell decorative items and accessories. Their business owner, Joanna [Cariello], took photos of her products on her phone and then created ads with our Shop Now button. She targeted young audiences in Brazil who are interested in fashion, decoration, movies, and architecture. And during the period of her campaign, Instagram accounted for 79% of her sales. And I think what that shows is the power of the very sophisticated targeting we offer across our platforms along with really the ability to use very simple tools like a phone to create very sophisticated but visually compelling ads. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question, one for Mark and then perhaps one for Sheryl or Dave. Mark, first just on the video strategy, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how that's evolving in terms of the type of content that you're licensing and featuring within the Facebook Video tab, and then if you have any more clarity just on how the economics are going to work there around revenue share and gross margins. And then on ad revenue, the U.S. and Canada was very strong at 47% growth, but at the same time it also did decel a little bit more than we've seen in recent quarters. I was just wondering if there was anything else to call out there. Thank you. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. Yes. Doug, why don't I take the decel question on the U.S. and Canada? I don't think there was anything particularly surprising about the deceleration in the growth in the U.S. and Canada. We've been talking about expecting a deceleration in ad revenue growth, and we saw that play out in the U.S. and Canada modestly. Obviously, we were particularly pleased that there was really strong demand that benefited regions like APAC and rest-of-world, so really broad-based strength in APAC. And then rest-of-world, we saw a rebound in Latin America, especially Brazil, so we're seeing some particular strength there. So I think that I think was a big highlight. On the content front, we're looking at investing in kick-starting an ecosystem for longer-form content on Facebook, and that involves us working with content providers to develop that content. In the long run, we expect to see a revenue share model on the platform. And obviously, we're going to be in an area where we're sharing revenue with content providers, so it's going to have a different margin profile than core Facebook News Feed from an expense profile perspective. Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. I think you pretty much got that. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. Okay. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Mark on Messenger monetization. Can you just talk about some of the biggest trends you're monitoring and what you're most excited about as you think about ways to monetize Messenger over the next two or three years? And then on engagement, you continue to grow Instagram and Messenger user bases really healthily. I guess I'd be curious to hear, do you still continue to see rising time spent per user across all three of those platforms, even as the DAU base gets bigger? Thanks. Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. Can you start with the stats, Wehner? David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. Sure. Yes, I can start with the stats, Mark. On the engagement front, we're seeing time spent growth per DAU across the Facebook family of apps, and that includes Facebook itself. Instagram has been strong, especially with Feed Ranking and Stories. We're not breaking out specific time spent stats on a quarterly basis on those. And then on the Messenger monetization front...? Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. I can talk about the strategy. The first thing that we need to do on Messenger and WhatsApp is get a lot of businesses using it organically and build the behavior for people that they reach out to businesses for different things, like customer support or for getting news content, things that may not eventually be the big business use cases but establish the behavior of people interacting not only with their close friends, but also with businesses. In terms of making money on that, once we have that behavior, I think there are going to be a number of ways that we can amplify that. We're already experimenting with a couple. One is ads that actually display a News Feed, not in Messenger or WhatsApp, but that link to the ability to communicate with a business directly in Messenger or eventually WhatsApp. And that's great, it converts better for the businesses. They can have a better dialogue with the person and a persistent relationship. So that's one way that I think that this will be valuable. The other way is of course eventually showing paid content in Messenger, whether that's in the inbox or in relevant ways throughout the product. But the top priority right now is just building out the base of organic interaction between people and businesses that they want to interact with. And once we get that to a big base, then there are going to be a lot of opportunities to build a business, and the business will be proportional to the amount of that activity that people want to do organically. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Great, thank you, a couple things on advertising and modeling. When we think about Q1, can you help us at all think about how much the ad load growth is contributing and what drove the improvement in pricing in the quarter? And then, Dave, when you look out to the third quarter and you lap the ad blocking on desktop, are there more ad blocking you can do to help maintain that growth, or are there other drivers there for desktop that we can think about? Thank you. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. Sure, Justin. I'm not breaking out specific drivers on the supply side. Supply growth was healthy, and we had contributions from users' time spent and ad load in the quarter. In terms of what drove the improvement in the pricing, it's strong demand, so that's playing through in the face of a little bit slower supply growth. And so you're seeing  of course, the auction drives pricing and there has been interplay between the supply growth and the pricing growth, and we're seeing the strong demand play through on the pricing side. When we get to lapping our efforts on desktop, I do think you're going to  you have a secular trend away from desktop. So that's going be an overall factor in desktop, our ability to grow and maintain the desktop business, so I think that's an underlying factor. We're always going be in a back-and-forth with ad blockers on the desktop side. So I think that's going to constantly be a thing that plays into the desktop revenue. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great, thanks. First off I guess is a follow-up on the earlier video question from Doug. Could you add some perspective on engagement trends with video content and video ads such as average viewing time and whether this mix is what is impacting impression growth? And then more broadly, if you can offer some perspective on how much of the video ad spending on Facebook applications are incremental to television budgets, or if there's any evidence you're seeing of a share shift. Thank you. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. Sure, Colin. I'll take that first one. So impression growth was 32% in Q1, as I noted, and that was a bit slower than in previous quarters. Those of you who have been following us for a while know that periodically we make changes to the product that is going to impact some of the metrics. One of the things that I would call out in Q1 as a contributing factor on the impression growth side was our decision to rank longer-form video higher in News Feed. That means more time in video, and that does come at the expense of some impression growth in News Feed. So I think you do see some interplay there on the impression growth side due to our focus on video. And then Sheryl was going to follow up on the video ad spending. Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. On TV, we are definitely seeing people continue to advertise on TV and use us as a complement. So over time, we believe that the dollar shifts with eyeballs and we want to earn it from our clients and be the best dollar and the best minute they spend and help them measure across channels. I think increasingly, the question is not if you can do without TV, but it's if you can do without mobile. And we're working hard to help advertisers develop the video creative that really works for mobile because that really makes a really big difference. And we think the combination of the creative working for mobile but also the measurement and targeting we can do is a very powerful offer. To share one of my favorite new examples, Subway working with their agency 360i developed video ads and images for Facebook and Instagram to promote the limited time offer Reuben sandwich. And they used Audience Insights, targeting people ages 18 to 49 who purchase meat and cheese, and that's just pretty incredible targeting. Nowhere else I don't think you can actually target that way and people interested in fast food and encourage them to visit Subways. They then used Nielsen Brand Effects and were able to measure a 16-point lift in ad recall and a 5-point lift in intent to visit Subway. So it's a really unique combination of the power of creative that was designed for video for mobile with very specific targeting and very specific measurements. Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge from Cowen. John Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC Thanks, two questions. Mark, you mentioned adding 3,000 reviewers to content at Facebook. Could artificial intelligence be used over time to help solve some of the monitoring? And then just more broadly, how is AI being employed in the processes at the company now versus a couple years ago? And then second item would be, could newer ad units like mid-roll video help mitigate the decel from the lower ad load growth contribution in second half 2017? Thank you. Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. I'll talk to the content and AI questions, and then someone else can talk about the ad piece. The short answer is yes. AI tools over time will be able to do a better job of flagging things for the set of people who are in the Community Ops teams that we can prioritize what we look at. A lot of what we're trying to do here is not just about getting content off Facebook. Last week there was this case where someone was using Facebook Live to broadcast  or was thinking about suicide. And we saw that video and actually didn't take it down and helped get in touch with law enforcement who used that live video to communicate with that person and help save their life. So a lot of what we're trying to do is not just about taking the content down, but also about helping people when they're in need on the platform, and we take that very, very seriously. Over time, the AI tools will get better. Right now there are certain things that AI can do in terms of understanding text and understanding what's in a photo and what's in a video. That will get better over time. That will take a period of years, though, to really reach the quality level that we want. So for a while, our strategy has been to just continue building as good tools as we can because no matter how many people we have on the team, we're never going to be able to look at everything. So that's going be a big challenge. But given the importance of this and how quickly live video is growing, we wanted to make sure that we doubled down on this and made sure we provided as safe of an experience for the community as we can, which is why we're almost doubling the size of the Community Ops team to focus on some of these issues around safety on live video. But over time for sure, more AI will do this, but this is over a period of years. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. John, I think your question then was on Ad Breaks and then the mid-roll type of format. I think there we're testing the ability and are putting short Ad Breaks into longer-form live and on-demand videos. Tests are going well, but it's really early days to talk about that being a significant contributor, so we're working to continue to make those products better and continuing those tests, but it's early. On that front, we're focused on building out the best video experiences for our community and growing longer-form content as a priority. And Ad Breaks is going to allow us to have a monetization strategy with that longer-form content. But like I said, it's early. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great, thank you. I guess I had a question just related to Instagram and Facebook Stories. We've talked a lot about ad load growth over the last year, and Dave's been talking about the pending slowdown, which I think we're all expecting. But how do we think about these new applications or new ways to engage with the apps at the top of your phone, where you're starting to see ad insertion show up as well? Is that thought of as different than the general ad load comments that, Dave, you're making? I'm sorry to split hairs here, but I'm just trying to get a sense of how to think about when they're starting to show up in new places. And then I guess I just had a follow-up for Sheryl. And one question in particular was if there's any measurement metrics that advertisers are asking for now that if you could help them with, it would make them even more eager to shift their budgets over from TV and follow their eyeballs? Sorry, thank you. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. So, Heather, on Stories, again, it's a pretty similar answer, I think, to Ad Breaks in the sense that it's early in terms of using the ads formats in Stories. We've certainly rolled those out. They are not in the ad load calculation per se. So it is different, as you said, from the ad load commentary that I've given. But obviously, it's very early on those products. And then, Sheryl, you had the question about measurement metrics. Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. Yes, we know that measurement is so critical, and we really want to measure core business results and focus on becoming the number one growth driver for our clients. We are continuing to constantly review our metrics. When we find bugs or errors, we're reporting them to our clients and addressing the issue and continuing with that analysis as we work through all of our metrics. We're also very focused on extending measurement partnerships and third-party verification. This last quarter we extended viewability measurement to the Audience Network, added another verification partner, DoubleVerify, for video and display measurement, and introduced our MMM [Marketing Mix Modeling] portal so that we can help people measure across all of the different platforms and compare the effectiveness of their ad spend no matter what their end goal is. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Nomura Instinet. Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet Thank you very much. I have one for Mark and one for Sheryl. Mark, at F8 and in your comments today, you talked about making the camera central to the app, making the camera the first augmented reality platform. I know it's early, but can you maybe share with us your thoughts about the potential commercial application of augmented reality as you see it today? And then, Sheryl, there's been more lately about the use and effectiveness of influencer marketing on both Facebook and Instagram. How is Facebook thinking about sharing in the economics of when brands use celebrities or influencers to market their products using their Facebook posts? Is it by bringing more transactions onto the platform, building on the shopping experience on Facebook? How is Facebook going to share in those economics? Thank you. Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. All right, I can start by talking about augmented reality. The big step forward that we announced at F8 is that there are lots of different apps that have cameras in them or that independent developers just build an app that has a single camera effect. But what we're basically saying is that there's so much innovation and so many different types of effects that people are creating that we don't want developers to have to build their own separate app and get to a huge scale in order to build some new kind of visual tool. So we built  we're making the cameras inside the whole family of apps into the first augmented reality platform, into an open platform, which is different from what any other app that has a camera has done before. It's going to open up a much greater diversity of use cases, not only making it so that use cases like facemasks or style transfers that we already have, you're now going to have thousands of options instead of just 10 or 20 at a time. But there are also going to be all these new kinds of things that we're not even building today that developers will be able to experiment with. One of the examples I showed at F8 was around using object recognition and computer vision to be able to point your camera at something and then tap on it and get a card of information and maybe even a buy button. So there are lots of different ways that over time this kind of content is going to both augment existing real-world objects and eventually replace them, which I think is going to be an interesting opportunity. maybe not on augmented reality on the phone but on glasses eventually. When you have that, I think we're going get to a point where things like TVs, you no longer need a physical TV. You'll get a $1 app that you can watch it screen on. And it will just be an interesting exercise to see how many of the things that we have that are physical things don't actually need to be physical in that world, and how much innovation that opens up for independent developers all around the world. A lot of people don't have a factory, so they can't build a TV. But think about how many kids and different developers around the world, kids sitting in dorm rooms and all these different places are going be able to create things that today they couldn't. So I hope this is going to create a pretty interesting economy. So a lot of that stuff is pretty far out, five, ten years. But we want to be pushing this forward. I think we're a little bit late to the trend initially around making cameras the center of how sharing works. But I do think at this point, we're pretty much ahead in terms of the technology that we're building, and making it an open platform I think is a big is a big step forward. A lot of people are using these products across our family of apps, and I would expect us to continue leading the way forward on this from this point on. Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. When you think about influencer marketing, we definitely see publishers interested in it, brands interested in it. And so we've worked on branded content, the ability to tag a sponsor and share posts and insights. And the financial arrangement remains between the sponsor and the publisher. It's early, but we're seeing some positive results with publishers of many different types bringing branded content to Facebook. In Q1, we opened this up to unverified pages so we could enable more people to take advantage of this kind of targeting. We see this in the broader context of better targeting. When you think about what really drives great performance for both people who are using Facebook but for marketers, it's well-targeted ads. And so influencer marketing is one way to get there, but we're focused on a very full range of ability to target well. We've been really pleased with the adoption of our targeting products from Custom Audiences to Lookalikes to Dynamic Ads, and we think all of these can improve the relevance of the ad by making ads more targeted, because when they're more targeted, they have higher returns for marketers and they're more enjoyable or relevant for people. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC Great, thanks. First, I think it's a great move to go all-in GAAP in terms of reporting. Second, David, when you talked about the ads, your ad load commentary, I couldn't tell if there was a subtle shift there when you were saying that the ad load pressure would occur after the end of the year rather than in the second half of the year. And then third, this is for Sheryl and Mark. The recent stories about gender bias amongst engineers at Facebook, and I know you quickly responded to that and said if there were anything, there may be a rank bias, but in my mind it creates the opportunity potentially for Facebook to better tap into what is probably underappreciated female engineering talent in the Valley and across technology. How do you think about that as an opportunity for the company? Thank you. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. I'll just real quickly address the ad load issue, Mark. Sorry if it wasn't clear, really no change in outlook there. We continue to expect that we'll see deceleration in ad revenue growth. And that's going to be particularly pronounced as we get into the second half of 2017 because ad load will be a less significant factor driving growth starting in the second half. Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. On the issue you raised with the Facebook female engineers, I'm really glad to have a chance to address this because this is an issue I take very seriously. On the specific report on this study, the study was conducted by a former employee with very incomplete data. When that study was shared with people internally, and we have that culture where people do studies and share things, and we're really glad because that helps surface issues, we immediately conducted our own research using the full data. And what we found is that the main reason code was sent back at different rates was not correlated with gender. It was correlated with level, and the fact that we have more male senior engineers was explaining it. If you compared male and female engineers at the same level, there was not this discrepancy. Then that leads to the obvious question is are you promoting men and women at the same rate and the broader question of are you paying men and women fairly. And we do a comprehensive look at that every single promotion and pay and performance cycle we have, which is six months. And we know that we're promoting men and women at the same rate as men. Now that said, our industry still has issues and we still have issues. We don't have enough senior female engineers. We don't have enough women going into computer science, and we take this very seriously, from the work we've done with LinkedIn to get CS&E Lean In circles all over college campuses, to encourage more women and under-represented minorities to come into our field. We've had a really nice program in extra internships where we're taking people who are not yet majoring in computer science but we think have the ability, and teaching them for a summer and seeing them return, to the work we're doing with our female engineers to make sure that all forms of bias are surfaced and eliminated. And we can continue to use the full talents of the population. Nothing is more important to us. Operator Your next question comes from the line Ross Sandler from Barclays. Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Just had two questions on video. We know it's early, but what kind of traction do you see with the video tab that's in beta? And do you think longer term the video consumption is going to be in that dedicated tab, or will it stay in the News Feed based on what you're seeing right now? And then, Dave, just to follow up on your previous answers, so are the costs related to video ad rev share or licensing of video content, is that baked into your OpEx guidance for 2017, or is that something that will step up after this year? Thank you. Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. I don't know if we have any public stats on the video tab, probably not. But in terms of the strategy, I can talk about that quickly. There were two basic use cases for checking in with Facebook and seeing what's going on in the world. What people do with News Feed a lot of the time is they have a few free minutes, or you want to sit down for maybe a longer session to see everything that's going on in the world. You don't have a specific intention to watch a specific type of content. You just want to check in and see what's going on in the world. There's this whole other use case around content, which is going to the app or sitting down at a TV because there's some content that you want to watch and you want to go directly to it. And that's what we're trying to do with the video tab, to make it so that all the different folks, whether they're pages that you follow or creators that you like, who you want to subscribe to and get the updates to what they're doing, that you have a place that you can go to with more intent to consume that content. The reason why it needs to be a different tab or at least a different service from News Feed is because people come to it with a different intent. I think you're going to start in the future getting people coming to Facebook for the News Feed use case of checking in and people coming with an intent to go to the video tab to watch a specific video. So that's what we're doing there. That's the strategy, and I guess we'll update on stats when we have them. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. And, Ross, on the costs related to the video ad rev share, yes, our guidance on total cost is all-inclusive, so it includes all the R&D investments we're making. It includes the content. It includes things like the Community Operations investments that we talked about today in the announcement. But I would say that the nature of the types of video content deals that we're doing will make them more likely to show up after 2017. So there will be some content expense in 2017, but I think it will be something you will see step up after 2017. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mark May from Citi. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you. Mark, in your prepared remarks, you talked about doing more to foster local communities and groups, and it would seem like one of the more interesting test cases here already is in Local Marketplaces. I was just wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about the kind of adoption and engagement that you've seen with Local Marketplaces and maybe anything that you've learned that you can apply to some of the newer initiatives that you're looking at? And then secondly, probably for Sheryl, for Ad Breaks to scale, it appears that content creators need to adapt their programming for this, and of course, users need to engage with the ads. So I guess the question is how are completion rates for Ad Breaks? I know it's early, but what are you seeing so far? And how would you characterize the willingness of content creators to adapt? Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. I can talk about Marketplace Groups first. So I think your basic point is right, that the reason why we started working on Marketplace and the tab around that is because when we were exploring what the biggest use cases were of Groups, we uncovered that a very large number of people, hundreds of millions, use Groups to buy and sell different things. And so these whole communities have formed, which was somewhat surprising to us honestly, because we hadn't developed that product specifically for buying and selling. It was for group communication and that's what people were using it for. So we decided hey, we're going to put together a team that's going to invest in making this actually good for buying and selling and see how much we can grow that economy. So I don't know that we have any public stats on that yet, but that's an area that I'm certainly very excited about. And then in terms of local communities, one of the big trends in the world that we've seen is just that participation in all kinds of different physical communities, whether they're sports teams or some religious groups or different kinds of different things, have been declining a lot over the past several decades. And that I think is a big social issue that is eroding the social fabric of the whole society, not just our country, but around the world. And that's one where I look at that and I wonder if Facebook can play a role in helping to strengthen that. We look at  there are more than 1 billion people every month who use our Groups product. But if you think about your own use of the Groups product, you probably are a member of a bunch of different groups that you maybe check in on very infrequently. So that's very different from  there's a handful of people, around 100 million or a bit more, who are a member of what we call a very meaningful group. So that could be a parenting group or you're diagnosed with a rare disease, and you can now connect with people all around the world to share stories around that. These are groups that upon joining, they become one of the things that you spend the most time with on Facebook, one of the most important parts of your experience, and a really fundamental part of your real-world support structure. So we look that that and we ask the question of hey, if 100 million people are in those very meaningful groups today, can we get that to be 1 billion people over next several years? And if so, then that can help reverse some of the decline in community membership and help strengthen the social fabric, not only in our country, but around the world. So that's a big part of what we're focused on across a number of different initiatives. Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. And I'll talk a little bit about the Ad Break, what we're seeing. It's really early both in terms of testing the ads and getting any feedback from users, so people who use Facebook, so we don't have that data to share. But we're pleased that the test is active. We're pleased that it's going well and that we can do both live and uploaded videos. We think over time that marketers will follow where people are spending their time. And if the ads can be well-targeted, we think we'll be able to see engagement, and we already see that. When ads are really well targeted and taking full advantage of the kind of targeting we offer, so you're showing people something they want to see, we see engagement that we think is really critical. It's also worth noting that the metrics that really matter at the end are driving sales. And so any of the engagement with ad metrics, whether it's remembering an ad going back to  people have been measuring that for a long time too, how long a video ad is viewed, are only proxy metrics. What matters is the impact on sales. And so we think the better we can do at getting the measurement to what actually matters, which is the end behavior marketers are trying to drive, the more people will shift their focus to business metrics, the better it will be for the returns they get and ultimately our business. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC Thanks. I have three philosophical questions on video for you guys. Anyone can grab them. The first is, it was interesting to see the NFL games go from Twitter to Amazon. I wonder. Do the NFL games fit with your video strategy, and why or why not? That's one. Two is, I know the model is revenue share, but a lot of the more traditional companies would like a license fee or the ability to sell their own inventory on your platform. Is that something you'd consider? And last but not least, the question about monetization, why is mid-roll optimal to pre-roll, and can you share anything about the testing of that concept? Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. I can talk about sports. So in terms of experimenting with different content, I think we'll try a number of different things here. In terms of working with folks to produce all kinds of content, sports is probably something that we'll want to try at some point. But again, like Dave said before, the goal is going to be creating some anchor content initially that helps people learn that going to the video tab that that's a great destination where they can explore and come to Facebook with the intent to watch the videos that they want. And then the long-term goal is actually not to be paying for specific content like that, but doing a revenue share model once the whole economy around video on Facebook is built up. But we're working on that, and I think we'll probably look at different pieces of content like this around the world, but at this point don't feel like any specific one of them is a must-have for us. David M. Wehner - Facebook, Inc. And I think Mark touched on the question of business model here, and our focus really is on revenue share. We'll be investing to kick-start the ecosystem with content, so derisking it for some of our content partners to start off with, but the focus is really to build a rev-share model over time that's sustainable. That's the focus as opposed to other models. In terms of why mid-roll is preferable to pre-roll, Facebook is well suited for shorter-form content where we're ranking things to be longer-form as well. So we're ranking longer-form video, but that's still relatively short video views. And for that reason, we think mid-roll is a better user experience. Deborah Crawford - Facebook, Inc. Operator, I think we have time for one last question. Operator Your last question comes from the line of Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo. Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks very much, one for Sheryl. Sheryl, you talked a lot about the targeting advantage of Facebook, and you have a number of data signals and sources informing that. I'm wondering if you could talk about the relative importance of collecting signals on the platform versus off the platform, for instance, the behavior of Facebook users interacting with third-party websites. Is this the depth of your off-platform collection? Is this a significant competitive advantage for you? Thank you very much. Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. We think that targeting end measurement are significant competitive advantages for us. We're very focused on the privacy of what people do, wherever they do it, and using the information we have in a very responsible way. We believe that because people are sharing interests, because people are themselves their real identity on the Facebook platform, we have a significant advantage just in basic targeting itself. Just age and gender, we're 38% more accurate than broad-based targeting according to Nielsen in the U.S., and that's just age and gender. And then if you think about some of the key studies I shared, targeting people who purchase a certain item, targeting people who are interested in a certain item, we think that's very substantial. We also think that there's a real competitive advantage in focusing on business results, as we have. We're really working on shifting people to understanding what their real objectives are so that they can focus on driving businesses. At the end of the day, when you show an ad, you want to move a product off a lot, off a shelf, into a shopping cart, whether it's online or offline, and that's where our focus is and will continue to be. Deborah Crawford - Facebook, Inc. Great, thank you again, everybody, for joining us today. We appreciate your time, and we look forward to speaking with you again.
