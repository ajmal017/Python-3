So with that, let me turn the call over to Mike. Michael Gregoire Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I am very pleased to report our strong fiscal fourth quarter performance. It was the best sales execution we’ve seen in our fourth quarter in well over a decade. There is no doubt we ended fiscal year 2017 with solid momentum. Our strong fourth quarter performance enabled us to deliver most metrics at the high end of our full year guidance ranges. In fiscal 2017, we achieved total revenue growth for the first time since fiscal 2012. Importantly, we did this while maintaining healthy operating margins and cash flow generation. Now we are positioning CA for our next phase, which we believe will accelerate our growth trajectory over time. Turning to our Q4 results. Our revenue, new sales, EPS and CFFO were at or above our expectations. The highlight was the strength we saw in new sales across both our Enterprise Solutions and our Mainframe segments. In ES, healthy new sales growth was broad-based and was particularly robust across API Management, Agile Central, Security and our Continuous Delivery portfolio, with exceptionally strong results in our test data management business. In Mainframe, new sales grew meaningfully. It is not surprising that capacity sales declined from the year ago period given where we are in the hardware refresh cycle. But our Mainframe new sales performance in the quarter demonstrates how well customers are embracing our new innovations on the platform. In the quarter, strength in Mainframe new sales was driven by organically developed products like Data Content Discovery or DCD, as well as Mainframe Operational Intelligence or MOI. Overall, our Q4 performance was driven by the great execution of our Platinum sales team. They did a very good job of capitalizing on a large renewal portfolio. Results from our North America Platinum and Public Sector teams were particularly strong. The renewal yield in the quarter was in the low 90s, inline with our longer term target, and new sales were up dramatically. Our Named and Growth, or partner-led sales organizations also delivered healthy double-digit new sales growth in the quarter. I am pleased to report that the integration of our Automic acquisition is progressing well. And, we enthusiastically welcome Veracode to the team. We are really excited about the quality of the products and most importantly the quality of the people at both Automic and Veracode. These strategically important acquisitions substantially strengthen the growing portion of our ES portfolio. For the full year, we delivered results broadly at the higher end of our guidance ranges. Revenue, EPS and CFFO were above the mid-point of the guidance ranges we provided for the full year. Operating margin came inline and reflects the absorption of acquisition related expenses associated with Automic and Veracode. Notably, for the full year, our ES revenue grew organically, which is a marked improvement over prior years. Our Mainframe segment delivered consistently solid performance through the year. For the year, Mainframe performed at the better end of our expectations. We believe our relative outperformance can be attributed to a few things. Our Mainframe business unit was an early adopter of the Agile methodology. This has resulted in the completion of nearly 40 releases in the past year with zero defects. This level of product quality is important to all customers, but is most important to our customers running mission critical applications. CA continues to invest meaningfully in the mainframe platform. We believe we offer a broader, more innovative, and cost competitive portfolio of solutions. We are also able to leverage our ES development as well as recent acquisitions to provide unique integrations and truly cross platform solutions that help customers solve complex challenges. Our broad, solutions-based portfolio enables us to provide customers with compelling, cost competitive offerings. For example, one of the largest retailers in the United States made the decision to partner with us to support its retail, corporate systems, credit cards and dotcom property. Our portfolio of innovative solutions is enabling them to simplify their IT environment, narrow their supplier base, and reduce their cost. In conjunction with our partners and our customers’ IT operations team, we are helping to deliver a seamless migration to seven key CA solutions in less than 90 days. Looking ahead, we believe our partnership with IBM on IBM Cloud Managed Services on z Systems, commonly referred to as zCloud, provides us with a great opportunity to help customers realize the benefit of the cloud while running mission critical, security rich mainframe workloads. This partnership enables CA to provide value to customers that have smaller MIPS consumption where the fixed costs of running a mainframe platform is challenging. It also gives the option to larger customers to move CapEx to OpEx by turning mainframe capacity into a service, similar to AWS or Azure. These dynamics have the potential to enable CA to capture incremental market segment share over time. When I look at our business overall, I can confidently say that we are in a good place. We are in a great businesses and we have absolutely improved our execution. In this industry, we can never rest on last quarter’s performance. But when I pause for a moment and look back at the work our teams have done, we have made outstanding progress. First and foremost, CA was recently named one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies in 2017 by Ethisphere Institute. This is the second year in a row that CA has received this honor, which recognizes companies that lead with integrity and align principles with action. We at CA take great pride in this recognition that we believe is a reflection of the culture and priorities we have cultivated over the last few years. I’m also pleased that our heightened focus on customer success is reflected in the significant improvement we’re seeing in our NPS or Net Promoter Score. This is a standardized measure of customers’ willingness to recommend our products to other potential customers. In fiscal 2017, our NPS scores across both our ES and Mainframe segments moved up considerably. The spirit of innovation within CA is alive and well. Throughout the organization, our teams understand that organic innovation is critical and is at the heart of our strategy. The budding success of our CA Accelerator, which is our internal VC like technology incubator, is certainly helping. In this framework, successful ideas become solutions and begin to build momentum with customers. The objective for these innovations is to exit the CA Accelerator into the product organization. The first graduate from the CA Accelerator to the CPO organization is a common analytics engine that can be utilized by both Mainframe and our Enterprise Solutions segment. Companywide, CA was granted 186 patents in FY '17, up from 157 in the prior year. Meanwhile, the product portfolio continues to improve. Our products are becoming easier to install, upgrade and manage. And we are pleased to report that our solutions continue to earn recognition from major industry analysts. For example, in Q4 CA was named a Leader by Gartner in its 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Governance and Administration. We are listening to our customers. This is resulting in improved NPS scores, better products and more efficient business practices. We are furthering our commitment to deliver solutions in a way customers increasingly prefer to buy. We’re working to accelerate the velocity of products like Agile Central and Blazemeter. Looking ahead, we are optimizing our internal processes to build, sell, and monetize our subscription based products more systematically, with higher velocity and with greater efficiency. This includes building out a common set of best practices, metrics, and business architecture across our SaaS solutions. Similarly, we are optimizing the way in which we go to market. As mentioned last quarter, we’ve observed that our largest Named accounts have preferences and behaviors much like our Platinum customers. At the same time, the investments we’ve made in our partner channel and our digital sales over the past few years has started to gain momentum. This allows us to now reduce the complexity of our customer stratification. Going forward, we are migrating the Platinum, Named and Growth nomenclature towards two sales groups, Enterprise and Commercial. This aligns with our growing portfolio of next generation software solutions, and it aligns with how our existing and prospective customers transact. The Enterprise sales team will encompass what has been known as Platinum, in addition to the largest 30% or so of the Named sales group. We believe this will enable us to drive deeper penetration in our largest Fortune 2000 opportunities. The Commercial sales group will absorb the smaller Named customers and will be entirely served by digital sales and partners. We believe this will enable us to cost effectively serve a much broader set of potential customers globally. Ultimately, we expect this to propel a lower cost, higher velocity go to market strategy for CA over time. This is an exciting time at CA. This industry is moving quickly and so are we. We’ve made incredible progress and as we look toward the next phase of this company’s evolution, in many ways we are just getting started. As we enter FY'18 and beyond, we are pivoting to enter our next phase as a company that delivers sustainable, long-term growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Kieran to review our fourth quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you. Kieran McGrath Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported, unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon I’m going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. As Mike had previously mentioned, we were very pleased with our sales execution in the fourth quarter. Q4 total new sales increased in the low 40s, while renewals increased in the low 50s. As we have stated on prior earnings calls, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis, due to the timing and duration of large transactions. Automic contributed approximately mid-single digits to total new sales growth in the fourth quarter. Our Q4 renewal yield was in the low 90s, in line with our longer term expectations. In Q4, new sales in all regions were up as reported and in constant currency except EMEA, where new sales were flat as reported and up in constant currency, including the contribution from the Automic acquisition. Within our segments, Q4 Mainframe new sales increased in the low 40s, despite lower capacity sales which likely reflects the timing of the hardware cycle. Mainframe new sales performance was driven by organically developed products like Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operational Intelligence. Q4 Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the low 40s and mid 40s in constant currency. As Mike mentioned, the strong performance in this segment was driven by products like API Management, Agile Central, Security and our Continuous Delivery products, all of which saw meaningful improvement on a year-over-year basis. Automic contributed approximately high single digits to Enterprise Solutions new sales growth in the quarter. For the full year, total new sales were up approximately 10%, with Enterprise Solutions new sales up high single digits and Mainframe Solutions new sales up in the mid teens. Acquisitions contributed approximately high single digits to Enterprise Solutions new sales growth and mid-single digits to total new sales growth for the full year. Even without acquisitions, total new sales would have grown for the full year. Our renewal portfolio for fiscal 2017 was up in the mid-teens, and our renewal yield was in the low 90s in each of the four quarters. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.01 billion, flat as reported and up 1% in constant currency. Q4 Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 5% as reported and up 6% in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 2% as reported and down 1% in constant currency, and Services was down 6% as reported and down 5% in constant currency. Automic contributed 2 points as reported and 3 points in constant currency to total revenue growth in our fourth fiscal quarter. More specifically, Automic contributed approximately 6 points to Enterprise Solutions revenue growth and approximately 4 points to Services revenue in the quarter. For the full year, total revenue was $4.04 billion, flat as reported and up 1% in constant currency. As a reminder, our fiscal 2017 results include one quarter of inorganic contribution from our 2016 acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium, in addition to our more recent acquisition of Automic. Fiscal 2017 Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 5%, Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 1%, and Services revenue was down 8% as reported and down 7% in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed approximately 2 points to total revenue growth for the full year. Acquisitions contributed approximately 3 points to Enterprise Solutions revenue growth and approximately 3 points to Services revenue for the full year. Total revenue backlog increased 11% as reported, and 12% in constant currency, while current revenue backlog increased 4% as reported, and 6% in constant currency, inclusive of Automic and Veracode. As we’ve said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow with more consistency as we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield. Fourth quarter GAAP operating margin was 21%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, in line with our expectations. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 59% for Mainframe Solutions and 1% for Enterprise Solutions. As typical, our Q4 margins were lower. In addition to higher seasonal expenses, an increased level of commissions paid from higher new sales generated in the period negatively impacted Mainframe Solutions segment operating margin in Q4. Enterprise solutions operating margins, which are typically seasonally lower in Q4, were also adversely impacted by non-recurring expenses related to our acquisitions of Automic and Veracode. In addition, segment margin was impacted by increased level of commission expense commensurate with new sales growth. Services margin was negative 3%. As we’ve discussed in the past, as our product portfolio has evolved and our solutions are becoming easier to install and to manage, fewer services are required. This has resulted in contraction of this structurally lower margin segment. Our fourth quarter segment margin reflects the continuation of our actions to better align the cost structure with our expected Services revenue run rate going forward. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the fourth quarter were approximately 21% and 25%, respectively. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.38, down 7%. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.54, down 10% as reported and down 12% in constant currency. For the full year, our GAAP operating margin was 28%, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 37%. Fiscal 2017 segment operating margins were 61% for Mainframe Solutions, 11% for Enterprise Solutions, and breakeven for Services. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate for the full year was approximately 28%. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year was $1.85, up 4% as reported and up 2% in constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year was $2.48, up 2% as reported and up 1% in constant currency. Q4 CFFO was $419 million, down 11%. CFFO in the quarter was impacted by the GSA settlement. We paid $49 million inclusive of legal fees in the quarter, to settle a longstanding matter brought against us by the DOJ and an individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government as previously announced. Single installment cash collections were $176 million in the quarter, up $46 million from the year-ago period. For the full year, CFFO was $1.04 billion, flat as reported and up 3% in constant currency. CFFO exceeded our expectations due to a higher level of single installment cash collections. Separately, we issued $850 million in investment grade bonds, primarily to fund our acquisition of Veracode. We issued a five-year $500 million tranche at 3.6% and a 10-year $350 million tranche at 4.7%. We are very pleased with the terms and are comfortable with the tenor of our corporate debt. We ended Q4 with approximately $157 million in net debt. During the quarter, we paid $107 million in dividends. Due to the acquisition of Veracode and the bond offering, we did not buy back stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect to resume our share repurchases in the near-term with the intention to generally at least offset dilution. We have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. Now, turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was March 31st, 2017. It includes the impact of the Veracode acquisition and includes the incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of senior notes in March. No additional material acquisitions are assumed. For the full year, we expect total revenue to increase 2% to 3% as reported and to increase 3% to 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.12 billion to $4.17 billion. This guidance contemplates our expectation that the overall mainframe market will decline in the low single digits over the medium term, consistent with what we’ve said in the past. We expect full year GAAP operating margin between 26% to 27% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 36%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be between 28% and 29%. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to decrease 10% to 7% as reported, and to decrease 8% to 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.67 to $1.72. This includes a $0.06 impact from the incremental interest expense associated with our March 2017 bond offering. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to decrease 5% to 3% as reported and to decrease 4% to 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.35 to $2.40. Again, this includes a $0.06 impact from the incremental interest expense from our bond offering, mentioned previously. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding, and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be in a range of down 2% to up 2%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.05 billion to $1.10 billion. The incremental interest expense from the bond offering impacts CFFO by approximately $33 million. Our cash flow from operations guidance includes our adoption of ASU 2016-09, titled Improvements to Employee Shared-Based Payment Accounting. The adoption of this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 requires us to present taxes paid in connection with employee stock within cash flows from financing activities, rather than payments within cash flows from operations. The adoption of this accounting standard will be presented retrospectively and is not expected to impact the year-over-year percentage change. With regard to Q1, please keep in mind that we renewed a large system integrator in the June quarter of fiscal 2017. This creates a very difficult year-over-year compare that will be particularly evident in our Q1 renewal bookings and new sales. Additionally, the impact from the acquisitions and related integration expenses will be most impactful in the first two quarters of the year, particularly in Q1. For the full year, we expect the size of the portfolio to be renewed to be down in the high teens compared to the year ago period. Even excluding the impact of the large SI we renewed in Q1 last year, our renewal portfolio for fiscal 2018 is back-end loaded. We expect this to heavily influence the linearity of bookings throughout the year. To provide an update on ASC 606, the upcoming revenue recognition standard, as you will see in our 10-K filing tomorrow, we expect this change in the revenue recognition standard will have a material impact on our reported financial statements. Specifically, we expect that the point in time rather than ratable recognition of license revenue will increase the variability in our quarterly reported results. However, we do not expect that the change in standard will significantly impact the way in which we recognize revenue from maintenance, SaaS and professional services contracts. And we do not expect it will meaningfully impact customer billings or cash collections from customer billings. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASC 606 on cash tax payments. In general, we do not expect the economic value of our transactions to change as a result of ASC 606. We plan to adopt ASC 606 in our first quarter of fiscal 2019, and we are continuing to evaluate the transition method we will use. As we work through the changes coming with ASC 606, we are also exploring ways in which we can improve the transparency and simplicity of the metrics we provide on a regular basis to best reflect the ongoing performance of our business. In summary, we are pleased with our performance in Q4 where we met or exceeded our expectations across most financial metrics. As we look ahead to fiscal 2018 and beyond, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our long-term goal of sustainable growth. With that, we’ll open it up for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open. Raimo Lenschow Two if I may. First of all, Mike, can you talk a little bit about when you see a new sales perform better than renewals. That’s my first and I have one quick follow up then. Michael Gregoire Sure. Well, thank you, Raimo. Actually for FY '17, if you exclude the mainframe capacity, new sales growth exceeded the growth in the renewal portfolio. And given our improved product portfolio, we believe new sales should be significantly better than the renewal portfolio this year in FY '18. I think that statement should be true on an organic basis as well. Raimo Lenschow Okay. Perfect. Really that sounds like you have turned a corner. And can I talk about the -- you mentioned the changes in the sales organization. I mean it's like enterprise commercial kind of seems to make a lot of sense. How much disruption should we get? Should we kind of expect from that or is it kind of all done and can you talk through that a little bit? Michael Gregoire Yes. I expect no disruption in it. The people who are covering accounts are covering the same accounts. We have moved some of the smaller accounts what we call commercial. And this has been something we have been working at for a couple of years as we have tried to improve the commercial segment. We finally felt coming out of Q3, Q4 performance that they were mature enough, had enough process and experience where they could service those customers. That coupled with the portfolio, as you know we have been rapidly moving towards more SaaS solution. Try and buy, lend and extend. Those solutions lend themselves well in those sales. And then strategically, as we know that our enterprise portfolio will relatively midterm, exceed the mainframe portfolio, we have to take into consideration our cost structure on sales and try to use a very expense sales force at a segment of the market that could easily be served by a broader sales force, is in the best interest for CA, both tactically and strategically. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Matt Hedberg Automic did a lot better than I think you guys had thought. I am curious, Mike, what drove that outperformance. Was it conservative assumptions or was it just a lot of broad net new sales that you saw in the quarter. Michael Gregoire Yes. I think it's a couple of things. First, a lot of net new [raw] [ph] sales couple with the fact it was their year-end, so their sales professionals have been working on deals and that all came together at the end of their quarter. And the secondly, customers that were evaluating multiple providers, the strength of the CA brand and ability to service customers on a global basis as well as the ability to link other products into their portfolio, gave then a strategic view into what the future could look like as they try to automate their whole infrastructure. So I think it was a combination of those three things that gave a little bit of up performance but I definitely want to hand off a lot of congratulations to the Automic team. They really went after the quarter with a lot of gusto. Matt Hedberg That’s helpful. Thank you. And then Kieran, I am curious on 606. It sounds like we will see more tomorrow. I am curious though, can you provide a little bit more color on potentially the impact to reported revenue. I guess the license component. Anything you can kind of help us out with a little bit more color on that. Kieran McGrath I think, Matt, it's a little premature on that for me to start giving specifics on it. But as you can well expect, we are a business that has been very primarily ratable, very small amount of upfront revenue, you can see that within the SFO accounts that we have. So converting the license content which is obviously quite material in both the ES and mainframe business. We will add volatility in any one given quarter. We think it's more than [indiscernible] over time. The length of time, maybe somewhat debatable but I think that’s what we are in the process of really sizing here. And what we are looking at -- are really looking for metrics that we will be able to add to the top line reported numbers to try and give a sense of the continuity in the business as we move through time. That said, when we pull back and we take a look at our ability to bill our customers and collect the cash markup from this, we don’t see anything there. And quite frankly, we are not making changes to or contractual relationships to our customer. The customer is at the center of our business and we don’t think it's right to go and impact the customers with changes that are being driven by accounting. And from what we can see right now, we don’t think that true, fundamental economics are going to change although license in any given period will be more volatile. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is now open. John DiFucci So guys, bookings were very strong. Even if you normalize for duration, I think bookings were up something in the double digits. Mike, you mentioned the strong renewals and strong lease sales and you also doubled the number of large deals. So I guess I have two questions. One, and I know your deals, like we try to model when they are supposed to renew. And I know that gets missed around a lot. So I am just curious, were there more deals that were signed early, more than normal. I know that happens every quarter. Did that happen this quarter? And then secondly, it sounds like your catching of new business to renewals is working really well and that’s great. So how is progress in signing new deals outside of a renewal cycle, whether it's with existing customers or new customers? Michael Gregoire Sure. Well, first, we didn’t naturally pull any deals forward in Q4, so that was pretty much standard practice, nothing outstanding or nothing special there. The new business inside the renewal, it's just a function of the quality of the products. I think we have almost everyone of our products either up in the Magic Quadrant or in the highest ranking of our top eight new focus products. So those products are very attractive to our customer and we have a sales team that intimately understands these customers, especially the large ones, John, as you all know, and having great products being sold in to, with those renewals. It was bigger than we probably anticipated but I would credit that with the quality of the products and the interesting nature of the solution that how the solutions work together. We also had uptick in volume in sales outside of the renewal portfolio. So more deals. But if you think about how the market is buying, it is try and buy, it is lend and expand. So you are going to see more transaction volume. I think it was the biggest transaction volume we have ever had for net new clients. The size of the transactions are relatively small compared to what we would sell into the renewal base. And I think over time, the lend and expand, those now are footprints for expand. Kieran, maybe you have a thought on that as well? Kieran McGrath Just one other point. So, John, if you recall, in prior quarters we had advised that we thought the renewal portfolio for this year was going to be up in the high teens. In fact, we kind of [indiscernible] rounding, we actually ended up in the mid-teens. So I think that’s pretty clear evidence that we really didn’t see any unnatural pull forward of any significant amount of deals that we hadn't been forecasting. So that’s clear. I think, Mike, you hit it right on the head, we are starting to see, especially with a lot of our SaaS businesses, we are seeing something like Blazemeter here, which is all done to digital sales. Just the volume is really exploding from that side of the business at once again is a very, relatively smaller price point. Michael Gregoire Is that helpful, John? John DiFucci Yes. That’s really helpful, guys. And just one, I guess follow up, Mike. So is that part of what's giving you the confidence, from the first question, from Raimo's question about the new sales this year is just volume of some of the try to buy, try before you buy or lend and expand type strategy. Michael Gregoire Yes. Of that end, we have put four products, net new organic products in the market that generated over $50 million in sales in relatively short period of time. I have four new SaaS products that come out in the next, that are all organically built. That is right in the confines of our strategy, making our portfolio work a little bit closer together. So it's a combination of good sales execution and really strong products that seems to be coming together for us. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Due to no response we will go to the next question. And our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Philip Winslow Obviously, you got a stronger quarter about new sales and renewals and I appreciate the commentary that you guys gave on the renewal portfolio. Just wanted to dig into those. First, Mike, just in terms of the renewal rates that’s you are seeing from a dollar perspective on the renewal side. Any sort of change, up or down, that you note there? And then also you mentioned that the renewals portfolio will be down this coming year and more backend loaded. I wonder if you can give us some more color in terms of just the waiting there for first half, second half. Michael Gregoire Sure. The renewal rate was pretty much the same that we have seen quarter-over-quarter. So no new changes there. Kieran has got his finger tightly on the pulse of the backlog and how the renewals are working, so I will let him answer that question. Kieran McGrath Sure. So as we think about, obviously we have our -- in the first quarter of this year, we have a pretty big difficult compare against a deal we had with an outsourcer in the first quarter of last year. So that’s going to really make the renewals on the new sales a very difficult compare in Q1. As we go through the rest of the year, I mean that starts to flatten out and even be up a little bit in the last part of the year. So for the whole of the year, as I said in my script, we are going to be down on a year-over-year basis in the high teens. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits Two questions regarding acquisition. One, Mike, obviously this has been a very aggressive couple of years in terms of the dollar amount and [indiscernible]. 12 of the 300 million to 500 million bogie. So maybe if you could tell me how you are feeling at this point in terms of the -- next couple of years. Michael Gregoire Sure. Michael, you are breaking up a little bit. I think you are just saying how are we feeling now? Kieran McGrath I think you were asking about acquisitions, Michael. Michael Turits Yes. Sorry, headset malfunction there. Yes, acquisition were above, obviously $1.5 billion to $2 billion in last couple of years, above the $300 million to $500 million bogie, thoughts on the pace going forward? Michael Gregoire Sure. If I had my way in the world, what I would love to do is digest these acquisitions that we made. We are very excited about them. But as you know, acquisitions take work and I have always preferred, given my choice to do smaller acquisitions, in the $50 million to $80 million range, that have good base technology that needs organic engineering from us to get those products the scale and then put it through our marketing and distribution engines. Unfortunately, we don’t get to chose how these things work. If you take a look at Automic, for example. That was a two year quoting period and it finally came to conclusion. It just so happened that Veracode which we have been looking at for a long period of time, that happened in a relatively near time frame to Automic. Given my choice, I would have rather spread those out over time. But when you have an opportunity at properties like that, it's a price that we feel is right for value, you want to be able to execute. Now having said that, I think that our view on value is probably going to get a little tougher because we don’t feel we need to be out in the market. Now if something that was extraordinary was to come along, we would like the flexibility to go ahead and do that. But right now, I would like to digest what we have and just keep our eyes wide open for small tuck-ins that fit our strategy and hope that nothing material hits the market that we are really interested in. Michael Turits Okay. And then you guys gave lots of help to us in terms of doing organic calculations. So really appreciate that. Just one, I don’t think you necessarily gave on the current revenue backlog which I believe is up 6% constant currency. Was that roughly five points from acquisition, because obviously that’s being going positive, something we are trying to closely monitor? Michael Gregoire Yes. So of the six points of constant currency, about half of it, three points was related to Veracode which as you know we closed on the absolute last day of the quarter and then Automic. And then the other portion, the other half was related to just the timing of the renewal portfolio that comes due here in fiscal '18, as well as the Q4 new sales. Michael Turits So you are saying it's three points only from acquisitions that’s inorganic in that’s six points. Michael Gregoire That’s correct. Michael Turits Okay. Thanks. I guess, if I squeeze one in. So does that feel though, I mean you said there is some timing. I mean this has been a big deal to talk about, one you felt like that was turning up in a sustainable way. So are those timing issues suggesting that that is not the turn or you think it might be? Michael Gregoire You know I like to hit it straight down the middle with you guys. When the number was flat or slightly negative, I kept reminding you that as the renewal portfolio, there was a lot up for renewal in fiscal '17, that that would influence, in a negative way, the current backlog and similarly as we have a lot of activity stretching out over time, it kind of goes the other way. All that said, I am very happy where we ended the quarter from a position perspective on the revenue backlog. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is now open. Daniel Greenfield Daniel Greenfield on for Kirk. Two quick questions. Mike, can you provide just a bit more color on the improvement in sales execution this quarter and just kind of why you believe that can continue into FY '18? And then Kieran, can you just remind us of the assumed impact from Automic and Veracode on revenue guidance for FY '18? And are you going to call out the contribution from these deals individually going forward or just the total impact on revenue and profitability? Thanks. Michael Gregoire Well, with respect to sales execution, I think it comes down to having great products in a business model that sales professionals understand and a marketing team that has done a much much better job being able to articulate not only the strategy of our company and each one of our segments, but how the products work as a single product focus, as well as how those products work together. So when we are talking to customers, they might only want to buy one product but they can see the vision of how these products work together. Continuous delivery, for example. You can buy just one product in continuous delivery but if you think about how you are going to evolve your digital footprint over time and build net new innovations and get up to market quickly, you can see as you are own internal processes improve, how CA products that work together with little to no integration cost, will streamline your ability to turn yourself into a software company. So we kind of call this whole package together. The software factory and as we start putting these elements together, I think what's happening is customers are starting to envision their business in the context of being a software company and we kind of fit the mould really well there. So it's not any one thing. It's great sales execution supported by great product with a marketing team that’s really helping tell, a much broader, more sophisticated story. And Kieran, maybe you can answer the backlog question. Kieran McGrath Yes. So we are to report the acquisitions in total, as we always do. You will be give a clear view of what the acquisitive versus organic contribution is on both the new sales and a revenue perspective. Right now, we are giving guidance for three to four points for the year. We think the acquisitions are going to be roughly worth about 4 points. The reason I am hedging a little bit is I only closed Veracode on the 31 st . We have to do the valuation work and the whole of new impairment. While that work has to be done as we go through time, but we clearly call out the acquisitive nature in aggregate for both of those. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. Abhey Lamba Good execution there. So, Mike, when we are looking at your organic revenue growth this year, how sustainable is it in fiscal '18? I understand you made comments that we should see new sales growth better than your renewal, but your renewals are going to be declining in the high teens, the portfolio is going to be declining in the high teens. So are we modeling the new sales to grow on an organic basis in fiscal '18? Michael Gregoire Yes. I think when we take a look at new sales, we have more wind in our sales then we had in the past, especially on the organic piece. A lot of our new sales are land and expand and coming out of Q3 and Q4 with a lot of land deals, that gives us an opportunity to expand and that will all show up as organic. And with a lot of a new product introductions that we have coupled with this notion of getting these products to work together, we become much more competitive against single product companies, as we are starting to tell our story because at the end of the day, most of these companies are not thinking about just one product or solve one problem, they are trying to orchestrate a digital re-mastering of their business. And in order to do that, you are going to need multiple products, very few companies have multiple products that can work together as well as having those products in their portfolio. So we feel somewhat bullish that we are going to be able to get the organic growth engine moving and have that growing consistently. Kieran, maybe you would like to add to that based on some of the numbers you have been monitoring. Kieran McGrath So I guess, first of all, as you are probably aware, we don’t normally usually guide on new sales as we go forward. However, as Mike has been describing, we think about organic performance, ES revenue actually grew organically in fiscal '17 by two points. The mainframe was down a point. So overall our product revenue was actually flat in '17 with mainframe down a point, and ES up two points. So we look forward to time here. Obviously, we expect the mainframe market is declining in the low single digits to continue our planning at that level of planning, but we would expect to move to a time here that ES will continue to exhibit organic growth. Abhey Lamba Got it. Thanks, Kieran. Absolutely, that's very helpful. Thanks for the additional color. Kieran, you talked about the impact of ASU 2016-09 adoption. Can you quantify the impact on your cash flows in your guidance? Thanks. Kieran McGrath No. Because we are going to actually doing it retrospectively, there will be no changes in the year to year. It's a relatively small amount to begin with but we are going to restate '17 and '18, so there won't be any impact on year to year. Abhey Lamba So what will your fiscal '17 cash flow be in that accounting method? Kieran McGrath Honestly, I don’t have it in front of me here right now. It's about $30 million. Yes. So my guys are telling me here, it's about $30 million. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard So I guess two questions. One similar to what Michael asked you on the revenue backlog. I think the billings backlog may have benefitted as well from the acquisition. Could you quantify what the impact was there from, I guess, Veracode and Automic. Kieran McGrath Right. So from an organic perspective, on the constant currency perspective in total, we are up 9%. The acquisitions contributed about two points to that 9%. Walter Pritchard And what about on the short-term? Kieran McGrath I am sorry, that was the short term number I was saying. The current is growing nine points, two points of that is related to the acquisitions. Walter Pritchard Okay. Great. And then just on, it looks like execution pretty much across the board was pretty good. The one area that I saw in the script, you said that Europe was up, I guess new business was up but you have the benefit I think of Automic, which is probably more biased to Europe. Was there execution issue or anything going on in Europe or was this just kind of normal quarter to quarter volatility in terms of your performance over there. Michael Gregoire Normal, mid-single digit Q4 sales growth in Europe. Automic was a large driver of the new sales growth but I think we haven't seen anything that was other than ordinary. I think we really like the southern region, both France and some of the south did better than what we expected. Walter Pritchard Okay. Got it. And then Kieran, are you going to disclose, I guess for Q4, what the non-recurring and to the extent it happens in Q1, what's the non-recurring related expenses were from the two acquisitions? I think those are in your OpEx. Kieran McGrath So I won't be disclosing specifics. I guess what I would say is that we did have some onetime deal related costs that took place in Q4. As we move into fiscal '18, what we will really be seeing is the impact of both the deferred revenue impairment, the acquisition integration cost, and quite frankly, the Veracode business that we purchased is a business that’s losing money at this point in time. So for the year, we think it's going to be impactful to us. But most of that impact, quite frankly, in the first half of the year and more specifically in the first quarter, but I would say the one time transaction related deal costs are behind us and large and what we are really dealing with now are integration costs, deferred revenue impairment and just the normal business run. Operator Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Mike Gregoire, Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks. Michael Gregoire Great. Well, thanks again for joining us this evening. I would like to leave you with a few partying comments. We definitely had a great Q4. We are really pleased with our execution and we are entering fiscal 2018 with solid momentum. That said, please keep in mind that the large system integrator renewal we signed in Q1 last year creates a very difficult compare in Q1 fiscal 2018. And that our recent acquisitions will be most impactful to our operating margins in the first half of fiscal; 2018, particularly in Q1, just as Kieran said. We have made some excellent progress over the last several years building a solid foundation from which we can grow. I am optimistic and I look forward to fiscal 2018 and beyond. Thank you, very much. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open. Raimo Lenschow Two if I may. First of all, Mike, can you talk a little bit about when you see a new sales perform better than renewals. That’s my first and I have one quick follow up then. Michael Gregoire Sure. Well, thank you, Raimo. Actually for FY '17, if you exclude the mainframe capacity, new sales growth exceeded the growth in the renewal portfolio. And given our improved product portfolio, we believe new sales should be significantly better than the renewal portfolio this year in FY '18. I think that statement should be true on an organic basis as well. Raimo Lenschow Okay. Perfect. Really that sounds like you have turned a corner. And can I talk about the -- you mentioned the changes in the sales organization. I mean it's like enterprise commercial kind of seems to make a lot of sense. How much disruption should we get? Should we kind of expect from that or is it kind of all done and can you talk through that a little bit? Michael Gregoire Yes. I expect no disruption in it. The people who are covering accounts are covering the same accounts. We have moved some of the smaller accounts what we call commercial. And this has been something we have been working at for a couple of years as we have tried to improve the commercial segment. We finally felt coming out of Q3, Q4 performance that they were mature enough, had enough process and experience where they could service those customers. That coupled with the portfolio, as you know we have been rapidly moving towards more SaaS solution. Try and buy, lend and extend. Those solutions lend themselves well in those sales. And then strategically, as we know that our enterprise portfolio will relatively midterm, exceed the mainframe portfolio, we have to take into consideration our cost structure on sales and try to use a very expense sales force at a segment of the market that could easily be served by a broader sales force, is in the best interest for CA, both tactically and strategically. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Matt Hedberg Automic did a lot better than I think you guys had thought. I am curious, Mike, what drove that outperformance. Was it conservative assumptions or was it just a lot of broad net new sales that you saw in the quarter. Michael Gregoire Yes. I think it's a couple of things. First, a lot of net new [raw] [ph] sales couple with the fact it was their year-end, so their sales professionals have been working on deals and that all came together at the end of their quarter. And the secondly, customers that were evaluating multiple providers, the strength of the CA brand and ability to service customers on a global basis as well as the ability to link other products into their portfolio, gave then a strategic view into what the future could look like as they try to automate their whole infrastructure. So I think it was a combination of those three things that gave a little bit of up performance but I definitely want to hand off a lot of congratulations to the Automic team. They really went after the quarter with a lot of gusto. Matt Hedberg That’s helpful. Thank you. And then Kieran, I am curious on 606. It sounds like we will see more tomorrow. I am curious though, can you provide a little bit more color on potentially the impact to reported revenue. I guess the license component. Anything you can kind of help us out with a little bit more color on that. Kieran McGrath I think, Matt, it's a little premature on that for me to start giving specifics on it. But as you can well expect, we are a business that has been very primarily ratable, very small amount of upfront revenue, you can see that within the SFO accounts that we have. So converting the license content which is obviously quite material in both the ES and mainframe business. We will add volatility in any one given quarter. We think it's more than [indiscernible] over time. The length of time, maybe somewhat debatable but I think that’s what we are in the process of really sizing here. And what we are looking at -- are really looking for metrics that we will be able to add to the top line reported numbers to try and give a sense of the continuity in the business as we move through time. That said, when we pull back and we take a look at our ability to bill our customers and collect the cash markup from this, we don’t see anything there. And quite frankly, we are not making changes to or contractual relationships to our customer. The customer is at the center of our business and we don’t think it's right to go and impact the customers with changes that are being driven by accounting. And from what we can see right now, we don’t think that true, fundamental economics are going to change although license in any given period will be more volatile. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is now open. John DiFucci So guys, bookings were very strong. Even if you normalize for duration, I think bookings were up something in the double digits. Mike, you mentioned the strong renewals and strong lease sales and you also doubled the number of large deals. So I guess I have two questions. One, and I know your deals, like we try to model when they are supposed to renew. And I know that gets missed around a lot. So I am just curious, were there more deals that were signed early, more than normal. I know that happens every quarter. Did that happen this quarter? And then secondly, it sounds like your catching of new business to renewals is working really well and that’s great. So how is progress in signing new deals outside of a renewal cycle, whether it's with existing customers or new customers? Michael Gregoire Sure. Well, first, we didn’t naturally pull any deals forward in Q4, so that was pretty much standard practice, nothing outstanding or nothing special there. The new business inside the renewal, it's just a function of the quality of the products. I think we have almost everyone of our products either up in the Magic Quadrant or in the highest ranking of our top eight new focus products. So those products are very attractive to our customer and we have a sales team that intimately understands these customers, especially the large ones, John, as you all know, and having great products being sold in to, with those renewals. It was bigger than we probably anticipated but I would credit that with the quality of the products and the interesting nature of the solution that how the solutions work together. We also had uptick in volume in sales outside of the renewal portfolio. So more deals. But if you think about how the market is buying, it is try and buy, it is lend and expand. So you are going to see more transaction volume. I think it was the biggest transaction volume we have ever had for net new clients. The size of the transactions are relatively small compared to what we would sell into the renewal base. And I think over time, the lend and expand, those now are footprints for expand. Kieran, maybe you have a thought on that as well? Kieran McGrath Just one other point. So, John, if you recall, in prior quarters we had advised that we thought the renewal portfolio for this year was going to be up in the high teens. In fact, we kind of [indiscernible] rounding, we actually ended up in the mid-teens. So I think that’s pretty clear evidence that we really didn’t see any unnatural pull forward of any significant amount of deals that we hadn't been forecasting. So that’s clear. I think, Mike, you hit it right on the head, we are starting to see, especially with a lot of our SaaS businesses, we are seeing something like Blazemeter here, which is all done to digital sales. Just the volume is really exploding from that side of the business at once again is a very, relatively smaller price point. Michael Gregoire Is that helpful, John? John DiFucci Yes. That’s really helpful, guys. And just one, I guess follow up, Mike. So is that part of what's giving you the confidence, from the first question, from Raimo's question about the new sales this year is just volume of some of the try to buy, try before you buy or lend and expand type strategy. Michael Gregoire Yes. Of that end, we have put four products, net new organic products in the market that generated over $50 million in sales in relatively short period of time. I have four new SaaS products that come out in the next, that are all organically built. That is right in the confines of our strategy, making our portfolio work a little bit closer together. So it's a combination of good sales execution and really strong products that seems to be coming together for us. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Due to no response we will go to the next question. And our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Philip Winslow Obviously, you got a stronger quarter about new sales and renewals and I appreciate the commentary that you guys gave on the renewal portfolio. Just wanted to dig into those. First, Mike, just in terms of the renewal rates that’s you are seeing from a dollar perspective on the renewal side. Any sort of change, up or down, that you note there? And then also you mentioned that the renewals portfolio will be down this coming year and more backend loaded. I wonder if you can give us some more color in terms of just the waiting there for first half, second half. Michael Gregoire Sure. The renewal rate was pretty much the same that we have seen quarter-over-quarter. So no new changes there. Kieran has got his finger tightly on the pulse of the backlog and how the renewals are working, so I will let him answer that question. Kieran McGrath Sure. So as we think about, obviously we have our -- in the first quarter of this year, we have a pretty big difficult compare against a deal we had with an outsourcer in the first quarter of last year. So that’s going to really make the renewals on the new sales a very difficult compare in Q1. As we go through the rest of the year, I mean that starts to flatten out and even be up a little bit in the last part of the year. So for the whole of the year, as I said in my script, we are going to be down on a year-over-year basis in the high teens. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits Two questions regarding acquisition. One, Mike, obviously this has been a very aggressive couple of years in terms of the dollar amount and [indiscernible]. 12 of the 300 million to 500 million bogie. So maybe if you could tell me how you are feeling at this point in terms of the -- next couple of years. Michael Gregoire Sure. Michael, you are breaking up a little bit. I think you are just saying how are we feeling now? Kieran McGrath I think you were asking about acquisitions, Michael. Michael Turits Yes. Sorry, headset malfunction there. Yes, acquisition were above, obviously $1.5 billion to $2 billion in last couple of years, above the $300 million to $500 million bogie, thoughts on the pace going forward? Michael Gregoire Sure. If I had my way in the world, what I would love to do is digest these acquisitions that we made. We are very excited about them. But as you know, acquisitions take work and I have always preferred, given my choice to do smaller acquisitions, in the $50 million to $80 million range, that have good base technology that needs organic engineering from us to get those products the scale and then put it through our marketing and distribution engines. Unfortunately, we don’t get to chose how these things work. If you take a look at Automic, for example. That was a two year quoting period and it finally came to conclusion. It just so happened that Veracode which we have been looking at for a long period of time, that happened in a relatively near time frame to Automic. Given my choice, I would have rather spread those out over time. But when you have an opportunity at properties like that, it's a price that we feel is right for value, you want to be able to execute. Now having said that, I think that our view on value is probably going to get a little tougher because we don’t feel we need to be out in the market. Now if something that was extraordinary was to come along, we would like the flexibility to go ahead and do that. But right now, I would like to digest what we have and just keep our eyes wide open for small tuck-ins that fit our strategy and hope that nothing material hits the market that we are really interested in. Michael Turits Okay. And then you guys gave lots of help to us in terms of doing organic calculations. So really appreciate that. Just one, I don’t think you necessarily gave on the current revenue backlog which I believe is up 6% constant currency. Was that roughly five points from acquisition, because obviously that’s being going positive, something we are trying to closely monitor? Michael Gregoire Yes. So of the six points of constant currency, about half of it, three points was related to Veracode which as you know we closed on the absolute last day of the quarter and then Automic. And then the other portion, the other half was related to just the timing of the renewal portfolio that comes due here in fiscal '18, as well as the Q4 new sales. Michael Turits So you are saying it's three points only from acquisitions that’s inorganic in that’s six points. Michael Gregoire That’s correct. Michael Turits Okay. Thanks. I guess, if I squeeze one in. So does that feel though, I mean you said there is some timing. I mean this has been a big deal to talk about, one you felt like that was turning up in a sustainable way. So are those timing issues suggesting that that is not the turn or you think it might be? Michael Gregoire You know I like to hit it straight down the middle with you guys.

And then Kieran, can you just remind us of the assumed impact from Automic and Veracode on revenue guidance for FY '18?

So, Mike, when we are looking at your organic revenue growth this year, how sustainable is it in fiscal '18? I understand you made comments that we should see new sales growth better than your renewal, but your renewals are going to be declining in the high teens, the portfolio is going to be declining in the high teens.

The current is growing nine points, two points of that is related to the acquisitions. Walter Pritchard Okay. Great. And then just on, it looks like execution pretty much across the board was pretty good. The one area that I saw in the script, you said that Europe was up, I guess new business was up but you have the benefit I think of Automic, which is probably more biased to Europe. Was there execution issue or anything going on in Europe or was this just kind of normal quarter to quarter volatility in terms of your performance over there. Michael Gregoire Normal, mid-single digit Q4 sales growth in Europe. Automic was a large driver of the new sales growth but I think we haven't seen anything that was other than ordinary. I think we really like the southern region, both France and some of the south did better than what we expected. Walter Pritchard Okay. Got it. And then Kieran, are you going to disclose, I guess for Q4, what the non-recurring and to the extent it happens in Q1, what's the non-recurring related expenses were from the two acquisitions? I think those are in your OpEx. Kieran McGrath So I won't be disclosing specifics. I guess what I would say is that we did have some onetime deal related costs that took place in Q4. As we move into fiscal '18, what we will really be seeing is the impact of both the deferred revenue impairment, the acquisition integration cost, and quite frankly, the Veracode business that we purchased is a business that’s losing money at this point in time. So for the year, we think it's going to be impactful to us. But most of that impact, quite frankly, in the first half of the year and more specifically in the first quarter, but I would say the one time transaction related deal costs are behind us and large and what we are really dealing with now are integration costs, deferred revenue impairment and just the normal business run. Operator Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Mike Gregoire, Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks. Michael Gregoire Great. Well, thanks again for joining us this evening. I would like to leave you with a few partying comments. We definitely had a great Q4. We are really pleased with our execution and we are entering fiscal 2018 with solid momentum. That said, please keep in mind that the large system integrator renewal we signed in Q1 last year creates a very difficult compare in Q1 fiscal 2018. And that our recent acquisitions will be most impactful to our operating margins in the first half of fiscal; 2018, particularly in Q1, just as Kieran said. We have made some excellent progress over the last several years building a solid foundation from which we can grow. I am optimistic and I look forward to fiscal 2018 and beyond. Thank you, very much. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

And now I'll turn the call over to Lip-Bu. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with our first quarter results. Consistent execution drove solid operating results, and it was a great quarter for innovation with several new product introductions. I will address the environment and strategy before turning to the first quarter customer and product highlights. Starting with the environment, semiconductor business conditions appear to have stabilized with expectations of low-single-digit growth for 2017. However, expected improvements are sector-specific, and macro uncertainty remains. We have successfully managed through some customer consolidation and expect just a minimum impact on revenue in 2017. Turning next to strategy, we are steadily executing our System Design Enablement or SDE strategy. SDE offers additional growth opportunities as we expand beyond semiconductors and tap into a significantly larger market with system companies and new vertical market segments. Cadence is pursuing opportunities in higher growth area, including automotive, cloud infrastructure, machine learning, and aerospace and defense. In Q1, we expanded our engagement with Renesas for the design of their industry-leading ADAS, autonomous driving and IoT semiconductor solutions using Innovus, Virtuoso Advanced-Node and the Cadence verification suite. Let me now turn to some of our product highlights and customer successes for the first quarter. Innovation is the engine of our success, and we have introduced more than 20 significant internally-developed products in the last three years. In Q1, we launched Xcelium, the industry's first parallel simulator for production use, and the Protium S1 FPGA-Based Prototyping Platform for early software development. Xcelium and Protium S1 joined JasperGold for formal verification and Palladium Z1 for emulation as the four core connected engines of our verification suite. Xcelium incorporates innovative multi-core parallel computing technology from last year's acquisition of Rocketick, and it has been deployed at several customers across multiple domains, including ARM and STMicroelectronics. Protium S1, new architecture increase scalability and speed, and reduce design bring-up time due to common compiler with the Palladium Z1. A number of new customers have purchased the Protium S1 including Xilinx and Mellanox Technologies. After a successful 2016, the Palladium Z1 continue to do well with seven new customers, six of them being system companies and additional seven customer make repeat orders. We also introduced a new product within digital and signoff in earlier April called Pegasus. The Pegasus Verification System is massively parallel, cloud-ready, physical verification signoff solution that can deliver up to 10x improved performance across hundreds of CPUs. Early adopters includes Texas Instruments and Microsemi. Our focus on innovation and market-shaping customers is paying off as place and route revenue was up over 20% with the top 20 semiconductor companies year-over-year. Also, our integration of our leading custom-analog and new digital products provides customers with the best solution for their mixed-signal designs. Several top-tier customers are now using full Cadence mixed-signal flow from IP block characterizations through implementation to full chip verification. Next, I would like to talk about our IP business, which is a key component of our SDE strategy. IP market opportunity is strong as outsourcing trend keeps growing. We see the result of our strategic refinement of our IP business with strong year-over-year revenue growth. We booked our largest design IP contract ever with a major customer in the automotive semiconductor sector. Also, a major Asian semiconductor company is using Tensilica Vision P5 processor to improve image quality in its mobile products. Looking to the future, I am most excited about the opportunity for our Tensilica processors in artificial intelligence, automotive and vision applications. Before turning it over to Geoff, let me quickly summarize my comments. Consistent execution drove solid financial results for Q1. System Design Enablement is expanding our opportunity beyond EDA and extending our customer reach. Innovation is the engine of our success. And so far this year we have introduced three significant new products. Our digital and signoff tools are proliferating for advanced-node design with market-shaping customers. Our refined IP strategy set us up to drive scalable, profitable growth as evidenced by Q1 results. Now I will turn the call over to Geoff to review financial results and provide our outlook. Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Thanks, Lip-Bu, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent execution led to strong operating results for Q1. Key results for the quarter were total revenue was $477 million; non-GAAP operating margin was 26%; GAAP net income per share was $0.25; non-GAAP net income per share was $0.32; and operating cash flow was $92 million. Also note that the recurring revenue mix was approximately 90%, but Cadence did not repurchase any stock in the first quarter. DSOs were 37 days, up 4 days from Q4 due to the delays in collecting several large payments. Most of these payments have already been collected in Q2. We now expect DSO to be approximately 35 days for 2017. Service revenue was down $11 million year-over-year. Service revenue that is recognized on a completed contract basis can lead to variability from quarter to quarter. Service revenue was down year-over-year, primarily because in Q1 of 2016 we recognized a large amount on a completed contract. Tensilica had a strong revenue quarter and a onetime benefit to royalties. The onetime benefit was a result of beginning to recognize royalties on a current-quarter basis. Excluding this onetime benefit, our IP business still had strong growth. Now let's turn to outlook. There is no change in our outlook for the year for revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS and operating cash flow. For fiscal 2017, we expect revenue in the range of $1.9 billion to $1.95 billion, which would be a 6% growth at the midpoint; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 27%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.93 to $1.03; non-GAAP EPS of $1.32 to $1.42; and operating cash flow in the range of $430 million to $470 million. And for Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $470 million to $480 million; non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 26%; GAAP EPS in the range of $0.20 to $0.22; and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.31 to $0.33. Approximately 90% of revenue is expected to come from beginning backlog. You will find guidance for additional items in the CFO Commentary. I also want to provide a few additional comments before we take questions. As a reminder, hardware and IP have become a larger portion of our business, which may lead to more variability in results from quarter to quarter. Only about 5% of our revenue is in currencies other than U.S. dollar, primarily the Japanese yen, but about 30% of our costs are in currencies other than in dollar. So a weakening dollar would generally be a headwind to operating profits, and conversely, a strengthening dollar would be a tailwind. The dollar has weakened since the beginning of the year, and we are taking steps to manage our costs accordingly. As you know, we've been reviewing the new revenue accounting standard that we will implement for 2018, and we are confident that we will substantially maintain recurring revenue treatment. Now in closing, we had a strong first quarter, delivering both financial results that met or exceeded our expectations and introducing new innovative products. Looking to the future, I like the opportunities created by our SDE strategy, innovative new products and trends such as autonomous driving, cloud infrastructure, industrial IoT and machine learning, just to name a few. So with that, operator, we'll now take questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Your first question comes from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Overall a good quarter. I just had one question starting on kind of the digital side. It looks like that's seeing some lumpiness. It's up double digits last quarter and now it's kind of up singles. And on conversely as well, the IP business, it looks like it's now growing at double digits again. So could you maybe walk me through how we should expect that to shape out for the rest of the year in both of these segments? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yes. So on the digital side, Mitch, the actual revenue growth was close to 6% compared to Q1 of 2016. You're right, the apparent growth was lower than recent results. This was because in Q1 of 2016, included a large completed service contract, which was included in our digital and signoff product line. But we're seeing a lot of success in our digital and signoff products proliferating with market-shaping customers, and new customers are adopting these products. We expect good growth for 2017. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC Got it. Yeah. And then secondly on the IP side, seeing that growing at double-digits apparently, do you expect that to continue in 2017? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yes. We did have a onetime benefit from our IP business as we started recognizing royalties on a current quarter basis. But excluding that onetime benefit, our IP business still had strong growth in the mid-teens in Q1 over Q1. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Got it. Thank you very much. Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Great. Operator Your next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc. Thank you. Good evening. Lip-Bu, let me start with you and ask about opportunities you may have for incremental revenue and share in a number of respects. First of all, let's ask about geography. When we look at 2016 EDA industry results, there was a very substantial increase in China. We know how much of that was due to Mentor from the numbers in their 10-K, but that still left well over $200 million in revenues from China for everybody else. So perhaps you could talk about how you're doing there and what share progress you're making in China. Secondly, you highlighted a number of new products including Pegasus and Protium. Could you talk about how you think about the share opportunity with Pegasus? It's an enormous category that you're addressing, but by the same token it's historically proven to be very, very sticky for incumbent products. And then lastly on new products line, with respect to Protium, your revenues in FPGA prototyping to-date have been immaterial relative to what Synopsys is doing there, for example, with their HAPS products. So, again, similarly maybe you could talk about how you're thinking about the revenue or the share opportunity in that hardware category, then a couple for Geoff. Thanks. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah, Chris (17:45), thank you so much for the question. So a couple of things. One, I think you mentioned about the geographical. Clearly, the China is a great opportunity. We are well-positioned in China and we are very confident to continue to drive success and growth not only on the tool side and also the IP side. And China, as you know, the government is very committed to build up their domestic semiconductor industry with heavy investment. And we've done well in China. So we're going to continue. It's going to be a growth opportunity for us in China. And then regarding the new products, so couple of things that you highlight. Thank you for bringing it up. Pegasus, and this is very important for us to complete our digital and signoff flow. And as you – in the recall, we are building up quite a lot of the digital success with Innovus. I mentioned about 20% growth with a top 20 customer. And then we have Genus on the Synthesis side, and we have Signoff on Tempus and Voltus on Power. And then now, this physical verification become the missing piece, we are delighted to completely from ground up building up this product, massively parallel and cloud-ready and can scale up to 1,000 CPUs, and then drive 10x in terms of turnaround time. This is very, very significant. And we are delighted a couple of customer already support us, and we mentioned that in our script. And so this should be as exciting so that we have complete full flow opportunity for our customer to drive from – the Innovus and the place and route, all the way to physical verification. And, of course, working closely with our foundry partners are critical for the success. And then the other two new product we also have a successful launch, and that is on the verification part of our business. And then clearly, it's very exciting for us to complete our whole verification suite. As you'll recall, we have the JasperGold. That is very strong position in the formal verification. We have hardware, Z1 have been very strong for emulation. And what we like to do is basically to really complete that with the FPGA prototyping. And this is something that can scale up to 600 million gates. And then using the same compiler as the Z1 hardware emulation, so the customer can really go from prototyping all the way to massive scaling in term of emulation. And then the other part is in our simulation tool to – with the acquisition of Rocketick. They provide very, very strong parallel simulator, and that engine can be very – we fully integrate it with (20:50) called Xcelium. This is a first production-ready parallel simulator, very well-received with the customer. And we're delighted so that we can complete the whole verification suite to provide to our customer. On the Protium FPGA side, we have Xylene and Mellanox with us and plus a few others. And then – so it's a very early state, but people are really excited about it. We are very positive about that. Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc. You highlighted a number of end markets that you're focusing on like auto, aero and defense and so forth. Could you again remind us how you're organizing yourselves to address those markets in terms of teams or sales or anything out that kind? And then one of the persistent issues for you and for EDA historically has always been, particularly when you've had active new product periods, is having sufficient AE capacity. And maybe you could address that issue, how you're doing there, and having the requisite support in AEs and so forth that you think you're going to need, given the multiple new product ramps that you now have to manage? Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. Thank you so much for the question. This is very much related to our strategy of System Design Enablement. And this is really providing not just the core EDA strength of our increased adoption and not only the IP strategy for the scalable growth, but more important right now, we are moving into some of the emerging new growth area. We've highlight a couple of them. This is automotive, the massive data center, and then the machine learning-related and then apply into some of this vertical market that we are going after. Thank you for bringing it up. We have very, very focused on the aerospace and defense. Over the last few quarters, we highlight Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems and also GE Aviation that we are very deeply engaged with them. And then same thing with automotive, and we've mentioned up (23:03) Mobileye using our Palladium Z1 for automotive vision and also Infineon for the automotive function safety. And stay tuned, we do right now (23:16) have a dedicated team to focus on the automotive and a dedicated team to focus for aviation and defense. And so some of this vertical beside providing the tool, the IP, the emulation, but more important, we're going to learn what their new requirements are, and then we're going to be starting to pick up the area that we need to either organically growing or through acquisition to provide the total solution to our customer in the system and then somewhat the vertical market that we are pursuing. Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc. All right. But again, just to pick on this point. You're saying in effect that field support, AEs, all that sort of thing that historically has been a constraint for EDA when ramping new products is not an issue for you right now or a manageable one? Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. So what we did is basically continue the AE support. It's very important for someone's (24:16) success. But we relocate and then we rearrange and then recruit somewhat the talent on the AE side for some of defense, aerospace and automotive, and then continue to drive efficiency. So in some way we are driving the efficiency of the AE support to our current customer and put more resources in some of this vertical market and to support their success. Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc. Thank you, Lip-Bu. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a few of them. First one, Geoff, just wanted to find out why no buybacks this quarter? Like you guys have been doing it at a very consistent pace for the last three years. So I'm kind of surprised why there was no buyback. And is there any reasoning behind it? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. So when we announced the program in the Q1 or the Q4 earnings call in February timeframe, we said we're going to be more flexible with this most recent authorization. We're sticking to that. Don't take any other messages besides we're being more flexible. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got you. So it's not like you are constrained by certain, like, events or something. It's just more your own choice? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. We're just going to be more flexible moving forward. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got you. All right. And then a follow-up on the ASC 606 rev rec, so you guys are still confident that you can maintain the 90% ratable revenue that you have. I'm kind of curious, A, is that still the case? And if there is a risk of that ratable revenue going away, how much of the 90% do you think would be at risk? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yes. So we are going to implement a new standard, as you know, ASC 606 in 2018. We are confident that we will substantially maintain recurring revenue treatment for the language or in a language of the new standard revenue over time treatment. We're not committing to a particular percentage right now. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got you. But a significant portion of the 90% can be... Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Or substantially maintain, I think, is the keyword, substantially maintain. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got you. All right. And then on the IP revenue side, I had a two-part question. One is, what do you think the IP revenue or the IP business for the overall industry growth this year, is it still a 15% to 20% growth business? And for you specifically, of your IP revenues, how much is upfront versus ratable? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. So, upfront versus ratable, a lot of them we issue a license, and we would recognize the revenue when we deliver the license. Sometimes we do longer-term deals and those too can be recognized over time, essentially when we take over, for example, somebody's roadmap for a particular type of IP. And then royalties are booked now when our customers ship the product and we recognize royalties over that. And we've never really communicated the percentage of IPs that's recurring or not. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got you. All right. Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. And we anticipate we're going to have double-digit growth for this year overall on the IP business, low double digits. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Just to add on to what Geoff is talking about, clearly we have this refinement of the IP business to drive profitability and scalability. And we are very much on track of that, and then so double-digit growth. And then the outsourcing trend is continue. And that create opportunity for us. And then clearly we are focused on standardized, off-the-shelf IP, strategic vertical market and most advanced process node and top customer. So we really drive quality revenue with the top customer. That is our focus. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got you. That's very helpful. And then two last quick questions. One is, what is the weighted average contract life in the quarter? And did you guys have any revenues from FPGA prototyping? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. So yes, we had revenue from FPGA prototyping and Protium S1. It was our first quarter of release to market, so we're excited about the revenue. And Lip-Bu mentioned a couple of the customers that we've already recognized business with. The weighted average contract life, since we stopped on our Q1 earnings call giving bookings guidance, we're also not giving the weighted average contract life anymore. We don't think it's really relevant, and we're concentrated on deal quality, not on those two metrics. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch All right. Thank you. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Thank you. Operator And the next question is from Rich Valera from Needham & Company. Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC Thank you. Question on the emulation market. Historically, new emulation products releases by yourself and Mentor have had pretty meaningful impacts on the growth rate of your respective emulation businesses. It looks like Mentor just released their new Strato platform this quarter. So still very early there. But, one, could you say, have you seen it in the market? Do you have any sense of how that backs up competitively if it changes the competitive dynamics? And do you think it has any impact on the market or do you think maybe the market's matured enough and is big enough now that it doesn't necessarily have the same impact as it might have in the past? Thank you. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. Richard, this is Lip-Bu. Let me start first. Clearly, this emulation business continue to be good. Last year, we announced Z1. We have a phenomenal first full year, and then with 29 new Palladium logos. And first quarter, we continue to sell well. We have seven new customer, I mentioned, and then also seven make repeat orders, so very strong Q1. So we expect to be a strong year for 2017. Regarding the Mentor announcing their new product, we haven't seen them in the marketplace or customer. And we stay tuned and we keep a close eye on it. And so clearly the emulation business for the most advanced node and complex design is a must-have in term of time to market to verification. We continue to see strong customer interest in our Z1. And then many customers doubled, tripled down the capacity scale, and it's phenomenal. So we are excited about it. Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. And as far as Q1 was concerned, it was roughly flat to Q4. And as we said last time, we still expect a strong year for hardware. But, of course, you realize you were coming off of a record year, will make the year-over-year comps difficult, but we still expect a very strong year in hardware. Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC That's helpful. Thank you. And then you've mentioned a couple of markets, particularly auto – I guess a combination of auto or more specifically ADAS, and then IoT, and I think AI as well. I'm just wondering, aside from IP, where I'm assuming you probably have some, call it, vertically-focused IP from maybe some of these markets, can you talk about your other efforts at putting together sort of vertically focused solutions and what that's comprised of, and what kind of success you've had at sort of vertically targeting these certain markets? Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. So let me try to address that. Clearly, automotive is a faster growing area for us. We are excited about it. And so we mentioned in our earnings script, we are delighted on the Renesas expanded engagement. And a lot with the tools and Innovus and the custom, the advanced-node and also the verification suite. We also mentioned quite a bit on the design IP front. We have a very big contract and with a very big automotive component company. And we are excited about it, and this is on the IP front, on the design IP. And then clearly, we continue to focus on the function safety that we mentioned about Infineon. We're focused on the reliability and simulation side, and also on the emulation side with the Mobileye. And so this a major focus. We have a dedicated team to drive the success. And we can learn a lot in the automotive space working with the Tier 1, the automotive manufacturers directly, and so they're understanding their requirement so that we can provide them a total solution, not just a tool, not just a IP, and also provide them what they need in term of Tensilica, the Vision and ADAS requirement, and then working with the sensor companies. And either its LADAR or LIDAR or even some of the laser approach and to drive the level 4, level 5 autonomous driving. And we're heavily engaging with all the above. Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC Got it. Thank you, Lip-Bu. Just one more for Geoff, if I could. Geoff, can you give us a sense of what your cash tax rate is right now and how you think that could be impacted? I mean, if you just pick a theoretical, whether it's 15% or 25% rate, if the federal rate was changed, how that would or wouldn't affect the cash taxes you might pay? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. We obviously haven't released our Q for Q1, but for last year, our cash tax rate was between 10% and 15%, varied a little bit from quarter to quarter. And how it's going to go in the future is your guess is as good as ours. Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC Got it. Okay. Thanks very much gentlemen. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Thank you. Operator The next question is from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I wanted to follow on the emulation question. You mentioned that it's still selling strongly. But given the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Just wondering, is that just seasonality or is there any lead time issues, or have we actually seen the peak in this cycle and we're starting to enter the tail? Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. So I think, Sterling, let me start first. So far, we don't see the peak clearly from our customer. We are heavily engaged with the customer. They want to have more. Actually the scalability is critical. We are excited working with the top-tier customer and meet their requirement. And this is something that's very important to them in term of their design – complex design to verify and that they really like it. And so far, we continue to see strong demand from our customer. And then meanwhile right now, we also have the FPGA version. This is a Protium using the same compiler, and then can scale up to 600 million gates, and that can effectively compete with the other competitors. And so we have a two-pronged approach. And then using same compiler, the customer can stay with us on both front on the emulation and FPGA front. Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. And again, I think we continue to see emulation being a secular trend, right, that would benefit clearly us, but perhaps our competitors – certainly our competitors also, but it's a secular trend. It will be lumpy though. It will go up and down for a period of time, but secular trend still continues, Sterling. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC That's fair. And, Geoff, you touched upon the variability given the IP in the hardware. Just trying to put the model together and get it to triangulate, is it fair to say that in the quarter that the time-based license or time-based ratable revenue was actually less than 90% in the quarter? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. It was approximately 90%. It's been consistently for a very long time for us. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then last question, I wasn't clear, you may have mentioned, Geoff, early on in terms of the IP business that unless I misheard it that there were some onetime items. I'm just – if you can give us some more color on that front in particular. And then you talked about the strength in automotive around IP. Is that something you could turn around and see the same customers come back for additional IP rights on top of it? Or how should we think about the timing of repeat purchases from customers in that space? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. So we did have a onetime benefit, one onetime benefit related to recognizing royalties, Tensilica royalties on a current quarter basis. Even excluding that, our IP business grew mid-teens year-over-year. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. And we mentioned about two big opportunity for us. One is we just signed and booked the largest design IP contract with the automotive semiconductor sector, and then also a major Asian semiconductor adopting the Tensilica for the mobile products. So overall we are excited about IP, and our refined strategy is working. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. Thank you, guys. Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Thank you. Operator The next question is from Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thanks for taking my question. My first question, Lip-Bu, is like if I look at your growth and your year-over-year growth the last few years, every year it has been decelerating. And it's now at about 6% this year. I just wanted to understand like how do you think about the long-term growth of the business? Is it more like a 5% growth business over next few years? And what is really needed to make it more like a 10% growth? Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Okay. Good question, Farhan. Couple of points. First of all, we are confident with our strategy and direction of the business and the future opportunity. We are pleased with the revenue growth for this year, 6%, with the order mix environment that we are operating in. And I think a couple of things that are good driver for us. Our core EDA software is doing well, growing with all the new product we came out. And then the IPs rebound to 10% growth rate. And then the hardware continue to be a good year this year for us. So I think overall I think we are pleased with what we see in the marketplace, and that's why we guided 6%. And in terms of the trend are going down, clearly, we are mission-critical solution to our customer. And I think we continue to drive value and very disciplined in what we provide to our customer. I strongly believe collaborating deeply with the customer, deliver innovative product to meet their challenger's design. And then the other part and I think they are going to help us to grow the business in terms of revenue growth will be the system design enablement. And that's where we are moving into some of the vertical area and then the vertical market. And then addressing some of the higher growth opportunity in automotive, data center and then the aerospace and defense-related area. And again, the chip design is getting more and more complex. We are very mission-critical, and the design and verification is getting a lot more complex. And we can drive a lot more value. And that's why we want to be disciplined and drive value, and that is our motto going forward. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Got it. And then one question I have for you is in regards to the – Geoff, you mentioned like, in regards to the buyback, that you want to maintain flexibility. Should I interpret it as meaning that you are looking at some M&A? And if you can talk about a MIPS asset that's apparently on sale right now, is that something that you would be interested? Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yes. So again we don't want to go – we are not going to go into speculation, but clearly we have a very disciplined approach to M&A. We are not buying revenue. Very important is to fix and then further our strategy and then really drive the customer with differentiating products. And then attract the top talents, either managerial and technical talent we want to bring on board. And then we are very disciplined in term of return on investment. And then so far we have been very focused on internal developing, innovating products. That's evident by 20 new products in the last three years. In the first quarter, we already introduced three new products. So we continue doing that. And then only we see value and then fit into the strategy of our SDE, then we put the trigger on M&A. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Got it. And then one question on China. Can you talk about software piracy in China? Have you seen any effect of software piracy within semiconductor or in the systems design? Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yes. So I think clearly piracy, not just in China, in across the world, is happening. And so we are very focused on getting the value and protect our IP. And so that make sure that our tool and IP, our customer properly pay for it and then for the full value. And that's something we are believing in and we very disciplined on that. So if there's anything in piracy, we were definitely approaching the customer to make sure that they come clean and then pay up not just the past, and then going forward. And we want to make sure that we enforce that. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Got it. And my last question on Mentor Graphics acquisition by Siemens, have you seen any business impact where you've seen like divestitures or small businesses where Siemens has decided to get out of business? I just want to understand like if there's been any start-up change that you have – noticeable change that you have seen in regards to the acquisition of Mentor by Siemens? Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. So far I think we expect Mentor products continue to be competitive under the even bigger umbrella in Siemens ownership. We don't take it lightly. And so we continue to compete with them in the marketplace. And clearly it's $100 billion big giant. And we want to don't take it lightly. And then there are some good product we are competing with. And so far we continue to pay a lot of attention to them. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thank you. That's all I had. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. Operator The next question is from Tom Diffely from D.A. Davidson. Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co. Yeah. Good afternoon. I was hoping that you could look at your three new products and maybe rank, if you could, what the relative revenue opportunity is for each of them going forward, maybe both on a near-term and a long-term basis? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. Tom, this is Geoff. We don't give specifics on our different businesses at that level of detail. We don't give guidance on that. They're all going to be important products. Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co. All right. Okay. So I guess, Geoff, moving on to the margins, it looks like from your guidance here that the margins have to step up nicely in the second half of the year. Is that just stronger revenues? Is it going to be a mix issue? What drives the stronger margin profile? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. Generally if you look at, Tom, our trends over past couple of years, the second half of the year has been stronger than the first half of the year. Some of that is just what I'll call the normal ebb and flow of seasonality in the business. We have Social Security and Medicare taxes kick in at the beginning of the year. And as people reach those limits, those go away. We have more vacations tend to be in Q3 and in Q4 than they have early in the year. And those things contribute to keeping expenses down in the second half of the year or relatively flat. And then as our revenue has consistently grown, traditionally we drop more to the bottom line. Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co. Okay. Makes sense. And then I noticed – I look at some of the GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments, there's about $0.14 and then there was about a $0.07 tax on that $0.14. I'm curious, why is there such a kind of a heavy tax rate on those adjustments? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. Again for non-GAAP, we use a 23% non-GAAP tax rate when we give guidance and actually for our actuals. We look at that every couple of years and take a look at where we would expect to be if we didn't have any tax attribute and our company was operating in a normal tax environment. Traditionally, our cash taxes have been materially under that. Our GAAP tax rate will fluctuate materially based on all kinds of things, based on where income is earned, various different discrete items and tax. And so those things will fluctuate. I tend to focus on two things, the 23% that we use for non-GAAP and the cash tax rate. Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co. Okay. That makes sense. And then Lip-Bu, in your comments, you talked about the customer consolidation having minimal impact on 2017. Was that a comment that you expect the minimal impact going forward, or is that perhaps just 2017 and 2018 is perhaps a different story? Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. I don't think we are going to comment on 2018. We just stick to 2017. So far we see minimum impact. Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co. Okay. All right. Thank you for your time. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Thank you. Operator Our final question comes from Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities. Unknown Speaker Hi. This is Jason (46:38) on for Monika. Thanks for taking my question. I actually just have one question left. So if I look at Q2 guidance, you're guiding to $470 million to $480 million. If you take the midpoint of that quarter-over-quarter, that's going to be relatively flat. But we've historically seen a sequential increase from Q1 to Q2. Can you just talk about some of the dynamics on this? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Sure, Jason. As I think we mentioned on our February earnings call and I think earlier today, there's more variability in our business from quarter to quarter as our IP and hardware business should become more important to us. Those businesses have a more upfront component to them and so we're going to fluctuate from period to period and you're just seeing that from Q1 to Q2. Unknown Speaker Okay. Great. Thanks. That's my only question. Operator I will now turn the call over to Lip-Bu Tan for closing remarks. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. In closing, there are macro challenges ahead but also opportunities specific to Cadence. Through innovation and execution, we are well-positioned to build on our success, and to further proliferating our solutions with market-shaping customers. I'm pleased to note that for the third consecutive year, Cadence was named by Fortune Magazine as one of the top 100 companies to work for. I would like to thank all our shareholders, customers and partners, Board of Directors and hardworking employees globally for their continued support. Thank you, all, for joining us this afternoon.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator Your first question comes from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Overall a good quarter. I just had one question starting on kind of the digital side. It looks like that's seeing some lumpiness. It's up double digits last quarter and now it's kind of up singles. And on conversely as well, the IP business, it looks like it's now growing at double digits again. So could you maybe walk me through how we should expect that to shape out for the rest of the year in both of these segments? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yes. So on the digital side, Mitch, the actual revenue growth was close to 6% compared to Q1 of 2016. You're right, the apparent growth was lower than recent results. This was because in Q1 of 2016, included a large completed service contract, which was included in our digital and signoff product line. But we're seeing a lot of success in our digital and signoff products proliferating with market-shaping customers, and new customers are adopting these products. We expect good growth for 2017. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC Got it. Yeah. And then secondly on the IP side, seeing that growing at double-digits apparently, do you expect that to continue in 2017? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yes. We did have a onetime benefit from our IP business as we started recognizing royalties on a current quarter basis. But excluding that onetime benefit, our IP business still had strong growth in the mid-teens in Q1 over Q1. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Got it. Thank you very much. Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Great. Operator Your next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc. Thank you. Good evening. Lip-Bu, let me start with you and ask about opportunities you may have for incremental revenue and share in a number of respects. First of all, let's ask about geography. When we look at 2016 EDA industry results, there was a very substantial increase in China. We know how much of that was due to Mentor from the numbers in their 10-K, but that still left well over $200 million in revenues from China for everybody else. So perhaps you could talk about how you're doing there and what share progress you're making in China. Secondly, you highlighted a number of new products including Pegasus and Protium. Could you talk about how you think about the share opportunity with Pegasus? It's an enormous category that you're addressing, but by the same token it's historically proven to be very, very sticky for incumbent products. And then lastly on new products line, with respect to Protium, your revenues in FPGA prototyping to-date have been immaterial relative to what Synopsys is doing there, for example, with their HAPS products. So, again, similarly maybe you could talk about how you're thinking about the revenue or the share opportunity in that hardware category, then a couple for Geoff. Thanks. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah, Chris (17:45), thank you so much for the question. So a couple of things. One, I think you mentioned about the geographical. Clearly, the China is a great opportunity. We are well-positioned in China and we are very confident to continue to drive success and growth not only on the tool side and also the IP side. And China, as you know, the government is very committed to build up their domestic semiconductor industry with heavy investment. And we've done well in China. So we're going to continue. It's going to be a growth opportunity for us in China. And then regarding the new products, so couple of things that you highlight. Thank you for bringing it up. Pegasus, and this is very important for us to complete our digital and signoff flow. And as you – in the recall, we are building up quite a lot of the digital success with Innovus. I mentioned about 20% growth with a top 20 customer. And then we have Genus on the Synthesis side, and we have Signoff on Tempus and Voltus on Power. And then now, this physical verification become the missing piece, we are delighted to completely from ground up building up this product, massively parallel and cloud-ready and can scale up to 1,000 CPUs, and then drive 10x in terms of turnaround time. This is very, very significant. And we are delighted a couple of customer already support us, and we mentioned that in our script. And so this should be as exciting so that we have complete full flow opportunity for our customer to drive from – the Innovus and the place and route, all the way to physical verification. And, of course, working closely with our foundry partners are critical for the success. And then the other two new product we also have a successful launch, and that is on the verification part of our business. And then clearly, it's very exciting for us to complete our whole verification suite. As you'll recall, we have the JasperGold. That is very strong position in the formal verification. We have hardware, Z1 have been very strong for emulation. And what we like to do is basically to really complete that with the FPGA prototyping. And this is something that can scale up to 600 million gates. And then using the same compiler as the Z1 hardware emulation, so the customer can really go from prototyping all the way to massive scaling in term of emulation. And then the other part is in our simulation tool to – with the acquisition of Rocketick. They provide very, very strong parallel simulator, and that engine can be very – we fully integrate it with (20:50) called Xcelium. This is a first production-ready parallel simulator, very well-received with the customer. And we're delighted so that we can complete the whole verification suite to provide to our customer. On the Protium FPGA side, we have Xylene and Mellanox with us and plus a few others. And then – so it's a very early state, but people are really excited about it. We are very positive about that. Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc. You highlighted a number of end markets that you're focusing on like auto, aero and defense and so forth. Could you again remind us how you're organizing yourselves to address those markets in terms of teams or sales or anything out that kind? And then one of the persistent issues for you and for EDA historically has always been, particularly when you've had active new product periods, is having sufficient AE capacity. And maybe you could address that issue, how you're doing there, and having the requisite support in AEs and so forth that you think you're going to need, given the multiple new product ramps that you now have to manage? Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. Thank you so much for the question. This is very much related to our strategy of System Design Enablement. And this is really providing not just the core EDA strength of our increased adoption and not only the IP strategy for the scalable growth, but more important right now, we are moving into some of the emerging new growth area. We've highlight a couple of them. This is automotive, the massive data center, and then the machine learning-related and then apply into some of this vertical market that we are going after. Thank you for bringing it up. We have very, very focused on the aerospace and defense. Over the last few quarters, we highlight Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems and also GE Aviation that we are very deeply engaged with them. And then same thing with automotive, and we've mentioned up (23:03) Mobileye using our Palladium Z1 for automotive vision and also Infineon for the automotive function safety. And stay tuned, we do right now (23:16) have a dedicated team to focus on the automotive and a dedicated team to focus for aviation and defense. And so some of this vertical beside providing the tool, the IP, the emulation, but more important, we're going to learn what their new requirements are, and then we're going to be starting to pick up the area that we need to either organically growing or through acquisition to provide the total solution to our customer in the system and then somewhat the vertical market that we are pursuing. Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc. All right. But again, just to pick on this point. You're saying in effect that field support, AEs, all that sort of thing that historically has been a constraint for EDA when ramping new products is not an issue for you right now or a manageable one? Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. So what we did is basically continue the AE support. It's very important for someone's (24:16) success. But we relocate and then we rearrange and then recruit somewhat the talent on the AE side for some of defense, aerospace and automotive, and then continue to drive efficiency. So in some way we are driving the efficiency of the AE support to our current customer and put more resources in some of this vertical market and to support their success. Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc. Thank you, Lip-Bu. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a few of them. First one, Geoff, just wanted to find out why no buybacks this quarter? Like you guys have been doing it at a very consistent pace for the last three years. So I'm kind of surprised why there was no buyback. And is there any reasoning behind it? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. So when we announced the program in the Q1 or the Q4 earnings call in February timeframe, we said we're going to be more flexible with this most recent authorization. We're sticking to that. Don't take any other messages besides we're being more flexible. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got you. So it's not like you are constrained by certain, like, events or something. It's just more your own choice? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. We're just going to be more flexible moving forward. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got you. All right. And then a follow-up on the ASC 606 rev rec, so you guys are still confident that you can maintain the 90% ratable revenue that you have. I'm kind of curious, A, is that still the case? And if there is a risk of that ratable revenue going away, how much of the 90% do you think would be at risk? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yes. So we are going to implement a new standard, as you know, ASC 606 in 2018. We are confident that we will substantially maintain recurring revenue treatment for the language or in a language of the new standard revenue over time treatment. We're not committing to a particular percentage right now. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got you. But a significant portion of the 90% can be... Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Or substantially maintain, I think, is the keyword, substantially maintain. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got you. All right. And then on the IP revenue side, I had a two-part question. One is, what do you think the IP revenue or the IP business for the overall industry growth this year, is it still a 15% to 20% growth business? And for you specifically, of your IP revenues, how much is upfront versus ratable? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. So, upfront versus ratable, a lot of them we issue a license, and we would recognize the revenue when we deliver the license. Sometimes we do longer-term deals and those too can be recognized over time, essentially when we take over, for example, somebody's roadmap for a particular type of IP. And then royalties are booked now when our customers ship the product and we recognize royalties over that. And we've never really communicated the percentage of IPs that's recurring or not. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got you. All right. Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. And we anticipate we're going to have double-digit growth for this year overall on the IP business, low double digits. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Just to add on to what Geoff is talking about, clearly we have this refinement of the IP business to drive profitability and scalability. And we are very much on track of that, and then so double-digit growth. And then the outsourcing trend is continue. And that create opportunity for us. And then clearly we are focused on standardized, off-the-shelf IP, strategic vertical market and most advanced process node and top customer. So we really drive quality revenue with the top customer. That is our focus. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got you. That's very helpful. And then two last quick questions. One is, what is the weighted average contract life in the quarter? And did you guys have any revenues from FPGA prototyping? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. So yes, we had revenue from FPGA prototyping and Protium S1. It was our first quarter of release to market, so we're excited about the revenue. And Lip-Bu mentioned a couple of the customers that we've already recognized business with. The weighted average contract life, since we stopped on our Q1 earnings call giving bookings guidance, we're also not giving the weighted average contract life anymore. We don't think it's really relevant, and we're concentrated on deal quality, not on those two metrics. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch All right. Thank you. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Thank you. Operator And the next question is from Rich Valera from Needham & Company. Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC Thank you. Question on the emulation market. Historically, new emulation products releases by yourself and Mentor have had pretty meaningful impacts on the growth rate of your respective emulation businesses. It looks like Mentor just released their new Strato platform this quarter. So still very early there. But, one, could you say, have you seen it in the market? Do you have any sense of how that backs up competitively if it changes the competitive dynamics? And do you think it has any impact on the market or do you think maybe the market's matured enough and is big enough now that it doesn't necessarily have the same impact as it might have in the past? Thank you. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. Richard, this is Lip-Bu. Let me start first. Clearly, this emulation business continue to be good. Last year, we announced Z1. We have a phenomenal first full year, and then with 29 new Palladium logos. And first quarter, we continue to sell well. We have seven new customer, I mentioned, and then also seven make repeat orders, so very strong Q1. So we expect to be a strong year for 2017. Regarding the Mentor announcing their new product, we haven't seen them in the marketplace or customer. And we stay tuned and we keep a close eye on it. And so clearly the emulation business for the most advanced node and complex design is a must-have in term of time to market to verification. We continue to see strong customer interest in our Z1. And then many customers doubled, tripled down the capacity scale, and it's phenomenal. So we are excited about it. Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. And as far as Q1 was concerned, it was roughly flat to Q4. And as we said last time, we still expect a strong year for hardware. But, of course, you realize you were coming off of a record year, will make the year-over-year comps difficult, but we still expect a very strong year in hardware. Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC That's helpful. Thank you. And then you've mentioned a couple of markets, particularly auto – I guess a combination of auto or more specifically ADAS, and then IoT, and I think AI as well. I'm just wondering, aside from IP, where I'm assuming you probably have some, call it, vertically-focused IP from maybe some of these markets, can you talk about your other efforts at putting together sort of vertically focused solutions and what that's comprised of, and what kind of success you've had at sort of vertically targeting these certain markets? Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. So let me try to address that. Clearly, automotive is a faster growing area for us. We are excited about it. And so we mentioned in our earnings script, we are delighted on the Renesas expanded engagement. And a lot with the tools and Innovus and the custom, the advanced-node and also the verification suite. We also mentioned quite a bit on the design IP front. We have a very big contract and with a very big automotive component company. And we are excited about it, and this is on the IP front, on the design IP. And then clearly, we continue to focus on the function safety that we mentioned about Infineon. We're focused on the reliability and simulation side, and also on the emulation side with the Mobileye. And so this a major focus. We have a dedicated team to drive the success. And we can learn a lot in the automotive space working with the Tier 1, the automotive manufacturers directly, and so they're understanding their requirement so that we can provide them a total solution, not just a tool, not just a IP, and also provide them what they need in term of Tensilica, the Vision and ADAS requirement, and then working with the sensor companies. And either its LADAR or LIDAR or even some of the laser approach and to drive the level 4, level 5 autonomous driving. And we're heavily engaging with all the above. Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC Got it. Thank you, Lip-Bu. Just one more for Geoff, if I could. Geoff, can you give us a sense of what your cash tax rate is right now and how you think that could be impacted? I mean, if you just pick a theoretical, whether it's 15% or 25% rate, if the federal rate was changed, how that would or wouldn't affect the cash taxes you might pay? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. We obviously haven't released our Q for Q1, but for last year, our cash tax rate was between 10% and 15%, varied a little bit from quarter to quarter. And how it's going to go in the future is your guess is as good as ours. Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC Got it. Okay. Thanks very much gentlemen. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Thank you. Operator The next question is from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I wanted to follow on the emulation question. You mentioned that it's still selling strongly. But given the quarter-over-quarter comparison. Just wondering, is that just seasonality or is there any lead time issues, or have we actually seen the peak in this cycle and we're starting to enter the tail? Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. So I think, Sterling, let me start first. So far, we don't see the peak clearly from our customer. We are heavily engaged with the customer. They want to have more. Actually the scalability is critical. We are excited working with the top-tier customer and meet their requirement. And this is something that's very important to them in term of their design – complex design to verify and that they really like it. And so far, we continue to see strong demand from our customer. And then meanwhile right now, we also have the FPGA version. This is a Protium using the same compiler, and then can scale up to 600 million gates, and that can effectively compete with the other competitors. And so we have a two-pronged approach. And then using same compiler, the customer can stay with us on both front on the emulation and FPGA front. Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. And again, I think we continue to see emulation being a secular trend, right, that would benefit clearly us, but perhaps our competitors – certainly our competitors also, but it's a secular trend. It will be lumpy though. It will go up and down for a period of time, but secular trend still continues, Sterling. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC That's fair. And, Geoff, you touched upon the variability given the IP in the hardware. Just trying to put the model together and get it to triangulate, is it fair to say that in the quarter that the time-based license or time-based ratable revenue was actually less than 90% in the quarter? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. It was approximately 90%. It's been consistently for a very long time for us. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then last question, I wasn't clear, you may have mentioned, Geoff, early on in terms of the IP business that unless I misheard it that there were some onetime items. I'm just – if you can give us some more color on that front in particular. And then you talked about the strength in automotive around IP. Is that something you could turn around and see the same customers come back for additional IP rights on top of it? Or how should we think about the timing of repeat purchases from customers in that space? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. So we did have a onetime benefit, one onetime benefit related to recognizing royalties, Tensilica royalties on a current quarter basis. Even excluding that, our IP business grew mid-teens year-over-year. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. And we mentioned about two big opportunity for us. One is we just signed and booked the largest design IP contract with the automotive semiconductor sector, and then also a major Asian semiconductor adopting the Tensilica for the mobile products. So overall we are excited about IP, and our refined strategy is working. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. Thank you, guys. Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Thank you. Operator The next question is from Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thanks for taking my question. My first question, Lip-Bu, is like if I look at your growth and your year-over-year growth the last few years, every year it has been decelerating. And it's now at about 6% this year. I just wanted to understand like how do you think about the long-term growth of the business? Is it more like a 5% growth business over next few years? And what is really needed to make it more like a 10% growth? Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Okay. Good question, Farhan. Couple of points. First of all, we are confident with our strategy and direction of the business and the future opportunity. We are pleased with the revenue growth for this year, 6%, with the order mix environment that we are operating in. And I think a couple of things that are good driver for us. Our core EDA software is doing well, growing with all the new product we came out. And then the IPs rebound to 10% growth rate. And then the hardware continue to be a good year this year for us. So I think overall I think we are pleased with what we see in the marketplace, and that's why we guided 6%. And in terms of the trend are going down, clearly, we are mission-critical solution to our customer. And I think we continue to drive value and very disciplined in what we provide to our customer. I strongly believe collaborating deeply with the customer, deliver innovative product to meet their challenger's design. And then the other part and I think they are going to help us to grow the business in terms of revenue growth will be the system design enablement. And that's where we are moving into some of the vertical area and then the vertical market. And then addressing some of the higher growth opportunity in automotive, data center and then the aerospace and defense-related area. And again, the chip design is getting more and more complex. We are very mission-critical, and the design and verification is getting a lot more complex. And we can drive a lot more value. And that's why we want to be disciplined and drive value, and that is our motto going forward. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Got it. And then one question I have for you is in regards to the – Geoff, you mentioned like, in regards to the buyback, that you want to maintain flexibility. Should I interpret it as meaning that you are looking at some M&A? And if you can talk about a MIPS asset that's apparently on sale right now, is that something that you would be interested? Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yes. So again we don't want to go – we are not going to go into speculation, but clearly we have a very disciplined approach to M&A. We are not buying revenue. Very important is to fix and then further our strategy and then really drive the customer with differentiating products. And then attract the top talents, either managerial and technical talent we want to bring on board. And then we are very disciplined in term of return on investment. And then so far we have been very focused on internal developing, innovating products. That's evident by 20 new products in the last three years. In the first quarter, we already introduced three new products. So we continue doing that. And then only we see value and then fit into the strategy of our SDE, then we put the trigger on M&A. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Got it. And then one question on China. Can you talk about software piracy in China? Have you seen any effect of software piracy within semiconductor or in the systems design? Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yes. So I think clearly piracy, not just in China, in across the world, is happening. And so we are very focused on getting the value and protect our IP. And so that make sure that our tool and IP, our customer properly pay for it and then for the full value. And that's something we are believing in and we very disciplined on that. So if there's anything in piracy, we were definitely approaching the customer to make sure that they come clean and then pay up not just the past, and then going forward. And we want to make sure that we enforce that. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Got it. And my last question on Mentor Graphics acquisition by Siemens, have you seen any business impact where you've seen like divestitures or small businesses where Siemens has decided to get out of business? I just want to understand like if there's been any start-up change that you have – noticeable change that you have seen in regards to the acquisition of Mentor by Siemens? Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. So far I think we expect Mentor products continue to be competitive under the even bigger umbrella in Siemens ownership. We don't take it lightly. And so we continue to compete with them in the marketplace. And clearly it's $100 billion big giant. And we want to don't take it lightly. And then there are some good product we are competing with. And so far we continue to pay a lot of attention to them. Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thank you. That's all I had. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. Operator The next question is from Tom Diffely from D.A. Davidson. Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co. Yeah. Good afternoon. I was hoping that you could look at your three new products and maybe rank, if you could, what the relative revenue opportunity is for each of them going forward, maybe both on a near-term and a long-term basis? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. Tom, this is Geoff. We don't give specifics on our different businesses at that level of detail. We don't give guidance on that. They're all going to be important products. Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co. All right. Okay. So I guess, Geoff, moving on to the margins, it looks like from your guidance here that the margins have to step up nicely in the second half of the year. Is that just stronger revenues? Is it going to be a mix issue? What drives the stronger margin profile? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. Generally if you look at, Tom, our trends over past couple of years, the second half of the year has been stronger than the first half of the year. Some of that is just what I'll call the normal ebb and flow of seasonality in the business. We have Social Security and Medicare taxes kick in at the beginning of the year. And as people reach those limits, those go away. We have more vacations tend to be in Q3 and in Q4 than they have early in the year. And those things contribute to keeping expenses down in the second half of the year or relatively flat. And then as our revenue has consistently grown, traditionally we drop more to the bottom line. Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co. Okay. Makes sense. And then I noticed – I look at some of the GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments, there's about $0.14 and then there was about a $0.07 tax on that $0.14. I'm curious, why is there such a kind of a heavy tax rate on those adjustments? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. Again for non-GAAP, we use a 23% non-GAAP tax rate when we give guidance and actually for our actuals. We look at that every couple of years and take a look at where we would expect to be if we didn't have any tax attribute and our company was operating in a normal tax environment. Traditionally, our cash taxes have been materially under that. Our GAAP tax rate will fluctuate materially based on all kinds of things, based on where income is earned, various different discrete items and tax. And so those things will fluctuate. I tend to focus on two things, the 23% that we use for non-GAAP and the cash tax rate. Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co. Okay. That makes sense. And then Lip-Bu, in your comments, you talked about the customer consolidation having minimal impact on 2017. Was that a comment that you expect the minimal impact going forward, or is that perhaps just 2017 and 2018 is perhaps a different story? Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Yeah. I don't think we are going to comment on 2018. We just stick to 2017. So far we see minimum impact. Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co. Okay. All right. Thank you for your time. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Thank you. Operator Our final question comes from Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities. Unknown Speaker Hi. This is Jason (46:38) on for Monika. Thanks for taking my question. I actually just have one question left. So if I look at Q2 guidance, you're guiding to $470 million to $480 million. If you take the midpoint of that quarter-over-quarter, that's going to be relatively flat. But we've historically seen a sequential increase from Q1 to Q2. Can you just talk about some of the dynamics on this? Geoffrey G. Ribar - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Sure, Jason. As I think we mentioned on our February earnings call and I think earlier today, there's more variability in our business from quarter to quarter as our IP and hardware business should become more important to us. Those businesses have a more upfront component to them and so we're going to fluctuate from period to period and you're just seeing that from Q1 to Q2. Unknown Speaker Okay. Great. Thanks. That's my only question. Operator I will now turn the call over to Lip-Bu Tan for closing remarks. Lip-Bu Tan - Cadence Design Systems, Inc. In closing, there are macro challenges ahead but also opportunities specific to Cadence. Through innovation and execution, we are well-positioned to build on our success, and to further proliferating our solutions with market-shaping customers. I'm pleased to note that for the third consecutive year, Cadence was named by Fortune Magazine as one of the top 100 companies to work for. I would like to thank all our shareholders, customers and partners, Board of Directors and hardworking employees globally for their continued support. Thank you, all, for joining us this afternoon.

Our press release and slides for today\'s call are posted on the Investor Relations\' pages of our website at cdw.com. Supporting materials on the Investor Relations\' page are under the heading, entitled "Webcast." In connection with the merger agreement relating to the proposed acquisition of CDW by an affiliate of Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC and Providence Equity Partners Incorporated, we have filed a definitive proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange commission and the proxy statement had been mailed to shareholders of record of the company as of July 5, 2007. Before making any voting decision shareholders are urged to carefully read the proxy statement regarding the merger, in its entirety, because it will contain important information about the proposed merger. A copy of this transcript is being filed with the SEC at proxy\'s listing materials relating to the meeting of shareholders to consider the merger agreement and additional information can be found in the definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC relating to that proposed transaction. So with that let me turn it back to John. John Edwardson Thank you, Barb. As Barb mentioned and as most of you on the call probably know we previously announced the merger agreement that provides for the acquisition of CDW by an affiliate of Madison Dearborn Partners and Providence Equity Partners. To summarize upon closing of the merger CDW will be controlled by investment funds affiliated with Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC and Providence Equity Partners Inc. We will be holding a special meeting of our shareholders on August 9, 2007 to vote on the merger agreement and we filed our definitive proxy statement with the SEC on July 13, 2007. Since we are in a proxy solicitation period relating to the pending merger transaction, we will not be holding a Q&A session on our call today. Details of the transaction can be found on the proxy statement. We currently expect to complete the merger on the second half of the third quarter or early on the fourth quarter of 2007. With that please turn to slide 5 of the webcast presentation that compares our financial results for the second quarter of 2007, to the second quarter of 2006. Thanks to our CDW coworkers\' efforts we achieved a record quarterly revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share on the second quarter of 2007. Total revenue increased 24.4% to $2.03 billion and includes approximately $153 million from Berbee. Excluding Berbee and therefore on a non-GAAP basis, total revenue was $1.88 billion, an increase of 15.1% compared to the prior year period. Gross profit increased 24.2% to $328 million and gross profit margin was 16.1% of revenue. I\'d like to mention that during the second quarter of 2007 we incurred cost related to our pending merger of $8.0 million pre-tax and $4.9 million after tax. Our press release includes a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures. Operating income increased 14.7% to $124 million and operating margin was 6.1% of revenue. Non-GAAP operating income which excludes merger related cost to the $8 million pre-tax and as explained in our press release increased 22.1% to $132 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 6.5% of revenue. Net income increased 9.5% to $80 million. Net income on a non-GAAP basis which once again excludes the merger related cost of $4.9 million after tax, and as explained in our press release increased 16.3% to $85 million. Diluted earnings per share were $0.99 compared to $0.91 last year representing an 8.8% increase. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis which excludes the merger related cost at $8 million pre-tax and $4.9 million after tax and once again as explained in our press release were $1.05, which represented a 15.4% increase compared to last year. Our performance this quarter represents the continued execution of our existing strategies. We continue to remain focused on growing our revenue profitability, optimizing margins and keeping SG&A cost under control. Annualized revenue per coworker declined to $1.41 million in the second quarter of 2007, from $1.49 million in the second quarter of 2006. Annualized gross profit per coworker also declined the $228,000 in the second quarter of 2007 from $240,000 in the second quarter of 2006. The decrease in these metrics is primarily due to the increased number of sales force coworkers over the past three quarters and the fact that Berbee has less revenue per coworker. Slide 6 shows our return on equity and return on invested capital. In the second quarter of 2007, we achieved return on equity of 20.7% and return on invested capital of 31.4% including Berbee. Barb will give you more detail on these metrics later in her presentation. Berbee had solid performance this quarter as demand for unified communications solutions among Berbee customers remained strong. In addition, Berbee experienced continued strength in its server and storage business. Due to its more projects-oriented business model, Berbee\'s growth rate can be more variable compared to our corporate and public sectors. Once again, I would like to recognize the outstanding efforts of all of our CDW and Berbee coworkers. Thank you for remaining focused on providing unmatched service to our customers and helping them identify the right technology to enhance their business performance. Jim Shanks will now discuss revenue results for the sales force related items, Harry Harczak, will review product trends and Barb Klein will give you more financial information later in her presentation. Jim Shanks Thank you, John. In the second quarter of 2007 total corporate sector segment sales were $1.237 billion representing an 11.2% increase over last year. Average daily sales in the second quarter of 2007 were $19.321 million compared to $17.373 million in the second quarter of 2006, which was also an increase of 11.2%. On an average daily sales basis the corporate sector increased 12.3% in April, 10.5% in May and 11.1% in June. The public sector segment generated total sales of $643.6 million in the second quarter of 2007, which was a 23.4% increase from the second quarter of 2006. Average daily sales were $10.056 million in the second quarter of 2007 compared to $8.150 million in the second quarter of 2006, also representing a 23.4% increase from the prior year. On an average daily sales basis, the public sector grew 19.0% in April, 26.9% in May and 25.1% in June. In the second quarter of 2007, all customer channels within the public sector had profitable double-digit sales growth, including federal government, state and local government, education and healthcare. On June 30, 2007 our sales force including Berbee numbered 2722 coworkers. This compares to 2589 sales coworkers on December 31, 2006 including Berbee and 2179 sales coworkers on June 30, 2006. Nearly 350 advanced technology specialists are included in the sales force for the second quarter of 2007. And we are on track to reach our goal of adding approximately 350 to 400 net new sales force co-workers in 2007. Turning to slide 7 we show average daily sales, per average sales force coworker which includes Berbee. For the second quarter of 2007 average daily sales, per average sales force coworker were approximately $11,800, compared to approximately $11,900 for the second quarter of 2006. Slide 8 shows gross profit dollars on an average daily basis including Berbee. Average daily gross profit dollars per average sales force coworker were approximately $1,900 for the second quarter of 2007 compared to approximately $1920 for the second quarter of 2006. In the second quarter of 2007 the percentage of sales force turnover based on a trailing 12 months was in the low 20s compared to the mid 20s one year ago. Slide 9 shows that the web generated approximately $589 million in direct online sales for the second quarter of 2007, representing a 19.3% increase compared to the same period a year ago. Online sales in the second quarter of 2007 comprised 31.3% of total sales excluding Berbee. Berbee sales are not generated on the web due to the high service component of these sales. Harry will now comment on product trends. Harry Harczak Thank you, Jim and good morning. Turning to slide 10, we compare our product mix for the second quarter of 2007 to our product mix for the second quarter of 2006. As a reminder, our second quarter of 2007 product sales include Berbee product sales, which primarily impact the netcomm, server and data storage categories. In the second quarter of 2007, netcomm slightly exceeded software to become our largest product category comprising 16.1% of sales. Software was second at 15.6%, desktop and servers was third at 13.9%, data storage fourth at 13% and notebooks and accessories was fifth at 12.4%. Slide 11 shows product category growth rates. Sales growth for netcomm products was 92.1%. Berbee contributed significantly to the netcomm category growth rate due to its focus on Cisco\'s advanced technologies and Voice over IP security and wireless. CDW sales of netcomm products excluding Berbee also had significant double-digit growth. Growth was driven by sales of networking switches, security hardware and network routers, which accelerated in the second quarter of 2007 due to the Cisco Gold Authorization we received in the first quarter of 2007 for the corporate sector. We now have Cisco Gold Authorization for all three operating segments, which allows us to offer a broad array of Cisco products to all CDW customers, including Voice-over-IP and certain high-end routers and switches. From not significant in terms of total sales dollars telephony sales which are included in the netcomm category exhibited strong growth in the second quarter due to the Cisco Gold Authorization as well as leveraging our specialist team. Sales of the combined category of desktops and servers, which include Berbee server sales increased 27.3% in the second quarter of 2007 compared to the prior year period. While the inclusion of Berbee\'s server sales added significantly to the category\'s growth, both CDW server and CDW desktop sales excluding Berbee had double-digit growth. Sales of data storage devices increased 19.8% and include Berbee sales. Customers continue to store larger amounts of data, protect against threats of data loss comply with increasing government legislation and increase their access in secure stored data. Greater adoption of disk space storage versus tape has also continued. The combined notebooks and accessories product category increased 15.9%, driven by strong notebook sales which represent most of the category. Software sales which include Berbee increased 13.2% versus the prior year period. Key grows drivers for desktop publishing and graphics, network communication driven by virtualization in securities software. We also had strong sales in Microsoft Enterprise Agreements for which we received a commission but did not include as revenue in the software category. We did not see significant adoption of Microsoft Vista by our customers in the second quarter 2007. In May of 2007, we released the results of our second Microsoft Windows Vista Tracking Poll. We found the majority of survey respondents are not using or evaluating Windows Vista at this time. However, those who are testing and evaluating Windows Vista, the majority plan to implement Windows Vista within the next 12 months. CDW plans to conduct a third round of the survey later in 2007. In the meantime, we\'ll continue to promote Vista and educate our customers as they prepare their adoption plans. Sales of video products increased 8.8%, while we experienced strong double-digit unit growth in the category average selling prices continue to decline significantly. Products experiencing the strongest demand included the medical displays, larger screen desktop displays specifically in the 20" to 29" category, touch screen displays and video accessories, such as video cards. Demand continues to increase for wide desktop LCD monitors that support Vista\'s wide monitor format. This trend has also increased sales of video cards and memory upgrades to support the wide video format. Projectors and related accessories grew at double-digit rate due to strength in the education segment. Sales of memory products rose 6.9%. Customers continue to add high performance memory products to desktops and notebooks to maximize their systems. The category is also being driven by customers adopting virtualization software and database application in seeking to increase performance on dual and quad-core systems. Memory products play a key role in our efforts to the attach products to anchor product categories. Sales of input devices grew 6.5%. The category continues to be driven by barcode scanners for point of sale and warehouse applications. Printer sales increased 1.3%, while ongoing customer migration to multifunction and laser printers drove our unit growth, average selling prices continued to decline. We are seeing steady growth in the thermal printing area, as we target point-of-sale and warehouse solutions for our customers. We remain focused on our customer penetration program to target existing customers who have not purchased printers from us before and are working closely with our partners as they launch new products and work to accelerate the category. Slide 12, shows the change in revenue, unit volume and average selling prices for notebook CPUs, and desktop and server CPUs, excluding Berbee sales. Notebook CPU sales increased 17.9% and unit volume was up 20.2%, while the average selling price decreased slightly by 1.9% from the year ago. Sales were strong for most of our top brands and we continue to experience solid demand based primarily on the replacement of desktops with notebooks. As the price differential between desktops and notebooks has stabilized, we focused on up-selling customers more feature-rich products such as ruggedised notebooks. Sales of PC tablets also supported the category\'s results. Our focus on customer penetration continues, which emphasizes selling notebooks to existing customers who have not previously purchased notebooks from us. Sales from desktop computers and servers excluding Berbee grew 19.5%, while unit volume increased 13.9%. The average selling price increased 5% from the prior period. We had double-digit sales growth in the server category, which reflected customer\'s continued option for blade servers and multi-core servers. Customers continue to consolidate and use virtualization technology as a business solution to improve the efficiency and productivity. Desktop sales also produced double-digit results this quarter. The product mix continued to shift towards higher-end work stations with dual core processors, added memory, and upgraded video cards, which helped to offset the continued decline of average selling prices of desktops. We continue to promote our customer penetration program, which is a primary contributor towards success in the desktop category. Barb Klein will now review our financial results. Barb Klein Thank you, Harry. As John stated in the second quarter of 2007, we set new quarterly records for sales, gross profit, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share. Gross profit margin was 16.1% of sales in the second quarter of 2007 compared to 16.2% of sales in the second quarter of 2006 and within our stated objective range of 15.5% to 16.2%, gross profit margin of 16.2% in the first quarter of 2007. Slide 13 shows our operating statistics. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 8.5% in the second quarter of 2007, compared to 7.7% in the second quarter of 2006, an increase of $45.9 million. The increase in selling and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2007 was primarily due to the inclusion of Berbee\'s operating expenses, increased payroll costs as a result of continued investments in expanding CDW\'s sales force, and cost related to the previously announced merger agreement. Selling and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2007 included approximately $8 million pre-tax of merger related costs. Excluding these merger related costs and therefore on a non-GAAP basis, selling and administrative expenses were 8.1% of sales in the second quarter of 2007. Selling and administrative expenses were 8.3% in the first quarter of 2007. Advertising expense was $32.2 million or 1.6% of sales in the second quarter 2007 compared to $30 million or 1.8% of sales in the second quarter of 2006. Operating margin was 6.1% in the second quarter of 2007 compared to 6.6% in the second quarter of 2006. Excluding merger related cost of $8 million pre-tax and therefore on a non-GAAP basis operating margin was 6.5% in the second quarter of 2007. Our stated objectives for operating margin is in a range of 6% to 6.4%, therefore excluding the merger related cost, the operating margin was slightly better than the objective range in the second quarter 2007. We achieved solid revenue and profitability this quarter. Corporate sector revenue growth improved, gross margin was solid and selling, general and administrative expenses were well controlled. While we continue to expect to add a net new 350 to 400 sales force coworkers across the sales organization in 2007 plus additional engineers for Berbee, we will continue to tightly control costs increases in other areas of the business. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2007 was 38.0% compared to 35.4% for the second quarter 2006. The tax rate in the second quarter of 2006 was favorably impacted by a benefit of $2.3 million related to the resolution of an audit of the company\'s 2003 federal income tax return, which did not repeat in the second quarter of 2007. Due to our Board\'s consideration of strategic alternatives as detailed in the proxy statement related to the shareholder meeting to be held with respect to the merger agreement, we did not repurchase any share of the company stock in the second quarter 2007. Berbee was $0.03 per share accretive to the second quarter of 2007 diluted earning per share, net of lower interest income as a result of the purchase. Turning to the balance sheet, inventory turns on an annualized basis were 26 times in the second quarter of 2007 compared to 23 times in the second quarter of 2006. Berbee positively impacted inventory turnover in the second quarter 2007 by approximately 1.5 days. Berbee has a predominantly drop-ship model due to the types of products it sells. If Berbee\'s impact to inventory turns consensually have a greater degree of variability from quarter-to-quarter. Therefore our inventory turn up objective remains at 23 to 24 turns on an annualized basis. Accounts receivables, days sales outstanding were 41 days at the end of the second quarter of 2007 compared to 38 days at the end of the second quarter 2006. Berbee impacted the metrics by approximately one day, because of billing and delivery of projects is spread out over longer period of time compared to CDW\'s more transactional business. Our DSO target is a range of 40 to 42 days including Berbee. As of June 30, 2007, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $580 million. In the second quarter of 2007, cash flow from operations was approximately $195 million and capital expenditures were approximately $26 million. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million in 2007. John mentioned that in the second quarter of 2007, we achieved return on equity 20.7% and return on invested capital of 31.4% including Berbee, which is shown in slide 6. Both ROE and ROIC are calculated on a trailing fourth quarters\' basis. The addition of Berbee and our purchase of the Western Distribution Center in the fourth quarter of 2006 increased the average total assets while decreasing cash, which resulted in a lower ROIC for the fourth quarter of 2006, first quarter of 2007 and second quarter of 2007 as compared to previous quarters.   Turning to segment results, corporate sector sales increased 11.2% and operating income increased 10% in the second quarter of 2007, compared to the prior year period. Operating income for the corporate sector increased primarily due to revenue growth and an increase in gross margin which was partially offset by investment and selling resources.   Corporate sector operating margin was 7.9% in the second quarter of 2007, compared to 8% in the second quarter of 2006 and 8% in the first quarter of 2006. Public sector sales increased 23.4% and operating income increased to 25% in the second quarter of 2007, compared to the prior year period.   Operating income for the public sector increased primarily due revenue growth. Public sector operating margin was 5.6% in both the second quarter of 2007and the second quarter of 2006 and was 5.1% in the first quarter of 2007. While we did not own Berbee\'s prior to October 11th 2006, we are providing Berbee sales growth for comparative purposes, which was 50.1% in the second quarter of 2007 versus the prior year period. Berbee\'s operating margin was 3.8% in the second quarter of 2006 and 3.6% in the first quarter, sorry 3.8% in the second quarter of 2007 and 3.6% in the third quarter of 2007. As a reminder Berbee\'s operating margin is lower than the other segments due to the higher proportion of services in its business. Berbee\'s operating income also includes the amortization expense related to intangible assets. Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the call back to John.

Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference 2017 May 31, 2017 04:00 PM ET Executives Mark Alles - Chief Executive Officer Analysts Ronny Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein Ronny Gal Thank you very much for making it. My first introduction to Mark was when I showed up at the breakout session that the Company had at J. P. Morgan. And even then the name says on and was raising about how evil the men at the CBM are. And I could be opposite position that we got into an argument, and gets everybody around the table again to look at them, we decided that why are you arguing with them, which made me turn around and asked him, hi, I’m Ronny Gal, do you want to say. And at least I knew who I was at that point, but we also learned that Seals and Marine officer before early in his carrier and having served in a similar unit can certainly appreciate the feistiness that comes from -- that come back on. Based on the Celgene preference, we’re going to start with a short statement by Mark about where the Company is today. And then I'm going to start through Q&A that kind of go through the major franchise and ask some general questions. And happy to take questions, there are cards on the table, please feel free to pass them on and somebody will come from the back and take them up. In the end of the 45-50 minutes we’ve got, I'm going to talk couple of things before end and see if anybody wants to just get out and ask questions directly. And if that’s okay, Mark thank you for being here. Mark Alles Thanks. I'm not surprised though that we have a military background that we shutdown and we had an argument about something that we really agreed on, but had a different perspective about the value creation, so really great to be with you today. Mark Alles, I'm the CEO of Celgene. I've been with the Company for 13.5 years. So through a period of I think explosive growth, and I just wanted to remind investors before we start the Q&A, that the Company is mission driven. We focus on some key thoughts and key principles that we built the Company around and continue to build the Company around and that is that especially in a world of Managed Care, a world of cost effectiveness and the paired environment, we look to discover, develop and commercialize those innovative therapies, in other words, innovation gets thrown around a lot incremental versus clear difference. But innovation where a high unmet medical needs in cancer and increasingly, we talk about inflammation, but it's really immunology. We’re looking to discover, develop and commercialize those medicines that make a huge difference for the actual patients with serious diseases. In that context, we are most known as a hematology company; so a blood cancer company in myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia, et cetera and a portfolio of market leading drugs in myeloma and increasingly other areas of blood cancers. Our solid tumor franchise is really led by ABRAXANE, a drug that is one of the very few drugs that has ever produced the survival advantage for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. This is also a product that physicians right now in the I/O revolution, the checkpoint inhibitor revolution in combination with PDL1 for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. So some data should be coming soon that tells us whether that combination is important or not for lung cancer. When we think about what else is happening in our portfolio, we move quickly to our inflammatory franchise. In the last two years, we’ve turned Otezla, our drug for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, into a bonafide blockbuster. We positioned it before Biologics, this was a lot running if you remember our discussion about the payer, a lot of that was positioning pre-biologic and then its investors took notice to Otezla in the first quarter, we actually had a significant impact on the performance of the brand, but more mechanically than fundamentally, that is that at the end of the 2016, we executed contracts with some of the major insurance Managed Care plans in the U.S. that caused the associated gross to net change on the rebates that we provided. So this gave us access in a biological step free environment, meaning there was not a requirement for patient to be exposed to a biologic for psoriasis or for arthritis before they would be eligible for an Otezla script. So this was an important access step for the brand and we increased the covered universe by about 100 million lives of people who would have step free access to the product. This is a bonafide blockbuster and I can tell you coming out of Q1 into Q2, we've seen a nice volume recovery, we've seen the prescription volume in the market in the U.S. grow, and we're launching right now in Japan and across Europe. So a lot of momentum for Otezla despite a little bit of weakness in the first quarter. We also affirmed our guidance for the year for Otezla $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, so year-on-year great performance and a lot of momentum for the brand. Importantly, what we've been able to do over the last three or four year years is build out our inflammatory franchise to include what we believe is arguably one of the best portfolios in the world for inflammatory bowel diseases. So beginning with GED-301 or oligonucleotide that is only absorbed in the colon, and we've had some Phase II data for the product that's in Phase III now for Crohn's Disease. We think that’s an enormous opportunity and we'll wait to see what the data say and then we have high hopes for it commercially. About 22 months ago, we acquired Receptos for $7.2 billion net of cash to bring ozanimod into our portfolio. And two Mondays ago, we announced the second of two Phase III trials that were very positive for the drug in the setting of relapsed multiple sclerosis. So we're quite excited about that. We're anxious for investors and the community at large to see the data. We would submit the data to an academic meeting that will likely happen in the October timeframe. We're targeting certain meetings, but you never know exactly which meeting will pick up the abstract. We hope it’s extreme to speak at MS meeting in Europe that happens in late October. We're very, very excited about the data. And in fact the results of the two Phase III trials separately and together for relapsing MS put the product at a profile that is better than the base case we had when we did the deal to acquire the asset. The other thing that's happened with ozanimod is that we have proof of concept data, Phase II proof of concept data that we just got for Crohn's disease. So we have another disease category for ozanimod that will go Phase III at the end of the year. And that's on the back of ulcerative colitis where if we think about the deal model that's really where we put a lot of the value for this unique molecular entity ozanimod. So when I think about those molecules and the inflammatory bowel disease opportunity, when we model it, we easily see an opportunity to replace and offset a lot of what would be loss of revenue from the patent cliff into the next decade from lenalidomide to pomalidomide and then ABRAXANE. So we have a nice virtuous cycle of our portfolio playing out. Our second quarter momentum is quite good. So our first quarter, you might remember, we performed quite nicely year-on-year top line grew 18%, bottom line grew 27%. We see that momentum continuing very nicely in the second quarter. So our full year outlook feels very, very good. We have ASCO this weekend, which is the major cancer conference. We've got some data that will be presented there that reinforces the value proposition of our products in hematology and somewhat in oncology. We're excited about that. And I think this year is going to turn out to be one of the best years. We have a significant number of catalysts, I mentioned ozanimod in MS, but this year, we've accrued multiple Phase III trials and have read-outs of another series of Phase III trials. For example, with ABRAXANE, we have an early stage pancreatic cancer trial that is curative intent. These are patients who have a resection of their localized tumor. When they recover, they go to chemotherapy or no treatment. So it's intensive cure. We should see the result of that trial towards the end of the year and that would add substantially to our opportunity for ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer, and on and on and on. In our pipeline, we now have 14 molecules that we believe have the opportunity to be approved before 2021. Of those 14, nine to 10 of them are $1 billion products. Of the nine to 10, four of them have multi-billion dollar potential. And these are risk adjusted bottom up use of what the products can be. Overall, in our research portfolio, we have 50 programs, 50 molecules, these supported by 100 different clinical programs. Through the very virtuous environment we've reaffirmed our outlook for 2020 multiple times. We see ourselves growing from a top-line this year of between $13 billion and $13.4 billion to over $21 billion by 2020, and the bottom line growing from this range of $7.15 to $7.30 this year to more than $13 a share in 2020; so a lot of momentum; a lot of catalysts are intact; a lot of optionality is been built into the portfolio; and this is all on a business model with an operating margin that averages right around 55%. So thank you for being here today. I look forward to talking about Celgene, the industry, anything that's on your mind. So Ronnie thank you for the chance to intro Celgene and we can get started. Question-and-Answer Session Q - Ronny Gal Sure. So I noticed that our first conversation going back to the Washington back, you seem to have a pretty clear idea of how you think the market will change, maybe not the final answer, the couple of steps from the long way. Can you give us a feel for what do you feel particularly strong about how things will change? Mark Alles So I feel very strongly that there is political knowledge and willpower to think about things like access and affordability not as a pricing issue by itself, where pharma companies are being singled out as the reason that access and affordability for especially those cancer medicines and other medicines that have a high development cost, a higher risk premium attached to them. I think there is a lot of knowledge that the end-to-end cost is something that the politicians the world around us, is beginning to understand, and wants to do things, for example, based contracting. That is indication specific outcome where we could take a molecule contract with payers and actually have for differentiated outcomes, differentiated reimbursements. So we think that's an important principle that's getting a lot of attention around the world. Those kinds of things are available, but they're not available yet in the U.S. And I think there is an awareness that they need to become more available. I think the payers are looking to do that as well. The PBMs insurers, they would love to engage in these relationships. But that's not available to us yet in the U.S. So I think that's one example. I think the other example that's very clear are these contracts that create an absolute problem in terms of access for patients where the co-pay can be 30% to 50% of the cost of a monthly prescription. Where for a medically necessary medicine, where it may be the only thing that will help a patient, they're paying more out of pocket for the monthly prescription than they would if they had a cardiac procedure that was inpatient in the hospital. And the distinction is that in the hospitalized setting, the patient is not exposed to the co-pay. But it's much more expensive and less cost effective in many sense than a medicine with the exposure that the patient is realizing is what everyone is focused on. We need to think about flat or some rational way to think about out of pocket expenses, co-pay coinsurance, whatever in the context of life saving medicine that keeps people out of the hospital, which are more cost effective than a surgical procedure or an in-patient procedure cost a lot more but no one sees the out of pocket expense. These are things that people are paying a lot of attention to and I think there's a lot of willpower politically to figure out better ways of sharing that burden and creating access and affordability across the spectrum. Ronny Gal I hear you. Let's say the first one for a second. So obviously the best example here is the anti-TNF market and the ability to price for volume across multiple disease area. But it eventually blocks you if you have a great molecule for one of the condition. There are two outcomes to what you say system that gets implemented first. You have a split down the middle in innovative industry what so called innovative industry, where companies work to establish franchises that run for very long time? I'm going to take opposite position to companies that have novel molecules. And the second one is that you have to have some government regulation of commercial agreement, which seems very difficult with a Republican administration. So help me understand how we get there. You're talking about system where you’re trying to do a system reform when half of your industry is going to object to this. And to some extent, there's no easy path to implement. So can you guys give me a couple of steps in the middle how we get there? Mark Alles I think what we're talking about at macro level is a regulatory reform picture. So what are we able to do from a regulatory point of view? That is instead of pricing a medicine by SKU or presentation of the product; you look at that medicine and in the context of looking at outcome for disease X versus disease Y; pricing would be improved or not, reimbursement would be improved or not; based on the therapeutic outcome compared to a number of considerations; a regulatory environment that would be encouraging that is something that I think is very doable. And it's hard to argue against the regulatory environment that supports better reimbursement for better outcomes. Ronny Gal So you almost, you almost stating that you would be -- you said you'll be in favor of an organization that will actually evaluate the benefits of the drug based on some sort of economical value. In general the drug industry pulls that like… Mark Alles No, in a simple way, in a simplistic way, that happens every day all the time. It’s just creating a regulatory framework where it's totally appropriate for multiple parties to decide what that outcome looks like in a free market environment. We're talking about the U.S. So creating that opportunity is really simply looking at regulation in a slightly different way. And I don't think there's opposition to that. I think that most people would say, for example, a generic drug that's pennies on the dollar, and by the way 80% of the prescriptions in the United States are for generic, 90% are for generic drugs, so system does that already. This would be in the context of, for example, looking at reimbursement at some level, private and/or governmental reimbursement, and having an ability to say a drug that does exit one disease using some framework for objective evaluation of that outcome that you could actually charge more or get reimbursed more for those outcomes versus if you have incremental benefit and for a tiny fraction, you might have some benefit or you don't get used at all. So this would also help research and development, because the fact is lifecycle management and looking at the cost of developing drugs, if you know that they're differentiated reimbursement schemes for differentiated outcomes that would direct a lot of R&D in a different way. Ronny Gal I can really see the benefit, the development of pomalidomide, it sounds like a very difficult idea to implement in practice unless you have an ability to like eye for saying this drug is evaluated for X in this indication and this drug is evaluated for Y in this indication? Mark Alles So you say eye serve, but it could be any framework. And that's what I mean by regulatory before. When we develop molecules and submit dockets through the confident regulatory authorities around the world, there is a framework for how a drug and safety is reviewed. So having a reimbursement framework in a private public market situation that allows for free market development of products, pricing that would be in a free market setting, but then based on cost effectiveness or outcomes differentiated reimbursement, that's something that’s very doable, very, very doable. You just need the regulatory framework for that to happen. I'm not saying it’s simple and I'm not saying we’re ready for it but I think value based contracting and value based pricing is a way to deal with the economics that we've been struggling with. Let's take the cancer market and everyone in the room can identify with the cancer market. The cost of cancer therapy is not the issue. It's the cost of failure. So let's take the current excitement about the immunotherapy class of drugs, PD-1, PDL-1. If we take the totality of the results of all the studies that have happened, and some have been remarkable, checkpoint inhibitors will replace chemotherapy, it's really incredible. But when you look at the totality, less than half of the patients who are getting checkpoint inhibitors today by data are achieving meaningful clinical durable benefit. I think people can argue, but wouldn't argue too much against that. But we're still treating 100 patients to find the 50 who might do really well. There was a great outcome at FDA last week where FDA with Merck approved a broad-based indication for Keytruda that was based on the biomarker as opposed to the tissue of origin for the cancer. I think that's a great outcome -- it's a way to think about future in terms of biomarkers across a disease category as opposed to tumor-by-tumor. So I think that was wonderful. But the cost of failure is what is so problematic. That's why we're excited about, for example, in our own portfolio, a drug from our partner Agios, we call it, Idifa, AG-221 was the old name -- IDH2 drug, and it's for a subset of acute myeloid leukemia, one of the most lethal cancers known to man. Patients with this mutation have recently been identified as subjects for therapeutic intervention and that's the drug now Idifa. It's going to be approved with the companion diagnostics. So you can imagine that the opportunity for us to price it in a value orientation where we partner with payers, we partner with diagnostic and we put it in a market where only those patients who truly can benefit should get it, and we commercialize it only that way. It takes the cost effectiveness equation turns it on a tad and makes it totally cost effective. Compared with for example, today, how IDH2 mutated AML patients are treated in a group of patients with either first or second line AML. And this goes on multiples of times in the cancer market across every disease category. The cost of failure is what we can afford. So figuring out a regulatory framework where more homogeneity, more contracting for outcome is endorsed and allowed, is something that there is a lot of willpower for it. I'm not saying again it's going to happen tomorrow, but that's a wave I think that's coming. And by the way around the world, there are lots of examples of it in other market. So I think it's just a question of when not if. Ronny Gal It's just a time regulatory approval to value assessment, and then I think it's going to similar to other countries around the world. Most drug companies will find really, really challenging. This is still a best market… Mark Alles I am not talking about the free market environment where the Company has the ability to price in a free market environment. What I'm saying is if you're able to engage whether it's Medicare or take or payer and engage in a negotiation about the value of the medicine and then reimbursement of whatever price you want to set that environment is coming in some way that's here today. Ronny Gal Well we can discuss this longer to different setting. But I hear you about the direction at which this market will go. Let's talk a little bit about where Celgene is going. So one of the things you started was this discussion of we will go through the REVLIMID and also exclusivity between 23 and 25. And you've got a great drug in REVLIMID, hugely successful, helps a lot of patients. But no company has ever grown through that size of a patent loss. Now you guys -- you actually have a decade to think about it. And it seems one element of the strategy is we're going to use our catalyst to buy anything that looks really promising in areas where we have competencies. It seems like the other elements of the strategy should be -- and we will also buyback a lot of shares, and we will keep our options open to do something with REVLIMID to separate it from the rest of the business, somewhere towards the end of the life, so you can see the value of the core business. Can you help us understand a little bit about the other element of the strategy, should we expect them? And if so when you're going to be able to discuss? Mark Alles So I came this afternoon to announce our entire M&A -- you're exactly right that we are in a window where REVLIMID represents a lot of the success for the Company; it's concentrated revenue; it has a tremendous margin; it throws off a lot of free cash flow; and we're using that opportunity to lifecycle and build the Company. In fact, it's how it would seem to be; it's how we did the Ozanimod deal with Receptos; it's how in part we were able to acquire ABRAXANE. And then when you look at our partnership network, a lot of our reach into the world of partnership comes from this wonderful hematology franchise that we’ve built. We have patent hill not a patent cliff. So when you think about our future, you’re right to say that we have a 10 year window before we're fully exposed to a generic market for [multiple speakers] because we structure the arrangement, the settlement, such that in the beginning of 2022 -- now Teva, is limited to a mid-single digit volume of generic lenalidomide. And that grows out to 2025 to no more than 30% of the volume of lenalidomide in the market. And in 2026, we have the full generic entrance. So we do have a lot of time. We, as I said at the beginning, have already built the pipeline of line of sight to 14 molecules with different approval dates between now and 2021. If I just look at the inflammatory bowel disease franchise and I look at the three products Otezla, Ozanimod, GED-301, in a mix of puts and takes on thinking about success there, all of those molecules with the potential to launch before or around 2020 that revenue alone that opportunity alone can offset all of not the annual REVLIMID sales, but whatever the peak is this is a replacement for. And remember the hill, means I don't have to replace it all at once. This is the difference between how most people think about patent cliff and how this is structured right now from a settlement point of view. We have a window to incrementally increase our outlook while we decrease what we see coming from REVLIMID. And mathematically and from a modeling point of view with our pipeline, our current portfolio share buybacks and continuing to deploy capital aggressively to build the Company through partnerships and other M&A, we do believe we would be one of the first companies that could grow through a dominant products patent expiry. Again, it's a patent hill not a cliff. Ronny Gal So let's talk about -- so all this is going to -- this is all going to be de-risked become evident as we go through. You think about the 12 month, I think you mentioned one key milestone, and that would be ABRAXANE in non-small cell lung cancer. What are the other like key de-risking events, key milestone events, between now and the end of the year just make it easy? Mark Alles So we just had a major de-risking event, and let me just take a second on Ozanimod. It is unfortunate that on the one hand we were clear about the results of the two Phase III trials on the other hand, it was important to point out what is actually the fourth ranked secondary endpoint in the Phase III clinical trials, which is the disability index. That had a lot of investor interest and we understand why. With Gileniya assumed to go generic in '19, it was important to be clear on did we versus Gileniya have a statistically positive outcome on that endpoint. But it was the fourth secondary endpoint that also represents clinically and in the market how important or not that is in terms of the product profile. So we have dataset that we're very excited about and want to present as soon as we can that will come later in the year. As I said and I'll repeat now, we see the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE data presenting us with optionality in multiple sclerosis that in our base case, we saw as a risky event. We're sitting here today believing we have the therapeutic value from a molecule that allows us to consider and we will very likely build another franchise around neurosciences. So this is an anchor molecule that presents for us the opportunity to become a player in a number of dimensions of neurosciences. That's how sure we are about the molecule today. When we presented it academically, I hope you'll invite me back and we can talk about the totality of the dataset as opposed to a press release and the top-line data from the two Monday's ago. That is an enormous de-risking event. The other part of de-risking is the Phase II proof of concept data for Crohn’s. We now have another molecule that we can move into advanced phase development for Crohn’s disease, which is an enormous unmet medical need with multi multi-billion dollar potential for an active state drug. And then of course, we already know about ulcerative colitis, the maintenance figure were quite positive that's where we got comfortable that the cardiac profile was different than Gileniya, albeit it in a different disease state. So we add this up and we've had a massive de-risking event on the biggest M&A transaction we've had in the history of the Company that sets us. When I think about the core business, where we are executing on the REVLIMID maintenance launch, I think about where Otezla is in its current performance. So that the core business that we have, we've been able to do better quarter-after-after for multiple years in a row in a way that gives us the strength to continue on the business development side as we have. So we don't necessarily talk about the core business as a de-risking event, but it absolutely is. We had a tremendous Q1, Q2 halfway through looks fantastic, the year looks good. That means that as we think about 2020 and beyond, we’re stronger than what we thought our profile was in our existing business, that's a massive de-risking approach. For ABRAXANE, we talked about the pancreatic trials. We don't know the data. We talked about the I/O, we don't know the data. So we'll see what happens as a de-risking. But throughout the balance of the year, we're also fully accruing clinical trials. So let me give you two examples from a portfolio; yesterday, we finished accruing a trial of CC-46. Remember, we have a drug called VIDAZA internationally, that's still patented that generates $600 million a year and it's the only drug that is an alternative for high risk MDS and a subset of AML. So in the U.S., it's generic now but in Europe, it's still generating $100 million in revenue. We have an oral form of this drug CC-46. We completed the accrual of a very important study, called AML-001. These are patients who get into remission, which is rare for AML patients. And the randomization is placebo as the control arm versus 46% as experimental arm, it's a maintenance strategy. So we think REVLIMID maintenance after transplant that's what we're trying to do in AML. So that trial is now fully accrued. It would be a very novel strategy and CC-46 has the potential not only to be a maintenance drug in AML, but a drug for AML. And importantly, we have information that's been published we're at prime as in epigenetic drug, as a precursor to checkpoint inhibitors. So there is some synergy and a primary effect that may play out to help checkpoint inhibitors to work better. And we're testing that theory in diseases like ovarian cancer for patients who get platinum therapy, do not progress with measurable disease, they progresses with what’s called CA-125. And that biomarker driven approach is where we put CC-46 before they get a checkpoint inhibitor. So we're testing this drug in a number of very important immunologic conditions. And there’s luspatercept this is a drug from our partnership with Acceleron. We finished accruing for a low risk NDS population. This study we are very excited about, because this is not only proof of concept in patients who are transfusion dependent but it's also way to think about luspatercept more broadly in any setting where anemia is problematic, and where EPO may or may not be a therapeutic choice. So it is an NDS treatment today, but we have no idea where this mechanism could take us in the future. So that's a study that's fully accrued that puts luspatercept in that 14 molecules with multi-billion potential, so that's just a standpoint of de-risking and excitement. Ronny Gal So one of the things that's interesting. So CC-46 you mentioned you accrued the AML trial. Remind us that nothing ever worked in AML in maintenance setting in a significant way, and this is comparing to the NDS trial the same molecule that's probably the more the riskier program? Mark Alles So Ronny, let me appreciate your point and make sure we amplify it. Maintenance strategies for blood cancers have largely been ineffective. There are two scenarios where it's worked really well, REVLIMID maintenance post transplant in myeloma and RITUXAN in follicular lymphoma. So two scenarios -- but other scenarios that the problem with AML and nothing has ever worked is patients are so sick that they rapidly progress to death. So even if you get an incomplete remission, it's such a short live remission that nothing has been effective to hold that remission before they break through and die. We know that from Idifa, we know that from VIDAZA. So this is a strategy that is a risky strategy but since VIDAZA works well in AML, we thought it made sense to take mechanism of the drug and oral form and test it in the setting. So it would be risky, but we think it's worth the risk. Ronny Gal So one of the things that I kind of learn is I was looking at the Company is the value of those maintenance programs. So this is the multi-year use of the drugs for years and years is what's driving the expansion of the REVLIMID franchise. So I hear about luspatercept, but one of the questions of luspatercept is. Should I think about this as a drug, which is priced roughly versus the people franchise or the RNS franchise, or something that's priced against other oncology assets in the high end of innovation? Mark Alles So, we're not looking at pricing outside of a cancer treatment market. So we don't know yet what the pricing would be, but right now it's an intervention for low risk transfusion dependent MDS patient. The point I'm making is that once you have that outcome, anemia broadly becomes an interesting discussion. So I want to be careful that we're not thinking about this as some areas or EPO, but the mechanism and anemia broadly becomes an interesting discussion with a positive result in a low risk MDS market. Ronny Gal Make sense. The other question is kind of more broadly question for… Mark Alles Can I just -- one thing before we move on, I think the audience heard you talked about durability, maintenance and duration as a driver. I think this is very important point. So back to value back to outcomes where pricing maintenance therapy for different medicines the same as acute treatment today. You get my point? So medicine that's approved to maintain the benefit of other therapy, transplants this or that, the pricing today by regulatory structure has to be the same. Ronny Gal Good point. Why is that? Mark Alles Because that's the regulatory framework. We would absolutely be encouraged there’s an industry to look at alternative strategies for R&D about how to maintain the benefit or treat patients differently if the acute setting to control a disease, like cancer, was treated from a reimbursement perspective differently than maintaining the benefit of something else. So I wanted to use that example because we are in fact advantaged as a Company by the duration effect of the medicines that we have for cancer that control the disease extraordinarily long, and that's a big value driver for the Company. Ronny Gal So the question that comes here is that you're talking little bit about the double edged sword. So in one way, you're charging now somewhere between $130,000 and $160,000 for annual treatment with REVLIMID at the full dose on an ongoing basis. So the value here that you got a drug that worked for four-five-six if you had DARA seven-eight years potentially. And so the value per patient exceeds a million. Now if you allow the system to break away that compromise you just discussed, you might end up in a situation where those outer years, the value that you get per year of treatment, would drop dramatically versus getting the disease under control. Mark Alles So let's be clear what we're talking about. The economics of healthcare are not going to get better. Across the world and in the U.S., if you look at the discretionary spending economically, the proportion of discretionary spending that goes to healthcare is growing so rapidly, it's not drug pricing that's doing it. It's the totality of what we spend. Let's use some numbers, so that we're all together. The estimate this year is that healthcare spending in the U.S. direct is approaching $3.5 trillion. Some people think it might be as high as $4 trillion. Let's just pick $3.5 trillion, because off of last year, which was more $3 trillion, we're in the range. Obesity alone of that $3 trillion is about $300 billion to $400 billion of direct medical spend, just for the management of obesity, we spend more in the U.S. every year than the totality of all prescription drug spending, which is around $350 billion. There is no way to talk about an environment where the cost effective part, the solutions, the free market pricing we want to maintain could be maintained if we don't have new models for how to price medicines. So you can't have it both ways. You can't talk about duration versus the acute intervention on one hand to say I don't want that, because it might change the profile of my company; and at the same time say politicians should stay out of free market enterprise and the risk of developing a pharmaceutical, which is right about $2 billion; the launch price is the capture at least till a period of time all the investment that was made in developing the drug to that point; beyond that, pricing action have had different rationale based on the company, that's up to the company to defend enough for me or pharma to defend, but you can’t have it both ways. You’re either for value outcome or you're not. And we believe, I believe, that the future of healthcare and the cost effect is the only part that goes down in cost overtime, the pharmaceutical business compared to all other costs that we have to engage in value discussions about what our medicines do. I would much rather have a free market environment for the rest of the industry's life than to say well this might change in acute versus a maintenance environment, because the value that we get by being innovators and taking the risk is much greater in a free market environment, but that has considerations for different settings, it doesn't happened today. So we’re for that because the economics of this, mean that for us to contribute to solutions, we need the different way to think about pricing. I hope that's clear. Ronny Gal So I have got a series of questions about individual molecules we probably should hit. But in the meantime, let me remind folks who want to ask the card forward with question to do that now. So question about ABRAXANE, so we think that it's happened that you’ve gone that appears to be in that patent challenge I think against [indiscernible] again is October 27, 2024. Is this roughly we should think about ABRAXANE franchise facing generic entry, and just understand do we have a lifecycle management for that molecule beyond 2024? Mark Alles Thanks a lot for the question. It's really important because when you think about the molecule, this idea of using albumin as a preferred transporter of medicine is something that's Celgene hasn't spent a lot of been talking about. So Ronny thanks for the chance to mention it. It turns out that albumin is this ratio of paclitaxel, which are nanoparticles in the albumin suspension that we are working on a number of strategies where it turns out that platform is much more flexible than we might have thought. If you just think about how it comes out of the manufacturing process and the final steps and what can survive the embedded or suspended in an albumin nanoparticle. And we've done a lot of work that now gives us pretty big excitement about manufacturing that has a lot of flexibility about what we can insert and then create as a new molecule, so more to come on that. We're been a little bit of cautious because we're filing a lot of IP around it. But it turns out that tumors, solid tumors in particular, do through a mechanism called macropinocytosis actually don't do want to absorb more albumin than non-cancer tissues. So we're going to take advantage of that. And in a broader sense, we might have a sweet of opportunities off of that technology platform that actually make ABRAXANE a prototypical drug versus the only drug. And that could happen in the next decade. Ronny Gal So let's put it to -- so ABRAXANE 2024 is still… Mark Alles We still think about early 2020s as the cliff but we also think about it it's a difficult drug to make. This is not a classic generic. Let me give you example of VIDAZA, VIDAZA in the U.S. had lost exclusivity for two years before we had a generic threat. So we've already been down this road with tough manufacturing of injectable drugs. And it's not given that with expiry you have a lot of competition. Ronny Gal That's part of my thesis with Teva actually. But coming back to [multiple speakers] so the notions will be a second generation for paclitaxel specifically. I understand if you can potentially take this technology and broaden it, Mark Alles Probably not paclitaxel… Ronny Gal But other molecules… Mark Alles Yes, it would be other molecules and it's not hard to imagine what they could be. Remember, paclitaxel in its soluble form needs cremafor to be diluted. So you take almost any other cancer drug that is more soluble, it's pretty easy to imagine if we could perfect the manufacturing we can suspend it, distribute it and then deliver it through the albumin transporter. Ronny Gal Makes lot of sense… Unidentified Analyst So what was after that, durva… Mark Alles By the way, you're the first person that's asked anything about that so long, it’s like wow, a new question, thank you. Unidentified Analyst Durvalumab, PDL-1. When are we going to see the kind of in your mind the first proof-of-concept of that drug in combination with either CELMoDs or in general in combination… Mark Alles Yes, even REVLIMID. So we have high expectation that we'll have a number of ASH abstracts that would begin to show us some of the combinatorial response data and safety data. So end of the year at ASH, that's our current expectation. Ronny Gal You mentioned oral [cytarabine], so one of the opportunities here is really to expand the duration of treatment in not just patients who can no longer take epigen but across the portfolio -- across the disease category. If you kind of have to contract for us, what is it’s kind of possible that what is the contrast here between the patients who are EPO sensitive versus EPO no longer sensitive? And what is the opportunity in the patients that could otherwise take EPO for a new molecule? How do they compare based on quality of life. Mark Alles And so today, let me be sure that we're all on the same page, because there are a number of considerations about the patient profile. So first, in the context of whether we're talking about anemia that's transfusion dependent or independent, and that's coincidental to someone with MDS or leukemia. So these are contemporaneous issues. EPO is usually used before a patient or at the time a patient becomes transfusion dependent. So it's upstream. We're talking about downstream where patients have become transfusion dependent. At that point, if you can make them transfusion independent, the whole association with EPO is irrelevant, because they've been exposed to the ESAs before. And the casing point is the development of REVLIMID in low risk MDS. The approval for the deletion side Q subset was for patients who in fact almost exclusively had felt EPO, became transfusion dependent then they became transfusion independent on REVLIMID. We're using that same approach to whether it's low risk, intermediate risk, high risk MDS, or any setting in leukemia where unfortunately patients really don't become transfusion dependent, they need platelets, they need a lot of support. And so anemia is the least of their problems, because they're blowing through their blast count to unfortunately an early death. These are very sick patients. So anemia you support them, it's not about whether you use ESA or it's not about whether you intervene and shutdown the blast count, that's what we're focused on. Ronny Gal Anyone in the audience would like to ask the last question? And with that I guess, Mark, we really appreciate your time. Thanks very much. Mark Alles Thank you. Thanks everybody.

So I noticed that our first conversation going back to the Washington back, you seem to have a pretty clear idea of how you think the market will change, maybe not the final answer, the couple of steps from the long way. Can you give us a feel for what do you feel particularly strong about how things will change? Mark Alles So I feel very strongly that there is political knowledge and willpower to think about things like access and affordability not as a pricing issue by itself, where pharma companies are being singled out as the reason that access and affordability for especially those cancer medicines and other medicines that have a high development cost, a higher risk premium attached to them. I think there is a lot of knowledge that the end-to-end cost is something that the politicians the world around us, is beginning to understand, and wants to do things, for example, based contracting. That is indication specific outcome where we could take a molecule contract with payers and actually have for differentiated outcomes, differentiated reimbursements. So we think that's an important principle that's getting a lot of attention around the world. Those kinds of things are available, but they're not available yet in the U.S. And I think there is an awareness that they need to become more available. I think the payers are looking to do that as well. The PBMs insurers, they would love to engage in these relationships. But that's not available to us yet in the U.S. So I think that's one example. I think the other example that's very clear are these contracts that create an absolute problem in terms of access for patients where the co-pay can be 30% to 50% of the cost of a monthly prescription. Where for a medically necessary medicine, where it may be the only thing that will help a patient, they're paying more out of pocket for the monthly prescription than they would if they had a cardiac procedure that was inpatient in the hospital. And the distinction is that in the hospitalized setting, the patient is not exposed to the co-pay. But it's much more expensive and less cost effective in many sense than a medicine with the exposure that the patient is realizing is what everyone is focused on. We need to think about flat or some rational way to think about out of pocket expenses, co-pay coinsurance, whatever in the context of life saving medicine that keeps people out of the hospital, which are more cost effective than a surgical procedure or an in-patient procedure cost a lot more but no one sees the out of pocket expense. These are things that people are paying a lot of attention to and I think there's a lot of willpower politically to figure out better ways of sharing that burden and creating access and affordability across the spectrum. Ronny Gal I hear you. Let's say the first one for a second. So obviously the best example here is the anti-TNF market and the ability to price for volume across multiple disease area. But it eventually blocks you if you have a great molecule for one of the condition. There are two outcomes to what you say system that gets implemented first. You have a split down the middle in innovative industry what so called innovative industry, where companies work to establish franchises that run for very long time? I'm going to take opposite position to companies that have novel molecules. And the second one is that you have to have some government regulation of commercial agreement, which seems very difficult with a Republican administration. So help me understand how we get there. You're talking about system where you’re trying to do a system reform when half of your industry is going to object to this. And to some extent, there's no easy path to implement. So can you guys give me a couple of steps in the middle how we get there? Mark Alles I think what we're talking about at macro level is a regulatory reform picture. So what are we able to do from a regulatory point of view? That is instead of pricing a medicine by SKU or presentation of the product; you look at that medicine and in the context of looking at outcome for disease X versus disease Y; pricing would be improved or not, reimbursement would be improved or not; based on the therapeutic outcome compared to a number of considerations; a regulatory environment that would be encouraging that is something that I think is very doable. And it's hard to argue against the regulatory environment that supports better reimbursement for better outcomes. Ronny Gal So you almost, you almost stating that you would be -- you said you'll be in favor of an organization that will actually evaluate the benefits of the drug based on some sort of economical value. In general the drug industry pulls that like… Mark Alles No, in a simple way, in a simplistic way, that happens every day all the time. It’s just creating a regulatory framework where it's totally appropriate for multiple parties to decide what that outcome looks like in a free market environment. We're talking about the U.S. So creating that opportunity is really simply looking at regulation in a slightly different way. And I don't think there's opposition to that. I think that most people would say, for example, a generic drug that's pennies on the dollar, and by the way 80% of the prescriptions in the United States are for generic, 90% are for generic drugs, so system does that already. This would be in the context of, for example, looking at reimbursement at some level, private and/or governmental reimbursement, and having an ability to say a drug that does exit one disease using some framework for objective evaluation of that outcome that you could actually charge more or get reimbursed more for those outcomes versus if you have incremental benefit and for a tiny fraction, you might have some benefit or you don't get used at all. So this would also help research and development, because the fact is lifecycle management and looking at the cost of developing drugs, if you know that they're differentiated reimbursement schemes for differentiated outcomes that would direct a lot of R&D in a different way. Ronny Gal I can really see the benefit, the development of pomalidomide, it sounds like a very difficult idea to implement in practice unless you have an ability to like eye for saying this drug is evaluated for X in this indication and this drug is evaluated for Y in this indication? Mark Alles So you say eye serve, but it could be any framework. And that's what I mean by regulatory before. When we develop molecules and submit dockets through the confident regulatory authorities around the world, there is a framework for how a drug and safety is reviewed. So having a reimbursement framework in a private public market situation that allows for free market development of products, pricing that would be in a free market setting, but then based on cost effectiveness or outcomes differentiated reimbursement, that's something that’s very doable, very, very doable. You just need the regulatory framework for that to happen. I'm not saying it’s simple and I'm not saying we’re ready for it but I think value based contracting and value based pricing is a way to deal with the economics that we've been struggling with. Let's take the cancer market and everyone in the room can identify with the cancer market. The cost of cancer therapy is not the issue. It's the cost of failure. So let's take the current excitement about the immunotherapy class of drugs, PD-1, PDL-1. If we take the totality of the results of all the studies that have happened, and some have been remarkable, checkpoint inhibitors will replace chemotherapy, it's really incredible. But when you look at the totality, less than half of the patients who are getting checkpoint inhibitors today by data are achieving meaningful clinical durable benefit. I think people can argue, but wouldn't argue too much against that. But we're still treating 100 patients to find the 50 who might do really well. There was a great outcome at FDA last week where FDA with Merck approved a broad-based indication for Keytruda that was based on the biomarker as opposed to the tissue of origin for the cancer. I think that's a great outcome -- it's a way to think about future in terms of biomarkers across a disease category as opposed to tumor-by-tumor. So I think that was wonderful. But the cost of failure is what is so problematic. That's why we're excited about, for example, in our own portfolio, a drug from our partner Agios, we call it, Idifa, AG-221 was the old name -- IDH2 drug, and it's for a subset of acute myeloid leukemia, one of the most lethal cancers known to man. Patients with this mutation have recently been identified as subjects for therapeutic intervention and that's the drug now Idifa. It's going to be approved with the companion diagnostics. So you can imagine that the opportunity for us to price it in a value orientation where we partner with payers, we partner with diagnostic and we put it in a market where only those patients who truly can benefit should get it, and we commercialize it only that way. It takes the cost effectiveness equation turns it on a tad and makes it totally cost effective. Compared with for example, today, how IDH2 mutated AML patients are treated in a group of patients with either first or second line AML. And this goes on multiples of times in the cancer market across every disease category. The cost of failure is what we can afford. So figuring out a regulatory framework where more homogeneity, more contracting for outcome is endorsed and allowed, is something that there is a lot of willpower for it. I'm not saying again it's going to happen tomorrow, but that's a wave I think that's coming. And by the way around the world, there are lots of examples of it in other market. So I think it's just a question of when not if. Ronny Gal It's just a time regulatory approval to value assessment, and then I think it's going to similar to other countries around the world. Most drug companies will find really, really challenging. This is still a best market… Mark Alles I am not talking about the free market environment where the Company has the ability to price in a free market environment. What I'm saying is if you're able to engage whether it's Medicare or take or payer and engage in a negotiation about the value of the medicine and then reimbursement of whatever price you want to set that environment is coming in some way that's here today. Ronny Gal Well we can discuss this longer to different setting. But I hear you about the direction at which this market will go. Let's talk a little bit about where Celgene is going. So one of the things you started was this discussion of we will go through the REVLIMID and also exclusivity between 23 and 25. And you've got a great drug in REVLIMID, hugely successful, helps a lot of patients. But no company has ever grown through that size of a patent loss. Now you guys -- you actually have a decade to think about it. And it seems one element of the strategy is we're going to use our catalyst to buy anything that looks really promising in areas where we have competencies. It seems like the other elements of the strategy should be -- and we will also buyback a lot of shares, and we will keep our options open to do something with REVLIMID to separate it from the rest of the business, somewhere towards the end of the life, so you can see the value of the core business. Can you help us understand a little bit about the other element of the strategy, should we expect them? And if so when you're going to be able to discuss? Mark Alles So I came this afternoon to announce our entire M&A -- you're exactly right that we are in a window where REVLIMID represents a lot of the success for the Company; it's concentrated revenue; it has a tremendous margin; it throws off a lot of free cash flow; and we're using that opportunity to lifecycle and build the Company. In fact, it's how it would seem to be; it's how we did the Ozanimod deal with Receptos; it's how in part we were able to acquire ABRAXANE. And then when you look at our partnership network, a lot of our reach into the world of partnership comes from this wonderful hematology franchise that we’ve built. We have patent hill not a patent cliff. So when you think about our future, you’re right to say that we have a 10 year window before we're fully exposed to a generic market for [multiple speakers] because we structure the arrangement, the settlement, such that in the beginning of 2022 -- now Teva, is limited to a mid-single digit volume of generic lenalidomide. And that grows out to 2025 to no more than 30% of the volume of lenalidomide in the market. And in 2026, we have the full generic entrance. So we do have a lot of time. We, as I said at the beginning, have already built the pipeline of line of sight to 14 molecules with different approval dates between now and 2021. If I just look at the inflammatory bowel disease franchise and I look at the three products Otezla, Ozanimod, GED-301, in a mix of puts and takes on thinking about success there, all of those molecules with the potential to launch before or around 2020 that revenue alone that opportunity alone can offset all of not the annual REVLIMID sales, but whatever the peak is this is a replacement for. And remember the hill, means I don't have to replace it all at once. This is the difference between how most people think about patent cliff and how this is structured right now from a settlement point of view. We have a window to incrementally increase our outlook while we decrease what we see coming from REVLIMID. And mathematically and from a modeling point of view with our pipeline, our current portfolio share buybacks and continuing to deploy capital aggressively to build the Company through partnerships and other M&A, we do believe we would be one of the first companies that could grow through a dominant products patent expiry. Again, it's a patent hill not a cliff. Ronny Gal So let's talk about -- so all this is going to -- this is all going to be de-risked become evident as we go through. You think about the 12 month, I think you mentioned one key milestone, and that would be ABRAXANE in non-small cell lung cancer. What are the other like key de-risking events, key milestone events, between now and the end of the year just make it easy? Mark Alles So we just had a major de-risking event, and let me just take a second on Ozanimod. It is unfortunate that on the one hand we were clear about the results of the two Phase III trials on the other hand, it was important to point out what is actually the fourth ranked secondary endpoint in the Phase III clinical trials, which is the disability index. That had a lot of investor interest and we understand why. With Gileniya assumed to go generic in '19, it was important to be clear on did we versus Gileniya have a statistically positive outcome on that endpoint. But it was the fourth secondary endpoint that also represents clinically and in the market how important or not that is in terms of the product profile. So we have dataset that we're very excited about and want to present as soon as we can that will come later in the year. As I said and I'll repeat now, we see the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE data presenting us with optionality in multiple sclerosis that in our base case, we saw as a risky event. We're sitting here today believing we have the therapeutic value from a molecule that allows us to consider and we will very likely build another franchise around neurosciences. So this is an anchor molecule that presents for us the opportunity to become a player in a number of dimensions of neurosciences. That's how sure we are about the molecule today. When we presented it academically, I hope you'll invite me back and we can talk about the totality of the dataset as opposed to a press release and the top-line data from the two Monday's ago. That is an enormous de-risking event. The other part of de-risking is the Phase II proof of concept data for Crohn’s. We now have another molecule that we can move into advanced phase development for Crohn’s disease, which is an enormous unmet medical need with multi multi-billion dollar potential for an active state drug. And then of course, we already know about ulcerative colitis, the maintenance figure were quite positive that's where we got comfortable that the cardiac profile was different than Gileniya, albeit it in a different disease state. So we add this up and we've had a massive de-risking event on the biggest M&A transaction we've had in the history of the Company that sets us. When I think about the core business, where we are executing on the REVLIMID maintenance launch, I think about where Otezla is in its current performance. So that the core business that we have, we've been able to do better quarter-after-after for multiple years in a row in a way that gives us the strength to continue on the business development side as we have. So we don't necessarily talk about the core business as a de-risking event, but it absolutely is. We had a tremendous Q1, Q2 halfway through looks fantastic, the year looks good. That means that as we think about 2020 and beyond, we’re stronger than what we thought our profile was in our existing business, that's a massive de-risking approach. For ABRAXANE, we talked about the pancreatic trials. We don't know the data. We talked about the I/O, we don't know the data. So we'll see what happens as a de-risking. But throughout the balance of the year, we're also fully accruing clinical trials. So let me give you two examples from a portfolio; yesterday, we finished accruing a trial of CC-46. Remember, we have a drug called VIDAZA internationally, that's still patented that generates $600 million a year and it's the only drug that is an alternative for high risk MDS and a subset of AML. So in the U.S., it's generic now but in Europe, it's still generating $100 million in revenue. We have an oral form of this drug CC-46. We completed the accrual of a very important study, called AML-001. These are patients who get into remission, which is rare for AML patients. And the randomization is placebo as the control arm versus 46% as experimental arm, it's a maintenance strategy. So we think REVLIMID maintenance after transplant that's what we're trying to do in AML. So that trial is now fully accrued. It would be a very novel strategy and CC-46 has the potential not only to be a maintenance drug in AML, but a drug for AML. And importantly, we have information that's been published we're at prime as in epigenetic drug, as a precursor to checkpoint inhibitors. So there is some synergy and a primary effect that may play out to help checkpoint inhibitors to work better. And we're testing that theory in diseases like ovarian cancer for patients who get platinum therapy, do not progress with measurable disease, they progresses with what’s called CA-125. And that biomarker driven approach is where we put CC-46 before they get a checkpoint inhibitor. So we're testing this drug in a number of very important immunologic conditions. And there’s luspatercept this is a drug from our partnership with Acceleron. We finished accruing for a low risk NDS population. This study we are very excited about, because this is not only proof of concept in patients who are transfusion dependent but it's also way to think about luspatercept more broadly in any setting where anemia is problematic, and where EPO may or may not be a therapeutic choice. So it is an NDS treatment today, but we have no idea where this mechanism could take us in the future. So that's a study that's fully accrued that puts luspatercept in that 14 molecules with multi-billion potential, so that's just a standpoint of de-risking and excitement. Ronny Gal So one of the things that's interesting. So CC-46 you mentioned you accrued the AML trial. Remind us that nothing ever worked in AML in maintenance setting in a significant way, and this is comparing to the NDS trial the same molecule that's probably the more the riskier program? Mark Alles So Ronny, let me appreciate your point and make sure we amplify it. Maintenance strategies for blood cancers have largely been ineffective. There are two scenarios where it's worked really well, REVLIMID maintenance post transplant in myeloma and RITUXAN in follicular lymphoma. So two scenarios -- but other scenarios that the problem with AML and nothing has ever worked is patients are so sick that they rapidly progress to death. So even if you get an incomplete remission, it's such a short live remission that nothing has been effective to hold that remission before they break through and die. We know that from Idifa, we know that from VIDAZA. So this is a strategy that is a risky strategy but since VIDAZA works well in AML, we thought it made sense to take mechanism of the drug and oral form and test it in the setting. So it would be risky, but we think it's worth the risk. Ronny Gal So one of the things that I kind of learn is I was looking at the Company is the value of those maintenance programs. So this is the multi-year use of the drugs for years and years is what's driving the expansion of the REVLIMID franchise. So I hear about luspatercept, but one of the questions of luspatercept is. Should I think about this as a drug, which is priced roughly versus the people franchise or the RNS franchise, or something that's priced against other oncology assets in the high end of innovation? Mark Alles So, we're not looking at pricing outside of a cancer treatment market. So we don't know yet what the pricing would be, but right now it's an intervention for low risk transfusion dependent MDS patient. The point I'm making is that once you have that outcome, anemia broadly becomes an interesting discussion. So I want to be careful that we're not thinking about this as some areas or EPO, but the mechanism and anemia broadly becomes an interesting discussion with a positive result in a low risk MDS market. Ronny Gal Make sense. The other question is kind of more broadly question for… Mark Alles Can I just -- one thing before we move on, I think the audience heard you talked about durability, maintenance and duration as a driver. I think this is very important point. So back to value back to outcomes where pricing maintenance therapy for different medicines the same as acute treatment today. You get my point? So medicine that's approved to maintain the benefit of other therapy, transplants this or that, the pricing today by regulatory structure has to be the same. Ronny Gal Good point. Why is that? Mark Alles Because that's the regulatory framework. We would absolutely be encouraged there’s an industry to look at alternative strategies for R&D about how to maintain the benefit or treat patients differently if the acute setting to control a disease, like cancer, was treated from a reimbursement perspective differently than maintaining the benefit of something else. So I wanted to use that example because we are in fact advantaged as a Company by the duration effect of the medicines that we have for cancer that control the disease extraordinarily long, and that's a big value driver for the Company. Ronny Gal So the question that comes here is that you're talking little bit about the double edged sword. So in one way, you're charging now somewhere between $130,000 and $160,000 for annual treatment with REVLIMID at the full dose on an ongoing basis. So the value here that you got a drug that worked for four-five-six if you had DARA seven-eight years potentially. And so the value per patient exceeds a million. Now if you allow the system to break away that compromise you just discussed, you might end up in a situation where those outer years, the value that you get per year of treatment, would drop dramatically versus getting the disease under control. Mark Alles So let's be clear what we're talking about. The economics of healthcare are not going to get better. Across the world and in the U.S., if you look at the discretionary spending economically, the proportion of discretionary spending that goes to healthcare is growing so rapidly, it's not drug pricing that's doing it. It's the totality of what we spend. Let's use some numbers, so that we're all together. The estimate this year is that healthcare spending in the U.S. direct is approaching $3.5 trillion. Some people think it might be as high as $4 trillion. Let's just pick $3.5 trillion, because off of last year, which was more $3 trillion, we're in the range. Obesity alone of that $3 trillion is about $300 billion to $400 billion of direct medical spend, just for the management of obesity, we spend more in the U.S. every year than the totality of all prescription drug spending, which is around $350 billion. There is no way to talk about an environment where the cost effective part, the solutions, the free market pricing we want to maintain could be maintained if we don't have new models for how to price medicines. So you can't have it both ways. You can't talk about duration versus the acute intervention on one hand to say I don't want that, because it might change the profile of my company; and at the same time say politicians should stay out of free market enterprise and the risk of developing a pharmaceutical, which is right about $2 billion; the launch price is the capture at least till a period of time all the investment that was made in developing the drug to that point; beyond that, pricing action have had different rationale based on the company, that's up to the company to defend enough for me or pharma to defend, but you can’t have it both ways. You’re either for value outcome or you're not. And we believe, I believe, that the future of healthcare and the cost effect is the only part that goes down in cost overtime, the pharmaceutical business compared to all other costs that we have to engage in value discussions about what our medicines do. I would much rather have a free market environment for the rest of the industry's life than to say well this might change in acute versus a maintenance environment, because the value that we get by being innovators and taking the risk is much greater in a free market environment, but that has considerations for different settings, it doesn't happened today. So we’re for that because the economics of this, mean that for us to contribute to solutions, we need the different way to think about pricing. I hope that's clear. Ronny Gal So I have got a series of questions about individual molecules we probably should hit. But in the meantime, let me remind folks who want to ask the card forward with question to do that now. So question about ABRAXANE, so we think that it's happened that you’ve gone that appears to be in that patent challenge I think against [indiscernible] again is October 27, 2024. Is this roughly we should think about ABRAXANE franchise facing generic entry, and just understand do we have a lifecycle management for that molecule beyond 2024? Mark Alles Thanks a lot for the question. It's really important because when you think about the molecule, this idea of using albumin as a preferred transporter of medicine is something that's Celgene hasn't spent a lot of been talking about. So Ronny thanks for the chance to mention it. It turns out that albumin is this ratio of paclitaxel, which are nanoparticles in the albumin suspension that we are working on a number of strategies where it turns out that platform is much more flexible than we might have thought. If you just think about how it comes out of the manufacturing process and the final steps and what can survive the embedded or suspended in an albumin nanoparticle. And we've done a lot of work that now gives us pretty big excitement about manufacturing that has a lot of flexibility about what we can insert and then create as a new molecule, so more to come on that. We're been a little bit of cautious because we're filing a lot of IP around it. But it turns out that tumors, solid tumors in particular, do through a mechanism called macropinocytosis actually don't do want to absorb more albumin than non-cancer tissues. So we're going to take advantage of that. And in a broader sense, we might have a sweet of opportunities off of that technology platform that actually make ABRAXANE a prototypical drug versus the only drug. And that could happen in the next decade. Ronny Gal So let's put it to -- so ABRAXANE 2024 is still… Mark Alles We still think about early 2020s as the cliff but we also think about it it's a difficult drug to make. This is not a classic generic. Let me give you example of VIDAZA, VIDAZA in the U.S. had lost exclusivity for two years before we had a generic threat. So we've already been down this road with tough manufacturing of injectable drugs. And it's not given that with expiry you have a lot of competition. Ronny Gal That's part of my thesis with Teva actually. But coming back to [multiple speakers] so the notions will be a second generation for paclitaxel specifically. I understand if you can potentially take this technology and broaden it, Mark Alles Probably not paclitaxel… Ronny Gal But other molecules… Mark Alles Yes, it would be other molecules and it's not hard to imagine what they could be. Remember, paclitaxel in its soluble form needs cremafor to be diluted. So you take almost any other cancer drug that is more soluble, it's pretty easy to imagine if we could perfect the manufacturing we can suspend it, distribute it and then deliver it through the albumin transporter. Ronny Gal Makes lot of sense… Unidentified Analyst So what was after that, durva… Mark Alles By the way, you're the first person that's asked anything about that so long, it’s like wow, a new question, thank you. Unidentified Analyst Durvalumab, PDL-1. When are we going to see the kind of in your mind the first proof-of-concept of that drug in combination with either CELMoDs or in general in combination… Mark Alles Yes, even REVLIMID. So we have high expectation that we'll have a number of ASH abstracts that would begin to show us some of the combinatorial response data and safety data. So end of the year at ASH, that's our current expectation. Ronny Gal You mentioned oral [cytarabine], so one of the opportunities here is really to expand the duration of treatment in not just patients who can no longer take epigen but across the portfolio -- across the disease category. If you kind of have to contract for us, what is it’s kind of possible that what is the contrast here between the patients who are EPO sensitive versus EPO no longer sensitive? And what is the opportunity in the patients that could otherwise take EPO for a new molecule? How do they compare based on quality of life. Mark Alles And so today, let me be sure that we're all on the same page, because there are a number of considerations about the patient profile. So first, in the context of whether we're talking about anemia that's transfusion dependent or independent, and that's coincidental to someone with MDS or leukemia. So these are contemporaneous issues. EPO is usually used before a patient or at the time a patient becomes transfusion dependent. So it's upstream. We're talking about downstream where patients have become transfusion dependent. At that point, if you can make them transfusion independent, the whole association with EPO is irrelevant, because they've been exposed to the ESAs before. And the casing point is the development of REVLIMID in low risk MDS. The approval for the deletion side Q subset was for patients who in fact almost exclusively had felt EPO, became transfusion dependent then they became transfusion independent on REVLIMID. We're using that same approach to whether it's low risk, intermediate risk, high risk MDS, or any setting in leukemia where unfortunately patients really don't become transfusion dependent, they need platelets, they need a lot of support. And so anemia is the least of their problems, because they're blowing through their blast count to unfortunately an early death. These are very sick patients. So anemia you support them, it's not about whether you use ESA or it's not about whether you intervene and shutdown the blast count, that's what we're focused on. Ronny Gal Anyone in the audience would like to ask the last question? And with that I guess, Mark, we really appreciate your time. Thanks very much. Mark Alles Thank you. Thanks everybody.

Also joining us today are Gerry Pappert, General Counsel; Bob Repella, Senior Vice President and Head of our U.S. Pharmaceutical Business; and dialing in from Australia, Dr. Lesley Russell, Chief Medical Officer. Following remarks by Kevin and Wilco, we will be pleased to answer your questions.  Now, Kevin Buchi. J. Buchi Thanks, Chip, good afternoon, everyone. Division and strategy that we created under Frank Baldino\'s leadership remains an integral part of our company. It was a privilege to have worked with Frank and I\'m honored to lead this great company into the future. We will continue to focus on new therapeutic areas that offer unique patient benefits. While there is risk inherent in the development of these new compounds, we have mitigated this by creating a portfolio of opportunities.  Creating significant shareholder value requires bringing products to market that offer unique benefits to patients and physicians that managed care can embrace, and enjoy Intellectual Properties that provides investors confidence. As pleased as I am with the strong financial performance we reported today, I am as enthusiastic about the company we are building for tomorrow.  Business development remain at the forefront in 2010. We completed the acquisition of biotech company\'s Ception Therapeutics with their lead compound CINQUIL for the treatment of eosinophilic asthma and initiated a Phase III program.  We completed the acquisition of BioAssets Development Corporation and their intellectual properties surrounding the use of anti-TNF antibodies injected epidurally for the treatment of psiatica[ph]. We have initiated a Phase I/II study with our proprietary anti-TNF molecule.  We entered into an agreement with ChemGenex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. ChemGenex\'s product candidate Omapro, shows promise to the treatment of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia patients who have failed or are intolerant to Gleevec and one other tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Together with ChemGenex, we are analyzing the Phase III data of a possible submission to the FDA later this year.  We formed a strategic alliance with Mesoblast Limited, which allows us to participate in the entirely new field for us, Regenerative Medicine. Mesoblast Mesenchymal Precursor Cells or MPCs produce slight declines and/or growth factors that induce endogenous tissue repair or salt proliferation. This new technology has enormous potential. Our agreement provides us with global rights in three treatment areas. Cardiovascular, core blood expansion, and central nervous system. Mesoblast recently announced encouraging data from their Phase II program in congestive heart failure. This control study demonstrates patients with congestive heart failure who were injected with Revascor, Mesoblast\'s allogeneic MPCs have reduced rates of major adverse cardiac events, cardiac-related hospitalizations and mortality. This is the largest opportunity in our pipeline. In a separate study, core blood stem cells cocultured with the MPCs showed a 44-fold volume expansion. Subsequently utilized in hematopoietic stem cell transplants, patients demonstrated shorter time to neutrafil [ph] and place engraftment when compared to historical controls obtained from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research Registry.  During 2011, we plan to begin a Phase II study in patients who have suffered a mild myocardial infraction. Revasco will be tested in patients immediately after they undergo a standard angioplasty stent procedure to open a blocked coronary artery. The proof of concept of this procedure was validated in a large animal study. The study demonstrated that Revasco can be injected safely into the coronary artery after a myocardial infarction, with improvement seen versus controls and injection fraction and myocardial perfusion.  During 2011, we will work with Mesoblast to finalize all CMC requirements. After completion we plan to initiate Phase III programs for both congestive heart failure and bone marrow transplants early in 2012. From a patient, scientific, medical and business perspective, we are very excited about the use of [indiscernible]. Mesenchymal Precursor Cells have the potential to change the face of medicine and transform Cephalon. The nearest term opportunity in our pipeline is our tamper-deterrent extended release hydrocodone product for chronic pain. We expect to see Phase III results from this program by the end of this year with an FDA submission planned for early 2012. Our goal is to be first to market with the twice-daily acetaminophen-free [ph] tamper-deterrent product.  The label expansion for program for NUVIGIL and bipolar depression is advancing according to plan. Two of the three Phase III studies are on track to be completed by the end of this year. The third is scheduled for completion in the second quarter of 2012. If the first two studies are positive, and the subsequent submission is approved by the FDA, we will be prepared to launch in 2013. This would mark the first indication outside of the weight category for this franchise, and represents a large opportunity to help millions of patients suffering from bipolar depression.  Enrollment in our Phase III program with CINQUIL for  Eosinophilic asthma is under way. The Phase II data demonstrates the consistently positive signal in CINQUIL numerous endpoints including the Asthma-Control-Questionnaire FEV1, FEC and clinical asthma exacerbations. These data suggest that CINQUIL has the potential to treat severe asthmatics with elevated eosinophilic counts. We expect to complete the Phase III program in 2013 and are targeting 2014 as the potential launch year for CINQUIL. Our product candidate, LUPUZOR, the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus is currently in a Phase IIb program. This summer we will review the interim results of this study. If these data are positive, we will begin the Phase III program for the second half of this year. We also continue to make progress with our Phase III study of TREANDA for frontline treatment of indolent non-Hodgkin\'s lymphoma. We have now enrolled 80% of the required patients for this study and we expect response data by the end of 2011. In addition, we have an extensive Phase II pipeline, which includes our anti-TNF antibody for sciatica, TREANDA combined with Rituxan for mantle cell lymphoma, our proteasome inhibitor for multiple myeloma, and our part inhibitor for tumors with DNA repair mismatch on non-small cell lung cancer.  Yesterday we announced our option deal with Alba Therapeutics Corp., a privately held biopharmaceutical company. Under the agreement we have an option to purchase all of Alba\'s assets relating to their product candidate, larazotide acetate for the treatment of celiac disease.  In an earlier Phase II study, a signal of efficacy was seen. But the endpoint chosen for that study may not have been sufficiently specific to that disease. Utilizing our more disease specific primary endpoint, Alba will be initiating a new Phase IIb study in 2011. Should that study be successful, we will exercise our option and move forward to Phase III studies. There is currently no approved treatment to celiac disease, which affects more than 2 million people in the U.S. alone. With five Phase III programs planned for 2011, and three additional Phase III programs planned for 2012, we have one of the most promising late stage pipelines in the industry today.  We continued our geographic diversification in 2010 with the acquisition of Mepha AG. Mepha roughly doubled our x U.S. business on an annualized basis with the diversified product base in Europe Africa and the Middle East. With our expanded global capabilities, we are launching selected branded product in over a dozen new countries and more than 50 branded generic products during the 2011, 2012 timeframe.  As we turn to our existing business today, we reported that during 2010, we again delivered strong financial results. Sales and adjusted net income both exceeded the high end of our guidance range and set new records for the company. This strong performance was led by TREANDA. Yearly sales of TREANDA grew 77%. We remain on track in our efforts to expand the label with our program to secure a frontline indication for TREANDA and indolent non-Hodgkin\'s lymphoma. Following the completion of extensive data monitoring, we plan to file the StiL Group study with the FDA around the middle of this year.  Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, our own frontline study continues to progress. We remain confident that TREANDA will continue to grow within its current indications, and also has the potential for expanded utility based upon the outcome of ongoing clinical trials. The NUVIGIL launch continues to track ahead of other recent second-generation product launches in the industry. We will utilize the positive results from our recently completed Phase IV clinical trial in shift work disorder patients to continue to gain market share. I previously mentioned, our efforts to expand the label to NUVIGIL to include an indication of adjunctive therapy for bipolar disorder. If the bipolar program is successful, we expect NUVIGIL to have the opportunity to become a more widely prescribed medication than PROVIGIL was at its peak.  The pain franchise remains a stable contributor to our top and bottom line. Sales growth of FENTORA in the U.S., EFFENTORA in Europe and the addition of pain products from Mepha resulted in total franchise growth of 6%.  In summary, we are using the cash flow generator from our existing product portfolio to build a world-class late stage clinical pipeline. We expect to continue to add additional product candidates from both our internal discovery and business development assets. Now Wilco will discuss our financial performance Wilco Groenhuysen Thank you, Kevin. Today we reported our 2010 financial results. We again generated record sales and earnings for the year. Sales increased 28% over 2009 and $2.76 billion. And basic adjusted net income per common share for the year increased 35% to $8.74 based on an average 75.2 million shares outstanding.  Adjusted net income for the year was $657 million, an increase of 40% over 2009. CNS franchise sales increased 18% above 2009 to $1.39 billion. Pain franchise sales increased 6% to $526 million. Oncology franchise sales increased 53% to $514 million due primarily to strong TREANDA sales of $393 million. Other sales were $327 million compared to $142 million for the same period last year, due primarily to the acquisition of Mepha AG, which contributed $183 million to this category.  Since the acquisition of Mepha on April 9, 2010, total sales by Mepha over all franchises amounted to $259 million. As expected, our business continues to generate strong positive cash flow. In 2010, we delivered net cash provided by operating activities of $782 million. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of more than $1.16 billion. Our goal is to maintain wholesale inventory levels of between two to three weeks for our key products. During the quarter, total days on hand remained within this range. In January of 2011, we discontinued our 100-count bottles of PROVIGIL and a 60-count bottles of NUVIGIL and replaced them with the new 30-count bottles. This change should reduce retail inventory levels and consequently should reduce our exposure to returns. When compared to 2009, R&D, expense as adjusted for certain pro forma items, increased $17.9 million due primarily to the increased spend associated with clinical trials and the inclusion of Arana and Mepha costs. Adjusted SG&A increased $138 million for the year versus 2009, mainly due to the inclusion of Mepha and increased spending on the promotion of amongst others, NUVIGIL.  Our effective adjusted tax rate for the year was 33.4%. During the quarter, there were several adjustments that were made to arrive for the adjusted net income. The most significant of these were, we excluded $100 million associated with the acquisition of worldwide licensed rights to Mesoblast proprietary technology platform.  We excluded $30.5 million from cost of sales associated with the ongoing amortization of acquired intangible assets and accelerated depreciation related to restructuring. We excluded $15.4 million associated with non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt. And we excluded the tax effect of these items and other charges. Based on our current outlook, we have raised 2011 guidance. Total net sales guidance is now between $3.015 and $3.095 billion, and guidance for the CNS franchise between $1.45 billion and $1.49 billion. The pain franchise is between $540 million and $570 million; the oncology franchise is between $570 million and $600 million, and our guidance for other products sales is between $420 million and $450 million. Adjusted R&D and SG&A expenditures are targeted to be between $520 million and $540 million and $970 million and $1 billion respectively. Guidance for adjusted net income is between $665 million and $688 million, which equates to a basic adjusted income per common share of between $8.70 and $9, assuming 76.4 million shares outstanding. Our assumed tax rate for the year is approximately 33%.  We are also introducing first quarter 2011 guidance. Our sales guidance for the first quarter is between $725 million to $755 million. Consistent with previous years, our sales guidance does not include other revenues. Adjusted net income guidance is between $144 million and $159 million, which equates to a basic adjusted income per common share of between $1.90 and $2.10, based upon 75.8 million shares outstanding and a tax rate of approximately 33%. In summary, 2010 marks another record year for the company. Looking forward, I\'m confident that we have positioned Cephalon with a rich pipeline. Our goal is to deliver new therapeutics to under-served populations and sustainable value creation that will reward shareholders.  That concludes our opening remarks. We will now open this call to you and your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And we\'ll go first to Manoj Garg with Soleil Securities. Manoj Garg - Soleil Securities Group, Inc. PROVIGIL came in a little bit more than we would have expected. Can you just comment on inventory there? J. Buchi I think its safe to say that we didn\'t see anything that can change the inventory levels, but I will -- Wilco, you can fill on that. Wilco Groenhuysen PROVIGIL sales came in slightly higher than expected because we had somewhat higher scripts than expected. Inventory levels remains relatively sluggish with no significant development. And as I mentioned earlier on, in the first quarter with a reduction of the bottle 30, we did see a little bit of sales impact in the first few weeks of January. Towards the end of the year, we see no increase in wholesale inventory levels. Manoj Garg - Soleil Securities Group, Inc. On the updated 2011 CNS guidance, I\'m assuming that this is largely driven by PROVIGIL. So can you just comment or give us an updated conversion expectations for 2011? J. Buchi Bob, you want to handle that? Robert Repella When you look at NUVIGIL, our focus going forward is really on expansion, we\'re focused on shift work disorder, and we\'re no longer concentrating on conversion of appropriate medafinil patients. Actually when you look at NUVIGIL, what we\'ve seen recently is approximately 80% of the business is coming from our expansion efforts in shift work disorder and treated LSA. And about 20% really is now coming from conversion of medafinil patients. So we move in the direction of expansion and that\'s where we expect to realize our sustained growth in 2011. Manoj Garg - Soleil Securities Group, Inc. So I think you had commented last quarter that by the end of \'11 you would\'ve expect 50% to 60% conversion. Is that still true? Is that what we should model or... J. Buchi So from an overall perspective, our target remains to have NUVIGIL become the preferred product in the weight category before or by April 2012. And as you know, our market share right now is around 40%, that\'s how we ended the year in 2010. We expect to continue to grow that throughout 2011 through our focus on expansion in shift work disorder. When you look at shift work disorder, there\'s about 12 million individuals in the U.S. that are working shifts that struggle with excessive sleepiness. And we think that\'s our greatest opportunity for growth over the next 12 to 15 months. And that will allow us to continue to gain share. So those are our target to be the preferred product in the category, and we do have a Phase IV study now, the results that we just released, that will give us the momentum behind the brands that we\'re looking for. Because it looks at not only wakefulness late in the shift, but also looks at wakefulness during the commute home and also has a functionality measure based on the gas scale included in that study. And clearly the NUVIGIL cohort was statistically significant in terms of superiority of outcomes in that study across those endpoints. So we think we\'re poised to really drive growth in the shift work disorder segment this year. Operator And we\'ll take our next question from Randall Stanicky with Goldman Sachs. Randall Stanicky - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. I wasn\'t clear, are we still thinking about 50% to 60% in terms of the conversion rate for NUVIGIL? J. Buchi That\'s our target. Our target remains to be the preferred brand by the time it\'s provisionary. So, yes. Randall Stanicky - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. In terms of -- you guys have been active on the business development front. You have a lot of cash, over $1 billion generating a lot of cash. How should we think about two things, one, share buybacks versus potentially bigger deals going forward here, and then some of the areas that you talked about historically in terms of geography, any change in your thinking on that front? J. Buchi In terms of future deals, I think we believe, at this point in time, that it\'s kind of a target-rich environment out there. We\'re seeing some transactions that are potentially interesting. And so we intend, we fully intend to continue the momentum we have in business development. Having said that, business development has the uncertain signs. So there\'s no guarantees but we\'re certainly still out there looking. In terms of your question on larger deals, you know what, it\'s interesting we look at larger deals on a pretty regular basis. The challenge we tend to have is the larger opportunities tend to be public companies with pretty substantial market caps, pretty well vented and pretty well understood by the market. And we see much less opportunities to create significant value in those types of opportunities because they are so well vetted. And so, not withstanding the fact that we all look at the large transactions, we tend to just find more opportunity in the smaller, single product companies. In terms of share buybacks, As I say, I think we\'d rather focus on expanding the business and to the extent we think that we can still create a lot of shareholder value by entering into new transactions. I think we\'d rather do that. Operator And we\'ll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co First question was just on R&D and what\'s kind of behind the increased guidance for R&D in 2011. I\'m assuming that\'s the recent Mesoblast deal or is that something else? And when we think about 2012 start of Phase III programs for Revascor, can you just give us a flavor of what size, scope, and duration of studies we should anticipate? J. Buchi I\'ll answer the first part. The increase in R&D guidance is principally related to large transactions supporting that product. And I\'ll turn it over to Lesley in terms of clinical programs. Lesley Russell I think the size of the clinical programs -- I think we\'ll need reasonable safety numbers. This is a new procedure. So I think around sort of 1,500 patients mark for patient exposure. The size of the actual efficacy study will really be dependent on the effect size that we expect to see. And based on the 50-patient study it was pretty significant. That said though, we\'re always more conservative as we go into Phase III. So look around the sort of 400 to 500 patient mark for efficacy, with around 1,500 total exposure. Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co And just on duration of those studies, what should think about? Lesley Russell We should think about the primary efficacy outcome measure being events [ph] at one year. Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co I know you haven\'t given 2012 guidance at this point, but just from a high-level, how should we be thinking about the SG&A spend at Cephalon as you approach the provisional path in expiration. It seems like you\'ve got a number of important late stage programs running on the R&D side, but would you consider a meaningfully smaller SG&A footprint or do you intend to keep spend kind of somewhat close to current levels as you consider things like the individual opportunity in by bipolar and your tamper-resistant opioid [ph] launch et cetera? J. Buchi You\'re asking about SG&A, or R&D, or both? Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co SG&A. p id="192701" name="J. Buchi" /> As you know there is no one currently promoting PROVIGIL in the organization. So the SG&A organization that we have is sized for this quarter and commercial opportunities are currently being promoted. We always review size of the organization, is it appropriate? Those types of things, but certainly trying to operate as efficiently as we can and to limit fixed cost with the extent that we can. But having said that, when PROVIGIL goes away I would expect the amount to decrease in SG&A unless something else happens in the organization which we\'re not currently planning for. Looking at it around in terms of R&D, the R&D spend is going to be heavily dependent upon the progress of the Phase III clinical trials. The current expectation is that we\'ll be spending a very substantial amount of money in 2011, and the significant piece of that will continue into 2012. So we\'re very conscious about cost structure. We\'re also very conscious in continuing to investing for our future. Operator And we\'ll go next to Annabel Samimy with Stifel, Nicolaus. Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. You clearly have all been making a very rapid expansion in some of these biotech pipelines. How can you help us make these opportunities more tangible for us rather than just feeling like pie-in-the-sky biotech high-risk opportunities? And what can we expect to come to market first out of all these that you\'ve sort of laid out for us? J. Buchi I think the first to market is most likely to be the [indiscernible] product. It\'s hard for me to classify hydrocodone as a biotech type of product. Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. No, I guess I\'m talking about more of the investments that you personally made. J. Buchi I think in terms of the other investments, if you look at the characteristics of those investments, I say the riskiness of that varies across the portfolio. I\'d make an argument that the [indiscernible] asthma is probably on the lower risk scale for the opportunities that we have in the clinic. So the Phase IIB data, the placebo-controlled study. We understand the mechanism there. [indiscernible] So I wouldn\'t view that one as being anti-risk maybe of some others. And I would point out that all the high-tech investments that we\'re making, including risky areas like [indiscernible] we\'re making those investments on the basis of placebo-controlled, human clinical data. So that is risky but that solid genome data is supporting the efficacy behind this at this point in time. The rest will come out in Phase III, and hopefully those Phase III studies will start rolling out in 2011, 2012, and try to provide for more companies. Operator And we\'ll go next to Gary Nachman with Susquehanna Financial Group. Gary Nachman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP First question is on Mepha, the sales rebounded nicely from the third quarter. Is that a good run rate that we should use for 2011? Are you guys seeing any incremental pricing pressure in Switzerland? And did you mention the product launches that you\'re expecting in that business? If you did, I may have missed that. If you could repeat it. Wilco Groenhuysen I think the fourth quarter run rate is indeed a better reflection of what we expect going forward explained in the third quarter. One of the reasons why the sales are slightly low was production in pipeline for the $89 million that we reported in this quarter and we expect to see substantially some volume growth. There is price erosion undoubtedly in Europe not just focused on Switzerland, but in other countries as well. Historically, you see 2% to 3% price erosion in business. We\'ve always been able to offset that with the volume increases and mix of improvements that we would expect that as well. J. Buchi In terms of new product launches, they kind of fall into two categories. The launches of our currently branded products into new territory. For example in places like Poland, Netherlands, Baltics, Czech Republic, those type of opportunities. There\'s then the continuing introduction of new brand of generics by Mepha, and that\'s a very long list of around 40 or 50 different compounds based on developing [indiscernible]. Gary Nachman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP Anything else you could do with AMRIX to try and turn the product around. They\'ve been trying for a few quarters now, and it seems to be struggling still. And have you made any changes to the pain cells for us or do you want to keep that intact in preparation for the tamper-deterrent hydrocodone product? Robert Repella We do expect to realize modest growth with AMRIX in 2011. We have made some adjustments to the sales force, and we\'ve implemented a plan of differential resourcing. And in essence, what we\'ve done is we\'ve deployed the sales force, not in a continuous fashion but we kind of put them into places where we have the best opportunity for growth. So we have a high density of high decile Doctors, they have good access into those offices. And importantly, there is solid reimbursement for the brand in those MSAs and geographies. So we\'ve got our people positioned where the growth opportunity exists, and we continue to be aggressive in our support of patients in terms of helping them with our out-of-pocket costs, with our co-pay card program and we piloted a new program last year. We like the results that we saw in the four states we piloted it. So we rolled it out on a national basis this year. And we think those combined efforts will give us again an opportunity for modest growth, combined with additional efficiency will help contribute also to a stronger bottom line. Gary Nachman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP Will you make any changes to the infrastructure for the tamper-deterrent product? Robert Repella We\'ve got a whole series of contingency plans that look at our pain franchise and certainly, we\'re looking at the right balance for FENTORA and AMRIX and TD hydrocodone when it gets here. But we\'ll make the adjustments as we get a little bit closer and better understand what the portfolio looks like. Operator We\'ll take our next questions from Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny Gal - Bernstein Research First, Europe is down as an area where there\'s a lot of seasonality in generics and we don\'t always have a great visibility from the outside, how the seasons progressed for the Mepha business. Can you just give us an idea in percentages how should we think about this in terms of percentage of revenue coming in every quarter due to seasonality, and obviously there is some growth superimposed on top of that. And second, if you guys give us a little bit of insight into how PBMs would think about hydrocodone? One concern I\'ve been hearing is that given your history as a company that prices its products well, managed care might be somewhat resistant to adopting new product early. Have you guys modeled what managed care might do here, and how to think about it? J. Buchi I\'ll answer the first question, then I\'ll hand it over to Bob to talk about the strategy around hydrocodone. There really is very little seasonal fluctuation that we would expect in the Mepha business over the year. I think that maybe more seasonality in the U.S. but the European business is pretty stable across the year. So you can almost literally just divide it by four and that\'s pretty close to the right number. Robert Repella We think we have a unique opportunity to be first in class with our tamper-deterrent hydrocodone product, and that it will be tamper-deterrent A; B, it will be long-acting; and C, APAP-free [acetaminophen-free] which is important to the marketplace in terms of managing potential toxicities with APAP products. So, from a managed-care perspective, we believe that they\'ll see the value of that product in terms of its differentiation, and we don\'t anticipate that it\'ll be problematic in terms of gaining reimbursement for that product at launch. J. Buchi We would expect the price and volume [indiscernible] to be there. I wouldn\'t characterize it as a company\'s overall, aggressively priced products [indiscernible]. Operator And we\'ll take our next question from Raghuram Selvaraju with Noble Financial Group. Raghuram Selvaraju - Rodman & Renshaw First of all, regarding TREANDA, I just sort of wanted to get positional color on what you see as the expectation for the product growth capacity without formal FDA approval and front-line at HL or mantle cell, and how much growth do you think the product still has left in it? Without factoring in the impact of the FDA taking into account the StiL study and the current you\'re running with Rituxan? Robert Repella So TREANDA had very strong growth in 2010. As Kevin commented earlier over 70% growth, 2010 versus 2009. That\'s a growth curve that would be difficult to continue to replicate year-on-year. But when we look at the opportunity for TREANDA going forward, clearly, there is still many patients in the U.S. who suffer with CLL and NHL that could be candidates for the product. When you look at the prevalence data in the U.S. we\'re talking about just over 50,000 CLL patients and just over 100,000 NHL patients. So there\'s a lot of opportunity for growth within the labeled indications and utilization patterns, and then of course in the marketplace, there continues to be independent third-party data that is generated. And certainly, healthcare professionals look at that and evaluate that data. That\'s certainly separate and apart from anything that we do commercially or promotionally and we don\'t quantify that impact specifically, but it does play into the growth potential for the brand. But we think again, just based on the demographics that TREANDA has opportunity for sustained continued growth in 2011 and beyond. J. Buchi I think it\'s fair to say as well that the combination of the StiL data and the phase III program that we\'re running in frontline we do very much hope that we\'ll be able to get the [indiscernible]. Raghuram Selvaraju - Rodman & Renshaw Can you say anything more about the efforts ongoing to identify a successor molecule to TREANDA at this point in time? J. Buchi No not at this point in time. We\'re still looking at some alternatives. I would say though that the success of molecules that we\'re looking at the TREANDA our new NDAs I wouldn\'t use them as line presenters. There are not products that would be bioequivalent from [indiscernible]. What we\'re interested in looking at with TREANDA is whether or not we can develop a product that has the same efficacy, if you will, it has an extended DK profile suitable for use for mostly bookings. So this will be a new NDA and not just a traditional line extension. Raghuram Selvaraju - Rodman & Renshaw With respect to the recent Alba deal, could you comment on how large the celiac disease and market opportunity is as you see it? And what perspective there might be for pricing of a drug like larazotide acetate into syndication? Robert Repella We believe this is a large market opportunity, potentially over 2 million patients in the U.S. That provides an excellent revenue opportunity for us and meeting an unmet need in the marketplace. It\'s too early to comment on pricing at this point. We\'ll do our sensitivity analysis as we conduct our market research assessment as we move forward but we remain excited about the possibility of meeting the needs of these patients who to date really don\'t have any solutions for the challenge that they face. Operator We\'ll go next to Greg Gilbert with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Gregory Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch How would you characterize the pace of the NUVIGIL cases versus the generics? And what are some relevant milestones you can point to over the next 12 months or so on that front? Gerald Pappert The pace discovery is proceeding with respect to the cases against each of the defendant. There is no trial date that has yet been set by the District Court in Delaware. So there is not a specific trial date I can point you to. The only other relevant probably timeline for your interest would be the expiration of the respective 30-month stays as to each defendant which begins in third week in April roughly and then continue into May and June. Gregory Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch A bigger picture question for Kevin, I think some folks have already touched on this, but Cephalon\'s clearly done a good job in finding and launching drugs in the past but I sense that there\'s a lot of skepticism among investors as to whether Cephalon is the right company to find and develop these more novel, more biotechie products. So short of fast forwarding to the clinical data readouts for all these novel programs, how do you try to make investors comfortable that you\'ll pursue a balanced approach between the novel development investments versus -- and I know the risk varies across those, but you know what I mean in broad terms, and bouncing those with sort of less risky capital deployment strategies. J. Buchi I think if you look back at history of Cephalon, our largest product, PROVIGIL, was certainly in the category of a risky investment by the time we made it. Phase I and new therapeutic area has no currently available therapy and our history as an organization has been to balance those types of opportunities with the affects which was already approved when we acquired it. I think the strategy is largely unchanged. I think we\'ve got a balanced approach, we continued to do transactions like the Mepha transaction, which was a transaction of raw products into our portfolio for the European market, we\'d be very suitable for that market. And against that, we balance things like [indiscernible], which obviously has a technology which is more risky. I think the way we get comfortable with the risk, and I don\'t know if this helps investors at all is that if you put aside the nature of the technology and look at the nature of the clinical data that supports these acquisitions, all of these product candidates forget how they work. They all have human Phase II clinical data with placebo-controlled studies that is officially and internally consistent if you would feel compelled to say these products are doing something in these patients. That\'s how we get comfortable with it internally. Hopefully as we tell that story to investors, obviously they\'re going to be some people more skeptical than others. As we tell that story, hopefully people start to believe and hopefully as the data starts to roll in for the Phase III studies, as I said, that will cement that belief. Operator And we\'ll go next to David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray. David Amsellem - Piper Jaffray Companies Just wanted to touch on the hydrocodone product. Right now you\'d be the second hydrocodone product without APAP to get to market after the Zogenix product. So I guess the question here is can you comment on how you think you are differentiated on that product? J. Buchi I\'ll make a couple of comments. First of all I\'m not sure that we\'ll be second to market behind Zogenix. I would imagine being in a race with them, but I think we\'re enrolling rapidly and I think we have a real good shot at being to market ahead of them.  Having said that, their product is my understanding, does indeed lack APAP but I don\'t believe it has any kind of deterrent properties and I don\'t believe it\'s an extended-release or I could be wrong there. So I think we\'ll be right there with them, but I think we\'ll have a much better product when it comes to market. IS that fair, Bob? Gerald Pappert The big differentiation point would be the tamper-deterrent. So APAP-free and long acting will probably be the points of similarity and but the TD is really important to the marketplace, and we think we\'ll be at the point at which we kind of diverge. David Amsellem - Piper Jaffray Companies And then the second question, back to business development, I guess the Mepha acquisition was unique in the sense that it was the departure from a lot of the pipeline-oriented transactions that you\'re doing. So I guess the question here is what\'s your appetite for doing more deals along the lines of brand generics or even vanilla generics going forward whether it\'s oversees or domestic? J. Buchi I don\'t think you\'ll see us do a generic deal in the United States. I think we do transactions that we believe are appropriate for the local market. And I think in many parts of Europe and the developing world, a brand of generic strategy can make a lot of sense. I don\'t just say it\'s not unique. We did a transaction, as you probably recall, several years before which was also the fact of the European market for the oncology space. My view of the U.S. generic marketplace is that the U.S. market doesn\'t pay for quality in generics, it just pays for the cheapest possible generic. That is in stark contrast to many other parts of the world where the quality of the product and the quality of the brand counts. So I think additional brands of generics types of deals in other parts of the world where that makes sense potentially we\'ll certainly look at those. But I wouldn\'t count on us doing a generic deal in the U.S. Operator And we\'ll go next to Marc Goodman with UBS. Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank First of all can you talk about the SG&A level in the quarter and what you spent on and whether you strategically were going to spend that at the beginning of the quarter or did you spend more as you saw that the top line was going to be better as the quarter progressed? Wilco Groenhuysen No we can\'t let our spending be determined by the trends that we see in our top line, yearly observations. Increase in SG&A has been slightly variable in nature. Largely driven by marketing initiatives such as the European launch of some of this is related to product launches and are largely variable, more focused on managing fixed cost and increasing operating leverage in 2012. Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank Just so I understand the delta from maybe an average of second and third quarter to the fourth quarter. You were saying there was launches in Europe that cost extra spending and then what else? Wilco Groenhuysen We have continued spent in NUVIGIL in the past we\'ve spoken about our WebMD campaign. We spent some money on that as you know we did a couple of transactions in the latter part in most of the increase in the third quarter of 2010 in our prepared remarks. Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank Can you talk about the WebMD campaign and what you\'re seen so far? J. Buchi Maybe Bob can say a few things about how that\'s progressing? Lesley Russell It\'s a core platform for us in terms of our Internet efforts to communicate with potential patients. We\'ve seen significant interest in terms of the number of visitors to the site that is educational in nature around shift work disorder and treated OSA and the number of patients that have followed on to gain information about NUVIGIL and potentially have a discussion with their healthcare provider about NUVIGIL and whether it\'s appropriate for them in terms of managing the excessive sleepiness associated with their shift work disorder or their treated OSA. So we\'re seeing good responsiveness and now we\'re at a point where we can start to evaluate how that responsiveness translates into discussions with the healthcare provider and then eventually a NUVIGIL prescription for appropriate patients. So I think as we get later into this quarter and into the second quarter, we\'ll have a much better view of the impact to that program. But again, it\'s part of our overall effort to leave no stone unturned in terms of consumers, patients, healthcare professionals, payers, managed care to ensure that we do everything to drive appropriate growth of NUVIGIL. Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank Can you talk about when the strategy changed from not switching patients from PROVIGIL to NUVIGIL to just focusing on the new patients? Robert Repella So we started the transition, I would say late summer in the third quarter. And have fully executed that change in the fourth quarter of last year and we talked a little bit about it on the last call, in terms of that transition being driven by the fact that in terms of PROVIGIL patients that are in our reach, we think we\'ve gotten the majority of those in terms of transition of patients that are on appropriate indications. Those that are on doses that we can move from PROVIGIL to NUVIGIL. And so with the opportunity that exists for expansion and where we were with the original conversion effort we thought that the time is right to make the transition. So late third quarter into the fourth quarter and now our focus in 2011 is growth through expansion. So we\'ve had nice results so far, we crossed over in the fourth quarter the 1 million prescription line in total since the launch of NUVIGIL. So that was a nice milestone for the brand and again, we think with the new data that we have from our Phase IV study, positions us well for sustained growth. Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank When I look at PROVIGIL plus NUVIGIL together as one franchise it still looks to me like it\'s declining. August, September, October, November, December. Why is that? Robert Repella If you look at the category in the latter part of 2010, we saw some stabilization compared to what we had seen previously and we talked a little bit about PROVIGIL\'s demonstrating a bit more strength that we had anticipated and the impact that, that had on our overall company performance. So while the category was declining consistently through the middle of 2010, again in the back half, we saw that decline slow down a bit and for the market as, we look at it, 2011, we expect it to be stable to slightly down, but not on the order of magnitude that we\'ve seen in previous years when you\'re looking at \'09 versus \'08, for example. Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank So by the end of the year you switched over a little bit more than 50% like you said, and then you\'re assuming that NUVIGIL will grow in 2012. J. Buchi The only thing to remember about 2010 is that there was really no new data for any of these products. We do have the advantage that we have some good data now [indiscernible] talked about. And hopefully, that new data will allow us to improve the penetration of NUVIGIL and continue to grow the brand. Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank What are your thoughts on the emerging markets and maybe doing some deals there? Obviously all the pharma industry is moving there. What are your thoughts? I know you have a small operation there so far. J. Buchi Yes, we do. My hope is that studies with a number of our branded products in that region, in China specifically. As we talked historically, we would very much like to do a focus transaction to get commercial presence in China. Assets in China tend to go at pretty fancy prices right now and as you know, we\'ve always been kind of value buyers. I think if we cannot find something which looks attractive commercially to us, then we will build our own infrastructure slowly over time and commercialize our products as we go forward starting with PROVIGIL at the end of this year. Operator And we\'ll go next to Nick Bishop shop with Cowen and Co. Nick Bishop We discussed a lot about your acquisition strategy. I guess you haven\'t specifically commented on whether you\'d be looking to buy somebody -- buy a company with some revenues or earnings ahead of the PROVIGIL expiration. J. Buchi In a vacuum, would we like to buy a company that has a good revenue for a fair price, sure. We don\'t see a lot of assets to kind of fit that category. Assets that are suitable for specialty marketing efforts that has some reasonable potential for growth that had long ideas with a fair price. But we\'ll always open to look for those kinds of things. It\'s a pretty scared landscape for those types of assets. Nick Bishop I was wondering do you have any updates on what might be happening -- the litigation with Watson around Fentora. Can we expect to see something on that soon? Gerald Pappert This is Gerry Pappert. As you may know, the court entered an order the other day, asking the parties for their thoughts on the practical implications of the court\'s ruling at least initially on some but not all of the patents that issue in this case. And recall there are three patents, and two of them are listed in the Orange book, one of them is not. The court\'s order indicated that the judge may be prepared to rule on the patents listed in the Orange book but not yet prepared to rule on the non-orange book. They\'ve asked the parties to provide the court with our views on the practical implications of approaching it in that fashion if you will. So we will be doing that and supplying the court with our two-page letter briefs by Tuesday the 15th which is the deadline in the order. And I don\'t think it\'s unreasonable to expect the ruling on the Orange book patents in fairly due course after their submission. Operator And we have time for one more questioner. We\'ll go next to David Buck with Buckingham Research Group. David Buck - Buckingham Research First, can you just review the price increase activity that we saw in the fourth quarter or any activity first quarter? Secondly, if you look at the R&D number that went up this year for the Mesoblast partnership, can you talk a little bit about what the Delta might be in 2012 from 2011? And just in regard to the Revascor study, how expensive would you expect that to be? And then another one for Kevin, you heard actually the comment about the riskiness of R&D strategy and the riskiness of the profile. One commercial question related to SG&A is when you see provision go in April in 2011 -- April in 2012, why wouldn\'t the recent flexing of spending on SG&A if NUVIGIL sort of peeks, and you have NUVIGIL no longer growing. J. Buchi That maybe some level of questioning. Depending upon the outlook depending upon the result of the bipolar studies. Depending upon the kind of a lot of things. I don\'t want to kid anyone that we don\'t think seriously the fact that we\'re losing a product that today is $70 billion. So we\'re not going to go to the certain the important for the branded sales, authorized generic Europe and so on. You should expect a significant decrease in revenue in 2012 beginning at 2013. We would expect to start cutting back after that as some of these new opportunities start to get launched and start to get some traction. There maybe some room to flex SG&A somewhat but my earlier point as you\'re well aware there is no one out there currently detailing PROVIGIL today. On the R&D side, it\'s difficult to predict what the R&D line is going to look like because we have multiple phase three trials going on now, which will be continuing into 2012. Some will be concluding this year, but many will be concluding in 2012 and a number starting up in 2012. So the R&D spend really depends on the success rate that we have. I have a much better feel for that as we go through this year. Your other question, I think I was going to turn over it over to Bob and I forgot what it was anyway. David Buck - Buckingham Research Price increase activity and maybe just a thought on formulary for NUVIGIL in 2012 J. Buchi I\'ll take the crash question and then Bob can take your question on formulary. A total of 2010 price by 10% and lower price also by 10% and mid-January by about 5% and PROVIGIL prices by about 10%. Robert Repella Dave, what was your formulary question? We lost that one. David Buck - Buckingham Research As you look towards April 2012, can you give some sense of what you think the formulary position for NUVIGIL would be? Robert Repella We have long-term agreements in place with the majority of our customers in terms of access reimbursement and formulary position. We think that combined with the possibility of new indications like bipolar will have our customers look to the value, the increasing value that NUVIGIL can provide going forward. We also, when we look at the market, we recognize that and we talk to customers that therapeutic interventions, they\'re costly, they\'re time consuming they take a lot of energy. And we don\'t expect with the agreements we have in place that customers are going to want to move in that direction. So we expect a prescription written for NUVIGIL in 2012 and beyond will get filled with NUVIGIL, again because the agreements we have in place and the value the product provides. And when you look at the category, relatively speaking, it is not that large with these customers so again, we don\'t expect them to be that interested in taking specific action. They\'ll realize their windfall, their economic gain when medafinil goes generic. But we think we\'ll have a long-term relationship with them as it relates to NUVIGIL.

Thank you!', 'qAndAText': 'Operator [Operator Instructions] And we\'ll go first to Manoj Garg with Soleil Securities. Manoj Garg - Soleil Securities Group, Inc. PROVIGIL came in a little bit more than we would have expected. Can you just comment on inventory there? J. Buchi I think its safe to say that we didn\'t see anything that can change the inventory levels, but I will -- Wilco, you can fill on that. Wilco Groenhuysen PROVIGIL sales came in slightly higher than expected because we had somewhat higher scripts than expected. Inventory levels remains relatively sluggish with no significant development. And as I mentioned earlier on, in the first quarter with a reduction of the bottle 30, we did see a little bit of sales impact in the first few weeks of January. Towards the end of the year, we see no increase in wholesale inventory levels. Manoj Garg - Soleil Securities Group, Inc. On the updated 2011 CNS guidance, I\'m assuming that this is largely driven by PROVIGIL. So can you just comment or give us an updated conversion expectations for 2011? J. Buchi Bob, you want to handle that? Robert Repella When you look at NUVIGIL, our focus going forward is really on expansion, we\'re focused on shift work disorder, and we\'re no longer concentrating on conversion of appropriate medafinil patients. Actually when you look at NUVIGIL, what we\'ve seen recently is approximately 80% of the business is coming from our expansion efforts in shift work disorder and treated LSA. And about 20% really is now coming from conversion of medafinil patients. So we move in the direction of expansion and that\'s where we expect to realize our sustained growth in 2011. Manoj Garg - Soleil Securities Group, Inc. So I think you had commented last quarter that by the end of \'11 you would\'ve expect 50% to 60% conversion. Is that still true? Is that what we should model or... J. Buchi So from an overall perspective, our target remains to have NUVIGIL become the preferred product in the weight category before or by April 2012. And as you know, our market share right now is around 40%, that\'s how we ended the year in 2010. We expect to continue to grow that throughout 2011 through our focus on expansion in shift work disorder. When you look at shift work disorder, there\'s about 12 million individuals in the U.S. that are working shifts that struggle with excessive sleepiness. And we think that\'s our greatest opportunity for growth over the next 12 to 15 months. And that will allow us to continue to gain share. So those are our target to be the preferred product in the category, and we do have a Phase IV study now, the results that we just released, that will give us the momentum behind the brands that we\'re looking for. Because it looks at not only wakefulness late in the shift, but also looks at wakefulness during the commute home and also has a functionality measure based on the gas scale included in that study. And clearly the NUVIGIL cohort was statistically significant in terms of superiority of outcomes in that study across those endpoints. So we think we\'re poised to really drive growth in the shift work disorder segment this year. Operator And we\'ll take our next question from Randall Stanicky with Goldman Sachs. Randall Stanicky - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. I wasn\'t clear, are we still thinking about 50% to 60% in terms of the conversion rate for NUVIGIL? J. Buchi That\'s our target. Our target remains to be the preferred brand by the time it\'s provisionary. So, yes. Randall Stanicky - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. In terms of -- you guys have been active on the business development front. You have a lot of cash, over $1 billion generating a lot of cash. How should we think about two things, one, share buybacks versus potentially bigger deals going forward here, and then some of the areas that you talked about historically in terms of geography, any change in your thinking on that front? J. Buchi In terms of future deals, I think we believe, at this point in time, that it\'s kind of a target-rich environment out there. We\'re seeing some transactions that are potentially interesting. And so we intend, we fully intend to continue the momentum we have in business development. Having said that, business development has the uncertain signs. So there\'s no guarantees but we\'re certainly still out there looking. In terms of your question on larger deals, you know what, it\'s interesting we look at larger deals on a pretty regular basis. The challenge we tend to have is the larger opportunities tend to be public companies with pretty substantial market caps, pretty well vented and pretty well understood by the market. And we see much less opportunities to create significant value in those types of opportunities because they are so well vetted. And so, not withstanding the fact that we all look at the large transactions, we tend to just find more opportunity in the smaller, single product companies. In terms of share buybacks, As I say, I think we\'d rather focus on expanding the business and to the extent we think that we can still create a lot of shareholder value by entering into new transactions. I think we\'d rather do that. Operator And we\'ll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co First question was just on R&D and what\'s kind of behind the increased guidance for R&D in 2011. I\'m assuming that\'s the recent Mesoblast deal or is that something else? And when we think about 2012 start of Phase III programs for Revascor, can you just give us a flavor of what size, scope, and duration of studies we should anticipate? J. Buchi I\'ll answer the first part. The increase in R&D guidance is principally related to large transactions supporting that product. And I\'ll turn it over to Lesley in terms of clinical programs. Lesley Russell I think the size of the clinical programs -- I think we\'ll need reasonable safety numbers. This is a new procedure. So I think around sort of 1,500 patients mark for patient exposure. The size of the actual efficacy study will really be dependent on the effect size that we expect to see. And based on the 50-patient study it was pretty significant. That said though, we\'re always more conservative as we go into Phase III. So look around the sort of 400 to 500 patient mark for efficacy, with around 1,500 total exposure. Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co And just on duration of those studies, what should think about? Lesley Russell We should think about the primary efficacy outcome measure being events [ph] at one year. Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co I know you haven\'t given 2012 guidance at this point, but just from a high-level, how should we be thinking about the SG&A spend at Cephalon as you approach the provisional path in expiration. It seems like you\'ve got a number of important late stage programs running on the R&D side, but would you consider a meaningfully smaller SG&A footprint or do you intend to keep spend kind of somewhat close to current levels as you consider things like the individual opportunity in by bipolar and your tamper-resistant opioid [ph] launch et cetera? J. Buchi You\'re asking about SG&A, or R&D, or both? Christopher Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co SG&A. p id="192701" name="J. Buchi" /> As you know there is no one currently promoting PROVIGIL in the organization. So the SG&A organization that we have is sized for this quarter and commercial opportunities are currently being promoted. We always review size of the organization, is it appropriate? Those types of things, but certainly trying to operate as efficiently as we can and to limit fixed cost with the extent that we can. But having said that, when PROVIGIL goes away I would expect the amount to decrease in SG&A unless something else happens in the organization which we\'re not currently planning for. Looking at it around in terms of R&D, the R&D spend is going to be heavily dependent upon the progress of the Phase III clinical trials. The current expectation is that we\'ll be spending a very substantial amount of money in 2011, and the significant piece of that will continue into 2012. So we\'re very conscious about cost structure. We\'re also very conscious in continuing to investing for our future. Operator And we\'ll go next to Annabel Samimy with Stifel, Nicolaus. Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. You clearly have all been making a very rapid expansion in some of these biotech pipelines. How can you help us make these opportunities more tangible for us rather than just feeling like pie-in-the-sky biotech high-risk opportunities? And what can we expect to come to market first out of all these that you\'ve sort of laid out for us? J. Buchi I think the first to market is most likely to be the [indiscernible] product. It\'s hard for me to classify hydrocodone as a biotech type of product. Annabel Samimy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. No, I guess I\'m talking about more of the investments that you personally made. J. Buchi I think in terms of the other investments, if you look at the characteristics of those investments, I say the riskiness of that varies across the portfolio. I\'d make an argument that the [indiscernible] asthma is probably on the lower risk scale for the opportunities that we have in the clinic. So the Phase IIB data, the placebo-controlled study. We understand the mechanism there. [indiscernible] So I wouldn\'t view that one as being anti-risk maybe of some others. And I would point out that all the high-tech investments that we\'re making, including risky areas like [indiscernible] we\'re making those investments on the basis of placebo-controlled, human clinical data. So that is risky but that solid genome data is supporting the efficacy behind this at this point in time. The rest will come out in Phase III, and hopefully those Phase III studies will start rolling out in 2011, 2012, and try to provide for more companies. Operator And we\'ll go next to Gary Nachman with Susquehanna Financial Group. Gary Nachman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP First question is on Mepha, the sales rebounded nicely from the third quarter. Is that a good run rate that we should use for 2011? Are you guys seeing any incremental pricing pressure in Switzerland? And did you mention the product launches that you\'re expecting in that business? If you did, I may have missed that. If you could repeat it. Wilco Groenhuysen I think the fourth quarter run rate is indeed a better reflection of what we expect going forward explained in the third quarter. One of the reasons why the sales are slightly low was production in pipeline for the $89 million that we reported in this quarter and we expect to see substantially some volume growth. There is price erosion undoubtedly in Europe not just focused on Switzerland, but in other countries as well. Historically, you see 2% to 3% price erosion in business. We\'ve always been able to offset that with the volume increases and mix of improvements that we would expect that as well. J. Buchi In terms of new product launches, they kind of fall into two categories. The launches of our currently branded products into new territory. For example in places like Poland, Netherlands, Baltics, Czech Republic, those type of opportunities. There\'s then the continuing introduction of new brand of generics by Mepha, and that\'s a very long list of around 40 or 50 different compounds based on developing [indiscernible]. Gary Nachman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP Anything else you could do with AMRIX to try and turn the product around. They\'ve been trying for a few quarters now, and it seems to be struggling still. And have you made any changes to the pain cells for us or do you want to keep that intact in preparation for the tamper-deterrent hydrocodone product? Robert Repella We do expect to realize modest growth with AMRIX in 2011. We have made some adjustments to the sales force, and we\'ve implemented a plan of differential resourcing. And in essence, what we\'ve done is we\'ve deployed the sales force, not in a continuous fashion but we kind of put them into places where we have the best opportunity for growth. So we have a high density of high decile Doctors, they have good access into those offices. And importantly, there is solid reimbursement for the brand in those MSAs and geographies. So we\'ve got our people positioned where the growth opportunity exists, and we continue to be aggressive in our support of patients in terms of helping them with our out-of-pocket costs, with our co-pay card program and we piloted a new program last year. We like the results that we saw in the four states we piloted it. So we rolled it out on a national basis this year. And we think those combined efforts will give us again an opportunity for modest growth, combined with additional efficiency will help contribute also to a stronger bottom line. Gary Nachman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP Will you make any changes to the infrastructure for the tamper-deterrent product? Robert Repella We\'ve got a whole series of contingency plans that look at our pain franchise and certainly, we\'re looking at the right balance for FENTORA and AMRIX and TD hydrocodone when it gets here. But we\'ll make the adjustments as we get a little bit closer and better understand what the portfolio looks like. Operator We\'ll take our next questions from Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny Gal - Bernstein Research First, Europe is down as an area where there\'s a lot of seasonality in generics and we don\'t always have a great visibility from the outside, how the seasons progressed for the Mepha business. Can you just give us an idea in percentages how should we think about this in terms of percentage of revenue coming in every quarter due to seasonality, and obviously there is some growth superimposed on top of that. And second, if you guys give us a little bit of insight into how PBMs would think about hydrocodone? One concern I\'ve been hearing is that given your history as a company that prices its products well, managed care might be somewhat resistant to adopting new product early. Have you guys modeled what managed care might do here, and how to think about it? J. Buchi I\'ll answer the first question, then I\'ll hand it over to Bob to talk about the strategy around hydrocodone. There really is very little seasonal fluctuation that we would expect in the Mepha business over the year. I think that maybe more seasonality in the U.S. but the European business is pretty stable across the year. So you can almost literally just divide it by four and that\'s pretty close to the right number. Robert Repella We think we have a unique opportunity to be first in class with our tamper-deterrent hydrocodone product, and that it will be tamper-deterrent A; B, it will be long-acting; and C, APAP-free [acetaminophen-free] which is important to the marketplace in terms of managing potential toxicities with APAP products. So, from a managed-care perspective, we believe that they\'ll see the value of that product in terms of its differentiation, and we don\'t anticipate that it\'ll be problematic in terms of gaining reimbursement for that product at launch. J. Buchi We would expect the price and volume [indiscernible] to be there. I wouldn\'t characterize it as a company\'s overall, aggressively priced products [indiscernible]. Operator And we\'ll take our next question from Raghuram Selvaraju with Noble Financial Group. Raghuram Selvaraju - Rodman & Renshaw First of all, regarding TREANDA, I just sort of wanted to get positional color on what you see as the expectation for the product growth capacity without formal FDA approval and front-line at HL or mantle cell, and how much growth do you think the product still has left in it? Without factoring in the impact of the FDA taking into account the StiL study and the current you\'re running with Rituxan? Robert Repella So TREANDA had very strong growth in 2010. As Kevin commented earlier over 70% growth, 2010 versus 2009. That\'s a growth curve that would be difficult to continue to replicate year-on-year. But when we look at the opportunity for TREANDA going forward, clearly, there is still many patients in the U.S. who suffer with CLL and NHL that could be candidates for the product. When you look at the prevalence data in the U.S. we\'re talking about just over 50,000 CLL patients and just over 100,000 NHL patients. So there\'s a lot of opportunity for growth within the labeled indications and utilization patterns, and then of course in the marketplace, there continues to be independent third-party data that is generated. And certainly, healthcare professionals look at that and evaluate that data. That\'s certainly separate and apart from anything that we do commercially or promotionally and we don\'t quantify that impact specifically, but it does play into the growth potential for the brand. But we think again, just based on the demographics that TREANDA has opportunity for sustained continued growth in 2011 and beyond. J. Buchi I think it\'s fair to say as well that the combination of the StiL data and the phase III program that we\'re running in frontline we do very much hope that we\'ll be able to get the [indiscernible]. Raghuram Selvaraju - Rodman & Renshaw Can you say anything more about the efforts ongoing to identify a successor molecule to TREANDA at this point in time? J. Buchi No not at this point in time. We\'re still looking at some alternatives. I would say though that the success of molecules that we\'re looking at the TREANDA our new NDAs I wouldn\'t use them as line presenters. There are not products that would be bioequivalent from [indiscernible]. What we\'re interested in looking at with TREANDA is whether or not we can develop a product that has the same efficacy, if you will, it has an extended DK profile suitable for use for mostly bookings. So this will be a new NDA and not just a traditional line extension. Raghuram Selvaraju - Rodman & Renshaw With respect to the recent Alba deal, could you comment on how large the celiac disease and market opportunity is as you see it? And what perspective there might be for pricing of a drug like larazotide acetate into syndication? Robert Repella We believe this is a large market opportunity, potentially over 2 million patients in the U.S. That provides an excellent revenue opportunity for us and meeting an unmet need in the marketplace. It\'s too early to comment on pricing at this point. We\'ll do our sensitivity analysis as we conduct our market research assessment as we move forward but we remain excited about the possibility of meeting the needs of these patients who to date really don\'t have any solutions for the challenge that they face. Operator We\'ll go next to Greg Gilbert with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Gregory Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch How would you characterize the pace of the NUVIGIL cases versus the generics? And what are some relevant milestones you can point to over the next 12 months or so on that front? Gerald Pappert The pace discovery is proceeding with respect to the cases against each of the defendant. There is no trial date that has yet been set by the District Court in Delaware. So there is not a specific trial date I can point you to. The only other relevant probably timeline for your interest would be the expiration of the respective 30-month stays as to each defendant which begins in third week in April roughly and then continue into May and June. Gregory Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch A bigger picture question for Kevin, I think some folks have already touched on this, but Cephalon\'s clearly done a good job in finding and launching drugs in the past but I sense that there\'s a lot of skepticism among investors as to whether Cephalon is the right company to find and develop these more novel, more biotechie products. So short of fast forwarding to the clinical data readouts for all these novel programs, how do you try to make investors comfortable that you\'ll pursue a balanced approach between the novel development investments versus -- and I know the risk varies across those, but you know what I mean in broad terms, and bouncing those with sort of less risky capital deployment strategies. J. Buchi I think if you look back at history of Cephalon, our largest product, PROVIGIL, was certainly in the category of a risky investment by the time we made it. Phase I and new therapeutic area has no currently available therapy and our history as an organization has been to balance those types of opportunities with the affects which was already approved when we acquired it. I think the strategy is largely unchanged. I think we\'ve got a balanced approach, we continued to do transactions like the Mepha transaction, which was a transaction of raw products into our portfolio for the European market, we\'d be very suitable for that market. And against that, we balance things like [indiscernible], which obviously has a technology which is more risky. I think the way we get comfortable with the risk, and I don\'t know if this helps investors at all is that if you put aside the nature of the technology and look at the nature of the clinical data that supports these acquisitions, all of these product candidates forget how they work. They all have human Phase II clinical data with placebo-controlled studies that is officially and internally consistent if you would feel compelled to say these products are doing something in these patients. That\'s how we get comfortable with it internally. Hopefully as we tell that story to investors, obviously they\'re going to be some people more skeptical than others. As we tell that story, hopefully people start to believe and hopefully as the data starts to roll in for the Phase III studies, as I said, that will cement that belief. Operator And we\'ll go next to David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray. David Amsellem - Piper Jaffray Companies Just wanted to touch on the hydrocodone product. Right now you\'d be the second hydrocodone product without APAP to get to market after the Zogenix product. So I guess the question here is can you comment on how you think you are differentiated on that product? J. Buchi I\'ll make a couple of comments. First of all I\'m not sure that we\'ll be second to market behind Zogenix. I would imagine being in a race with them, but I think we\'re enrolling rapidly and I think we have a real good shot at being to market ahead of them.  Having said that, their product is my understanding, does indeed lack APAP but I don\'t believe it has any kind of deterrent properties and I don\'t believe it\'s an extended-release or I could be wrong there. So I think we\'ll be right there with them, but I think we\'ll have a much better product when it comes to market. IS that fair, Bob? Gerald Pappert The big differentiation point would be the tamper-deterrent. So APAP-free and long acting will probably be the points of similarity and but the TD is really important to the marketplace, and we think we\'ll be at the point at which we kind of diverge. David Amsellem - Piper Jaffray Companies And then the second question, back to business development, I guess the Mepha acquisition was unique in the sense that it was the departure from a lot of the pipeline-oriented transactions that you\'re doing. So I guess the question here is what\'s your appetite for doing more deals along the lines of brand generics or even vanilla generics going forward whether it\'s oversees or domestic? J. Buchi I don\'t think you\'ll see us do a generic deal in the United States. I think we do transactions that we believe are appropriate for the local market. And I think in many parts of Europe and the developing world, a brand of generic strategy can make a lot of sense. I don\'t just say it\'s not unique. We did a transaction, as you probably recall, several years before which was also the fact of the European market for the oncology space. My view of the U.S. generic marketplace is that the U.S. market doesn\'t pay for quality in generics, it just pays for the cheapest possible generic. That is in stark contrast to many other parts of the world where the quality of the product and the quality of the brand counts. So I think additional brands of generics types of deals in other parts of the world where that makes sense potentially we\'ll certainly look at those. But I wouldn\'t count on us doing a generic deal in the U.S. Operator And we\'ll go next to Marc Goodman with UBS. Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank First of all can you talk about the SG&A level in the quarter and what you spent on and whether you strategically were going to spend that at the beginning of the quarter or did you spend more as you saw that the top line was going to be better as the quarter progressed? Wilco Groenhuysen No we can\'t let our spending be determined by the trends that we see in our top line, yearly observations. Increase in SG&A has been slightly variable in nature. Largely driven by marketing initiatives such as the European launch of some of this is related to product launches and are largely variable, more focused on managing fixed cost and increasing operating leverage in 2012. Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank Just so I understand the delta from maybe an average of second and third quarter to the fourth quarter. You were saying there was launches in Europe that cost extra spending and then what else? Wilco Groenhuysen We have continued spent in NUVIGIL in the past we\'ve spoken about our WebMD campaign. We spent some money on that as you know we did a couple of transactions in the latter part in most of the increase in the third quarter of 2010 in our prepared remarks. Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank Can you talk about the WebMD campaign and what you\'re seen so far? J. Buchi Maybe Bob can say a few things about how that\'s progressing? Lesley Russell It\'s a core platform for us in terms of our Internet efforts to communicate with potential patients. We\'ve seen significant interest in terms of the number of visitors to the site that is educational in nature around shift work disorder and treated OSA and the number of patients that have followed on to gain information about NUVIGIL and potentially have a discussion with their healthcare provider about NUVIGIL and whether it\'s appropriate for them in terms of managing the excessive sleepiness associated with their shift work disorder or their treated OSA. So we\'re seeing good responsiveness and now we\'re at a point where we can start to evaluate how that responsiveness translates into discussions with the healthcare provider and then eventually a NUVIGIL prescription for appropriate patients. So I think as we get later into this quarter and into the second quarter, we\'ll have a much better view of the impact to that program. But again, it\'s part of our overall effort to leave no stone unturned in terms of consumers, patients, healthcare professionals, payers, managed care to ensure that we do everything to drive appropriate growth of NUVIGIL. Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank Can you talk about when the strategy changed from not switching patients from PROVIGIL to NUVIGIL to just focusing on the new patients? Robert Repella So we started the transition, I would say late summer in the third quarter. And have fully executed that change in the fourth quarter of last year and we talked a little bit about it on the last call, in terms of that transition being driven by the fact that in terms of PROVIGIL patients that are in our reach, we think we\'ve gotten the majority of those in terms of transition of patients that are on appropriate indications. Those that are on doses that we can move from PROVIGIL to NUVIGIL. And so with the opportunity that exists for expansion and where we were with the original conversion effort we thought that the time is right to make the transition. So late third quarter into the fourth quarter and now our focus in 2011 is growth through expansion. So we\'ve had nice results so far, we crossed over in the fourth quarter the 1 million prescription line in total since the launch of NUVIGIL. So that was a nice milestone for the brand and again, we think with the new data that we have from our Phase IV study, positions us well for sustained growth. Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank When I look at PROVIGIL plus NUVIGIL together as one franchise it still looks to me like it\'s declining. August, September, October, November, December. Why is that? Robert Repella If you look at the category in the latter part of 2010, we saw some stabilization compared to what we had seen previously and we talked a little bit about PROVIGIL\'s demonstrating a bit more strength that we had anticipated and the impact that, that had on our overall company performance. So while the category was declining consistently through the middle of 2010, again in the back half, we saw that decline slow down a bit and for the market as, we look at it, 2011, we expect it to be stable to slightly down, but not on the order of magnitude that we\'ve seen in previous years when you\'re looking at \'09 versus \'08, for example. Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank So by the end of the year you switched over a little bit more than 50% like you said, and then you\'re assuming that NUVIGIL will grow in 2012. J. Buchi The only thing to remember about 2010 is that there was really no new data for any of these products. We do have the advantage that we have some good data now [indiscernible] talked about. And hopefully, that new data will allow us to improve the penetration of NUVIGIL and continue to grow the brand. Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank What are your thoughts on the emerging markets and maybe doing some deals there? Obviously all the pharma industry is moving there. What are your thoughts? I know you have a small operation there so far. J. Buchi Yes, we do. My hope is that studies with a number of our branded products in that region, in China specifically. As we talked historically, we would very much like to do a focus transaction to get commercial presence in China. Assets in China tend to go at pretty fancy prices right now and as you know, we\'ve always been kind of value buyers. I think if we cannot find something which looks attractive commercially to us, then we will build our own infrastructure slowly over time and commercialize our products as we go forward starting with PROVIGIL at the end of this year. Operator And we\'ll go next to Nick Bishop shop with Cowen and Co. Nick Bishop We discussed a lot about your acquisition strategy. I guess you haven\'t specifically commented on whether you\'d be looking to buy somebody -- buy a company with some revenues or earnings ahead of the PROVIGIL expiration. J. Buchi In a vacuum, would we like to buy a company that has a good revenue for a fair price, sure. We don\'t see a lot of assets to kind of fit that category. Assets that are suitable for specialty marketing efforts that has some reasonable potential for growth that had long ideas with a fair price. But we\'ll always open to look for those kinds of things. It\'s a pretty scared landscape for those types of assets. Nick Bishop I was wondering do you have any updates on what might be happening -- the litigation with Watson around Fentora. Can we expect to see something on that soon? Gerald Pappert This is Gerry Pappert. As you may know, the court entered an order the other day, asking the parties for their thoughts on the practical implications of the court\'s ruling at least initially on some but not all of the patents that issue in this case. And recall there are three patents, and two of them are listed in the Orange book, one of them is not. The court\'s order indicated that the judge may be prepared to rule on the patents listed in the Orange book but not yet prepared to rule on the non-orange book. They\'ve asked the parties to provide the court with our views on the practical implications of approaching it in that fashion if you will. So we will be doing that and supplying the court with our two-page letter briefs by Tuesday the 15th which is the deadline in the order. And I don\'t think it\'s unreasonable to expect the ruling on the Orange book patents in fairly due course after their submission. Operator And we have time for one more questioner. We\'ll go next to David Buck with Buckingham Research Group. David Buck - Buckingham Research First, can you just review the price increase activity that we saw in the fourth quarter or any activity first quarter? Secondly, if you look at the R&D number that went up this year for the Mesoblast partnership, can you talk a little bit about what the Delta might be in 2012 from 2011? And just in regard to the Revascor study, how expensive would you expect that to be? And then another one for Kevin, you heard actually the comment about the riskiness of R&D strategy and the riskiness of the profile. One commercial question related to SG&A is when you see provision go in April in 2011 -- April in 2012, why wouldn\'t the recent flexing of spending on SG&A if NUVIGIL sort of peeks, and you have NUVIGIL no longer growing. J. Buchi That maybe some level of questioning. Depending upon the outlook depending upon the result of the bipolar studies. Depending upon the kind of a lot of things. I don\'t want to kid anyone that we don\'t think seriously the fact that we\'re losing a product that today is $70 billion. So we\'re not going to go to the certain the important for the branded sales, authorized generic Europe and so on. You should expect a significant decrease in revenue in 2012 beginning at 2013. We would expect to start cutting back after that as some of these new opportunities start to get launched and start to get some traction. There maybe some room to flex SG&A somewhat but my earlier point as you\'re well aware there is no one out there currently detailing PROVIGIL today. On the R&D side, it\'s difficult to predict what the R&D line is going to look like because we have multiple phase three trials going on now, which will be continuing into 2012. Some will be concluding this year, but many will be concluding in 2012 and a number starting up in 2012. So the R&D spend really depends on the success rate that we have. I have a much better feel for that as we go through this year. Your other question, I think I was going to turn over it over to Bob and I forgot what it was anyway. David Buck - Buckingham Research Price increase activity and maybe just a thought on formulary for NUVIGIL in 2012 J. Buchi I\'ll take the crash question and then Bob can take your question on formulary. A total of 2010 price by 10% and lower price also by 10% and mid-January by about 5% and PROVIGIL prices by about 10%. Robert Repella Dave, what was your formulary question? We lost that one. David Buck - Buckingham Research As you look towards April 2012, can you give some sense of what you think the formulary position for NUVIGIL would be? Robert Repella We have long-term agreements in place with the majority of our customers in terms of access reimbursement and formulary position. We think that combined with the possibility of new indications like bipolar will have our customers look to the value, the increasing value that NUVIGIL can provide going forward. We also, when we look at the market, we recognize that and we talk to customers that therapeutic interventions, they\'re costly, they\'re time consuming they take a lot of energy. And we don\'t expect with the agreements we have in place that customers are going to want to move in that direction. So we expect a prescription written for NUVIGIL in 2012 and beyond will get filled with NUVIGIL, again because the agreements we have in place and the value the product provides. And when you look at the category, relatively speaking, it is not that large with these customers so again, we don\'t expect them to be that interested in taking specific action. They\'ll realize their windfall, their economic gain when medafinil goes generic. But we think we\'ll have a long-term relationship with them as it relates to NUVIGIL.

(Operator Instructions).  I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Mardi Dier.  Ma'am, you may begin your conference. Mardi Dier, Investor Relations Good afternoon and welcome to Chiron's fourth quarter 2005 conference call.  I am Mardi Dier from Investor Relations.  On behalf of the Chiron team I would like to introduce you to our principal speakers on today's call, Howard Pien, our CEO, David Smith, our CFO.  And joining us for the Q&A on today’s call are, Jack Goldstein, our President and COO, Gene Walker, President of Chiron Blood Testing, Dan Soland, President of Chiron Vaccines, Craig Wheeler, President of BioPharmaceuticals, and Stephen Dilly, our Senior Vice President of BioPharmaceuticals Development. Before we begin, let me remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, including statements related to product development, Chiron’s manufacturing capacity and expectations for 2006.  These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied herein.  We refer you to the documents that the Company has filed with the SEC, including our 2004 10-K, our third quarter 10-Q, and our upcoming 10-K for 2005, as well as our fourth quarter earnings release that we issued earlier today for a discussion of factors that could cause the Company's actual performance to differ from those expressed or implied in today's remarks. Such factors include the outcome of clinical trials, and regulatory review, competition, and manufacturing issues.  Chiron does not undertake an obligation to update the forward-looking information we're providing today.  2005 financial results included in today's press release are preliminary, and quarterly information is unaudited. Please note that we present our financial results on both an as reported or GAAP, and an adjusted basis where we indicate a number to be adjusted in today's discussion or otherwise refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we have posted a reconciliation of such numbers to GAAP on our website in the Investor section under Financial Reports.  In addition, a reconciliation of certain adjusted numbers to GAAP is attached to the fourth quarter earnings release.  Thank you, and now I will turn it over to Howard. Howard Pien, Chief Executive Officer 2005 has been an eventful one for Chiron, a year in which we saw the incredible drive and fortitude of our employees and their dedication to create value.  Today I would like to talk about the progress we made in 2005, and how we finished the year a much stronger Company.  For three years now we have provided a scoreboard at the beginning of the year against which we measure our performance at the end of the year.  While we missed our financial milestones in 2005, principally because we did not achieve our target with FLUVIRIN, we are pleased with our achievements in the past year, particularly our return to the U.S. flu vaccine market, along with the progress of our oncology pipeline, and the continued uptick of ULTRIO, especially outside of the U.S. In some cases in each one of our businesses we performed beyond our initial goals and expectations.  For example, in Blood Testing the FDA approved the PROCLEIX West Nile Virus assay in December, sooner than we expected.  For example, in Vaccines we made significant strides with our influenza pandemic planning.  We were awarded a stockpile contract for H5N1 in the U.S. And in addition, data from an NIH study confirmed that our MF59 adjuvant can elicit increased immunogenicity, which it's a critical factor in enhancing vaccines supplies in the event of a pandemic. And for example in BioPharma the independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended the continuation of our CAPTIVATE study, an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial with Tifacogin for the treatment of patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia.  But to be complete, we did miss the timing of the meningitis vaccine phase movements and the patient enrollment number for Tifacogin, both of which are now goals for 2006.  And we did not achieve the FDA approval for PULMINIQ, we merely got an approvable letter. Overall, given the tremendous efforts that the entire Company put into FLUVIRIN remediation, we are proud of what we achieved in 2005, and that we have continued to work hard to fulfill our commitment to public health, and of course to value creation.  And financially, notwithstanding the enormous challenges associated with the FLUVIRIN remediation mobilization, we finished very strong.  We saw growth across all three businesses in 2005, with product sales increasing 12% and revenue growing 11% compared to 2004.  Let me now discuss our performance with a bit more detail starting with the Vaccines business. While we fell short of the original target of FLUVIRIN doses this year we overcame numerous obstacles and met enormous challenges to return FLUVIRIN to the U.S. And with what amounted to be approximately one-third of the manufacturing working days devoted to production because we had to devote the rest to remediation and regulatory approval of the Liverpool facility, we sold approximately 15 million doses of FLUVIRIN by the end of the year.  And with a full season of manufacturing ahead of us for the '06/'07 season, we project that we will have the capacity for approximately 40 million doses of FLUVIRIN, as we expect to be on a normal schedule with all of the benefits of this season, this past season's remediation.  Of course, the ultimate delivery quantity is subject to yields, throughput, the length of the production season, and other risks associated with influenza vaccine manufacturing.  We will be in a better position to estimate production after we start manufacturing actually. On the commercial front we continue to be confident about pricing and distribution.  We see numerous indications that pricing will remain firm beyond this flu season because of the clearer than ever public health policy imperative to increase vaccination levels, because of the reimbursement rates, and because of Chiron's multi-year arrangements with our distributors.  2005 was a rebuilding year for us.  And going into 2006 we're confident that we will be a major participant in this growing market segment.  FLUVIRIN remains an important driver for our Company, but it is just one part.  Chiron is well positioned to help address the nation's pandemic preparedness.  Chiron's heritage with avian flu goes back to 1997.  And with this heritage and now with our FDA approved manufacturing facility at Liverpool restored, we were awarded one of the contracts by the U.S. government to provide stockpile of H5N1 pandemic vaccine.  And in addition to the U.S., other countries also have expressed interest in our pandemic flu vaccine capabilities.  We are in advanced discussions with several European countries about similar stockpiling initiatives on their part. The NIH has a program to study our H5N1 vaccine candidates with adjutants.  Data, we early reported data from an earlier NIH study with our candidate for another avian flu vaccine, H9N2, with our proprietary adjuvant, MF59, proved very encouraging.  The H9N2 vaccine candidate was shown to be immunogenic at just 3.75 micrograms, which will be one-quarter the normal amount of the antigen used in the vaccine.  In addition our research has shown that MF59 may elicit cross protection against drifted strains of H5N1.  MF59 could enhance the strength and the breadth of the response of an avian flu vaccine, therefore reducing the required amount of antigen, the concept of so-called stairing.  We are very, very close to establishing a regulatory pathway for an adjuvanted pandemic flu vaccine in 2006. The long-term solution to a pandemic probably lies with cell culture, the next generation technology for making flu vaccine.  Cell culture-based production is potentially a key aspect of the long-term solution to a pandemic threat because of improved manufacturing flexibility and shorter lead times.  In Europe we're completing our Phase 3 program for our flu cell culture vaccine candidate, which we plan to file for approval in 2006.  In the U.S. we have completed patient enrollment in our Phase 1/2 trial.  And pending discussions with the FDA, we expect to initiate a Phase 3 trial at the start of the coming flu season. Moving beyond flu vaccines, progress in our meningococcal vaccine franchise is exciting, both with our later stage MenACWY candidate and our groundbreaking genomics-based MenB candidate.  We are concluding our Phase 2 program, including a study in infants, with our ACWY candidate.  While the final data reports have yet to be completed, we have seen good immunogenicity and safety in infants.  As I mentioned, we expect to initiate a Phase 3 program in 2006.  There is currently no broad coverage MenB vaccine.  We have completed the Phase 1 trial in Chiron's candidate, and anticipate initiating a Phase 2 trial in 2006. Turning now to the BioPharma business.  Last week the European regulatory authority granted marketing approval to CUBICIN for complicated skin and soft tissue infection.  And CUBICIN, licensed from our partner, Cubist, is an important antibiotic for addressing the ever-increasing prevalence of MRSA.  We plan to launch this product in the UK and in the Netherlands imminently, and in other European countries to follow. Now that we have received final approval for this first claim complicated skin and soft tissue infection, we plan to submit a supplemental approval for the next label claim based on the endocarditis and bacteremia data from Cubist's recent trial.  Tifacogin represents a significant market opportunity for Chiron.  Last month the independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended the continuation of the CAPTIVATE trial, the Phase 3 mortality study of Tifacogin in severe community-acquired pneumonia.  The data remain blinded to Chiron until the trial completes.  We aim to complete a study and file for approval in the course of 2007, and hope that this product will address the unmet need for patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia, which in the U.S. causes 300,000 hospitalizations annually and with a mortality rate of up to 30%. We and our partner Nektar continue to progress with tobramycin inhalation powder, or TIP, which will be the logical extension to our success with TOBI.  TIP utilizes a handheld device designed to reduce administration time and increase convenience.  We have begun the first of two Phase 3 trials for TIP and plan to start a second trial soon.  Our early stage oncology pipeline is exciting.  Our focused research and development approach over the last two years has resulted in robust compounds that include multiple Phase 1 trials.  We currently have three solid candidates in development.  We're progressing with the so-called disease specific part of the Phase 1 program with CHIR-258, our highly selective multi-targeted kinanse inhibitor.  We look to start our Phase 2 program probably around the end this year. CHIR-12.12 is our fully humanized anti-CD-40 monoclonal antibody being developed in collaboration with our partner XOMA.  We are enrolling patients in two Phase 1 trials in both CLL and multiple myeloma.  We are very excited about the compound called CHIR-265, our oral RAF kinase inhibitor.  The IND for CHIR-265 was accepted, and we will be initiating a Phase 1 trial shortly.  Together we believe that these candidates provide the evidence that our approach in the last two years has led Chiron to one of the most compelling early-stage oncology pipelines in the industry. Now moving to Blood Testing.  Our Blood Testing business has been a strong driver of growth over the last four years, and continues to meet our milestones.  Last month we received FDA approval for the PROCLEIX West Nile Virus Assay, which allows us now to move from the cost recovery arrangement to launch of our commercial product over the next few months.  The FDA continues to review the U.S. application for Ultrio, which adds a hep B test to the HIV and a hep C test.  An uptake of Ultrio in the EU where it was CE marked since 2004 has been very strong.  We have converted more than 60% of our ex U.S. customers to ULTRIO.  We reached our goal of entering four new countries in 2005, notably South Africa.  We have set a similar goal for ourselves in the course of 2006. Further instrumentation growth will come with U.S. approval of TIGRIS, which is the fully automated high throughput system.  We anticipate filing the TIGRIS West Nile Virus 510(k) by midyear.  We have already placed 40 units worldwide, and are pleased that our customers have expressed their satisfaction with this system.  I know that all of you are aware of the definitive merger agreement with Novartis, under which Novartis would acquire all of the shares of Chiron that it does not currently own.  Since the proxy has not yet been finalized, we will not been answering questions beyond this brief update.  Last month the FTC completed its review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino provisions.  And last week the Committee on Foreign Investment concluded its so-called XON florial review and determined that there are no issues of national security sufficient to warrant an investigation on this transaction. Now, other than the Security and Exchange clearance, all U.S. regulatory reviews for the proposed merger have been completed.  The merger agreement remains subject to the approval of the Chiron shareholders, the European regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions.  Assuming the Securities and Exchange Commission completes their review of the draft proxy in the next couple of weeks, Chiron and Novartis expect that a shareholders’ vote can occur sometime in March.  The proxy statement will contain detailed information with respect to the transaction, and we urge all shareholders to consider this information carefully.  And keep in mind the independent Directors of Chiron voted unanimously in favor of this merger.  And we believe that the transaction recognizes the progress we have shown in the past year and fairly values Chiron's opportunities. Let me now turn the call over to David for a detailed discussion of the financials of 2005. David Smith, Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Howard.  I will begin with a review of the results for both the quarter and the full year, which were released earlier today.  All earnings per share amounts that I will be discussing today refer to the adjusted diluted per share earnings, unless otherwise noted.  As we have discussed previously, we present our financial result on both an as reported or GAAP basis, and an adjusted basis.  The adjustments we made this year to arrive at adjusted earnings consist of the amortization expense on acquired identifiable intangible assets related to acquisitions, and certain impairment losses on acquired intangibles.  The adjustments in 2004 consisted of the amortization expense on acquired identifiable intangible assets and purchased in-process research and development related to acquisitions and discontinued operations.  A reconciliation between our GAAP and adjusted results can be found on our website in the Investor Section under Financial Reports. For the year, Chiron reported adjusted income from continuing operations of 259 million or $1.34 per share as compared to adjusted earnings per share of $0.67 in 2004.  Three factors had a significant impact on the yearly comparison of financial results, and best explain the significant fluctuations when comparing 2005 and 2004.  First in 2005, Chiron recognized 96 million of FLUVIRIN revenue with the return of FLUVIRIN to the U.S. market.  We recognized no FLUVIRIN revenue for the 2004/2005 influenza season following the suspension of our license in our Liverpool facility.  In addition, our entire FLUVIRIN product was written off in 2004. Second, there were no sales of BEGRIVAC influenza vaccine in 2005.  And third, our effective tax rate declined during the year to an atypical 11% compared to 25% on an adjusted basis in 2004, primarily a result of lower profits in certain ex U.S. locations and the transfer of certain product rights in 2004.  For the fourth quarter, Chiron reported adjusted income from continuing operations of $0.81 per share.  Total revenues for 2005 increased 11% to 1.9 billion from 1.7 billion for 2004. Product sales increased 12% to 1.4 billion, largely due to the successful return of FLUVIRIN to the U.S. market.  In addition, increases in sales were seen in Travel Vaccines, PROCLEIX products, TOBI, Meningococcal Vaccines, and BETASERON.  Royalty and license fee revenues were up, primarily due to various settlements in 2005.  In addition, there was an increase in BETAFERON royalties and royalties from Roche.  Gross profit margins increased to 49% from last year's gross margins of 47%.  The return of FLUVIRIN to the U.S. market positively impacted margins in 2005.  However, FLUVIRIN remediation costs, the loss of BEGRIVAC sales, and inventory write-offs had a negative impact on our 2005 margins. Research and development expenses for 2005 totaled 434 million, essentially in line with 2004.  Research and development expenses were primarily driven by the development efforts in our oncology and meningococcal franchises and for tifacogin, and flu cell culture.  SG&A expenses for 2005 totaled 502 million, up 9% from 2004.  The increase in SG&A reflects a broad range of activities, significant among them Novartis transaction related costs, the prelaunch program for CUBICIN in Europe, higher employee related costs, compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and higher FLUVIRIN vaccine related legal costs.  For reasons we have just stated, our full year effective tax rate declined to 11% in 2005.  We do not consider this tax rate to be indicative of the Company's effective tax rate going forward. Now I would like to move on to a review of the business unit financial results, starting with our Blood Testing unit.  Blood Testing total revenues, including product sales, Chiron's share of the revenues from our joint business arrangement with Ortho, collaborative agreement revenues, and royalties and licenses fees increased to 556 million in 2005 from 494 million in 2004, a 12% increase.  This increase was primarily due to higher sales of PROCLEIX products over a year ago, increased revenue from the joint business arrangement, and higher royalty and license fees.  Driving the PROCLEIX growth of 9% was continued penetration into several markets abroad, and the continued success of our ULTRIO assay and TIGRIS systems outside of the United States. Revenue from the joint business arrangement were up 16%, primarily due to higher profitability.  Also contributing to the increase was higher royalty revenue, up 19% primarily due to payments received from Roche in 2005, reflecting higher royalty rates as certain countries enter the EU, increases in reported Roche donations, and various licensing agreements and settlements. Turning now to Vaccines.  In 2005 total product sales for the vaccines business were 582 million versus 479 million in 2004.  Sales of FLUVIRIN Vaccine were 96 million in 2005.  There were no sales of FLUVIRIN vaccines in 2004 for the '04/'05 seasons.  Sales of our other flu vaccines, excluding FLUVIRIN, were 129 million in 2005, down 15% from 2004.  The loss of sales of our BEGRIVAC product drove the decrease, and was partially offset by increases in sales of other influenza vaccines in 2005.  2005 Meningococcal vaccines sales were 43 million, up 56% from 2004.  This increase was primarily driven by increased sales of MenB to the Ministry of Health in New Zealand, and an increase in tender sales of MENJUGATE. Sales of our Travel Vaccines were 148 million in 2005, up 52% from 2004.  Our ENCEPUR vaccine and rabies vaccines drove the increase.  The increase in ENCEPUR was driven by our overall market growth, and a number of marketing initiatives that increased our market share.  In addition, 2004 ENCEPUR sales were lower than 2005 due to sales in the fourth quarter of 2003.  So with increased demand for our rabies Vaccines in the United States, primarily due to a product recall from a competitor, as well as a price increase.  In addition, there was an increase in tender sales for rabies vaccine in Europe and Asia. Sales of pediatric and other vaccines were 166 million in 2005, down 17% from 2004, primarily due to a decline in sales of our polio and MMR vaccines due to lack of product availability as a result of manufacturing upgrades.  In addition, there was a decrease in other vaccines from the interruption of production of certain vaccines in our Liverpool plant to focus on our remediation efforts.  These decreases were partial offset by increased sales of our DtP vaccine to GSK. Gross profit for Vaccines increased to 32% from last year's gross margin of 23%.  The return of FLUVIRIN to the United States market positively impacted Vaccine's margins in 2005.  In addition, there was a $91 million write-off of FLUVIRIN inventory in 2004.  However, FLUVIRIN remediation costs in 2005 and the loss of BEGRIVAC sales, and inventory write-offs had a negative impact on our 2005 margins.  In addition, the decline in sales of our polio and MMR Vaccines also negatively impacted our 2005 margins. Moving to our third business, BioPharmaceuticals.  Total BioPharmaceuticals product revenues were 536 million in 2005, up from 512 million in 2004, a 5% increase.  We saw increases in TOBI and BETASERON sales, while PROLEUKIN sales declined.  Our TOBI sales were 233 million, up 9% from 2004, primarily due to price increases and increased patient demand in both the United States and Europe, partially offset by wholesaler ordering patterns. Our PROLEUKIN sales were 124 million, down 5% from 2004, primarily due to a decrease in patient demand as a result of increased clinical trial activity of third-party compounds, partially offset by price increases.  Our sales of BETASERON were 142 million, up 9% from 2004.  This increase was primarily driven by price increases and a shift of revenue from royalties to product sales as Schering began to sell product manufactured by us in additional European countries.  These increases were partially offset by reduced shipments to Berlex and inventory ordering patterns. BETASERON royalties were 60 million, up 16%, as a result of an increase in demand in price, partially offset by a shift in third-party production to in-house production.  Gross margins in the BioPharmaceuticals segment were 72%, consistent with 2004.  Let me take a minute to summarize our view of the year.  We achieved solid product sales and revenue this year, and have returned to the U.S. market with FLUVIRIN, clearing the many regulatory hurdles we faced.  We're proud of this achievement, and see this as a critical step to furthering our strong position in influenza vaccines, which includes our work on pandemic preparedness and the advances in our flu cell culture development program.  We now look forward to manufacturing for an entire season in 2006.  In addition, we continue to advance our oncology pipeline with the exciting work we have done with CHIR-258, CHIR-12.12, and our newest molecule, CHIR-265. 2006 will bring the initiation of our MenACWY Phase 3, and bring us that much closer to fully enrolling our tifacogin Phase 3 clinical trial.  We have seen solid progress on our development and commercial goals in BioPharma, Blood Testing and Vaccines, All highlighting the prospects for growth and value creation that we see for Chiron. At this point I will turn the call back over to Marti for Q&A. Mardi Dier, Investor Relations And now we will open up the call for questions.  Just a quick reminder of what Howard said that we will not be taking questions regarding the pending merger with Novartis, but all other questions are welcome.  Thank you. Questions-and-Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions).  Our next question comes from the line of May-Kin Ho. Q - May-Kin Ho Can you discuss the significant increase in royalties? What was involved in terms of the settlement? That is number one.  And Number two on the.…… A - David Smith We pointed out earlier in the year a settlement with the Scottish Blood Service, that happened, I believe, in the second quarter.  And then we also had a recent fourth quarter settlement with Centocor over a patent dispute.  Those are the…… Q - May-Kin Ho What was the patent? A - David Smith We're not disclosing what that was. Q - May-Kin Ho And then on the tax rate, did something happen that you did not foresee in the fourth quarter? Because it is so different then what we thought it would it be for the entire year? A - David Smith Obviously we have been looking at this for the year, but we did have impacts in the fourth quarter, again, as we looked at the profitability of some of our ex U.S. entities and all that came down lower in the fourth quarter and therefore on an annual basis, which drove the tax rate down significantly, as it were.  There are a number of other little ins and outs.  I mean, we have a global footprint which has allowed us to present several tax planning structures and opportunities for us.  This is in a case where everything went one direction this year, and we did not have anything in the way of tax structuring, which would have driven up expenses related to allow for preferable rates in the future. Q - May-Kin Ho Lastly, on the flu vaccine with MF59, what do you expect to happen in terms of the regulatory pathway? Because I guess it was mentioned that you expect to have a pathway established this year? A - Howard Pien We expect to have a discussion with the agency in the not very distant future once we provide all of the documentation on what we think are the data with MF59, because we have a fairly substantial safety database of MF59 in conjunction with a flu vaccine that we used for Europe.  So we're putting the data together.  And in conjunction with all of the recent analysis and data that have begun to show that those sterling characteristic of MF59.  And we want to present a proposal to the agency as to how there can be a way for the adjuvanted FLUVIRIN, if you will, but it is not a FLUVIRIN of course to be approved.  And then we hope to get a guidance from the agency on how to proceed. Q - May-Kin Ho If there is a pathway would it be approved in time for '06/'07? A - Howard Pien I think it is too early to tell.  We really would like to have the meeting and, with the agency, and if we have something concrete to discuss and disclose, of course we will. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Wei. Q - Thomas Wei I had a question on the PROCLEIX and Blood Testing line.  If I go back through the original guidance that you had given for that, which you reiterated as recently as July, you were looking for a midteens year-over-year increase in that line item, and it ended up at 9% instead.  Can you help us understand what the disconnect was? What happened between July and January to cause that sort of shortfall in your PROCLEIX projection? A - Gene Walther This is Gene.  I think the main contributor was probably a combination of over optimism and longer close cycles than what we had anticipated.  A lot of it was really just timing related.  When you look at the target customers that we had identified for 2005, we virtually were able to close of those customers.  It just took us a little longer to be able to get there than what we had expected, and what we were thinking back in the middle of the year. As we mentioned, we have achieved the conversion on ULTRIO that we had expected with greater than 60% of our ex U.S. customers converting.  It is just that it took us a little longer to get there then what we had anticipated.  I think the other encouraging thing is two things.  One our Q4 2005 over Q4 2004 was over 13%.  And I think that is more indicative of what we had expected, and reinforces the timing delay that we experienced.  As well as if you look at the growth that we saw outside of the U.S., both in the European sector in the Asia-Pacific sector.  Both of those grew at greater than 30% last year.  It was really driven more by timing I think that contributed to that than anything else. Q - Thomas Wei Just a follow-up.  As long as we are on the fourth quarter of '05 in the PROCLEIX point, I guess you missed the Street consenus and my estimate there.  I think we all had been expecting a little bit more acceleration given the qualitative commentary like South Africa coming online at the beginning of the fourth quarter.  Did we miss something there, because the growth looks very similar from Q2 to 3Q to 4Q? A - Gene Walther I think the, again, growth there was in part the function of timing, and I think as we talked last year, it was also a function of seasonality.  You get a decrease typically due to the holidays in the November/December time frame, which makes it a little difficult to see that substantial growth.  But I think if you look at quarter over quarter from prior year, it is more indicative of the growth that we expect to see in 2006. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Quentin Lai. Q - Quentin Lai Thanks for taking my call.  Following a little bit on Thomas' question here.  With respect to the West Nile Virus you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're preparing to go to commercial pricing in a few months.  How long does that take? Is it one of those situations where the current inventory is still at research pricing? A - Gene Walther It is not so much inventory driven as it is by a number of factors.  First of all, per our agreements with our customers we have roughly, we give them roughly 90 days to transition from cost recovery pricing to the commercial pricing.  Additionally, there are a number of components that we have to put in place, some additional software, new SOPs that they have to write, etc.  And all of that takes time.  So we're in the process actively right now with each of our customers and converting them over to the IVD environment.  And commensurate with that we will do the commercial pricing.  We're in discussions and have been for probably the last 30 to 45 days with our customers in contract negotiation.  And we expect that those will be completed within the next couple of weeks.  And certainly that we will be in a commercial pricing environment before the mosquito season here in North America. Q - Quentin Lai With respect to FLUVIRIN, have you shipped all 13 million, or is there still some extra lots or extra doses that could be shipped here in this quarter? And then as we look out into this full production season, any chance you could make a stab at what you think your gross margins could be for the Vaccine's business? A - Howard Pien This includes it, right? Q - Quentin Lai Yes. A - Howard Pien The total number of doses that we produce and cleared for the '05 season was a little short of 15 million.  But the last batches came out late for the reason that we discussed, that it has taken time for us to finish up all the activities, so we delivered those products.  And clear late, so the last million and a half doses we simply were not able to deliver to our customers in time, by the end of 2005.  So we still have 1.5 million doses lying around.  But it is unlikely that it would result in any revenue recognition, because pretty much with clinics and physician's offices vaccination season is over.  And if we do book any revenue over that last bit, it will not be significant or meaningful in the first quarter of 2006.  We're not ready to give guidance on FLUVIRIN production quantity for 2006.  We have probably indicated from our experience in 2005, and the amount of effective calculated manufacturing dates that we in 2005 that we are, we believe that a capacity is 20 million doses.  But there is a difference between capacity and ultimate delivery, and you have heard this again and again.  So I think it is the right time for us to be able to talk more meaningfully about a more concrete projection for 2006 will be when we have the seeds in hand, we have, we know what our new strains are for the 2006.  When we have taken those seeds and just find out for ourselves a little bit more about the yield.  So it is going to be where we are a bit into the actual production season that we believe it is wise and prudent for us to give a forecast for the 2006 quantity. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges. Q - Geoffrey Porges Congratulations on getting things back on track.  I don't know whether I missed it, Howard, but could you comment on what sort of premium you think the West Nile Assay now you have got commercial pricing will be at compared to the existing PROCLEIX pricing? And then secondly, another pricing question.  Could you just comment generally about realized pricing in the U.S. market for FLUVIRIN and what you see as the overall demand for this season, because it looks as though it was probably was about the same as last season in total, if I'm not mistaken.  And then finally, could you could just give us a little bit more caller on the likely indications for 265 and 258. A - Gene Walther I will take the first one on West Nile premium.  We are, as I mentioned, in the middle of negotiations, And I am sure as you can appreciate those are sensitive, nor would we want to discuss where we're going from a premium standpoint.  Clearly we have been under cost recovery and we are moving forward I think along similar lines as what we did last time when we went from d-cust cost recovery to commercial pricing.  But I think it is best not to give any more color around that at this sensitive time. A - Howard Pien The FLUVIRIN demand, we kind of address that we believe firmly in the mega trends that our physicians in clinics have better reimbursement structure.  Quite frankly that the reason why we think that 150 to 180 million people vaccination rate has been, which has been a CDC professed public health objective, has been hard to see progress only for the reason that we have had turbulence with our trouble with the supply of FLUVIRIN.  And we understand very clearly that this is has been very difficult for public health services such as the CDC and for healthcare providers.  We believe that as the confidence increases in the course of the upcoming season, especially with other companies saying that they, even in '06 or '07 will be able to supply the U.S. market with the additional doses.  I think that fortifies the will and the strength and the initiative and the energy and the amount of aggressiveness and proactiveness of the government in trying to take the current rate of 70, 80 million, up to 120, 130, 150.  I think once again it is premature for us to project what precisely will be the '06 number.  The dust is still settling a bit.  What is happening on the pandemic front where it is increasingly recognized that one good way of dealing with pandemic before all of that and programs and initiatives are put in place is simply to get people to get used to getting vaccinated during the winter pandemic season.  We're optimistic about all of the factors and the trends that we disclosed a long-term increase in the quantity with 395 or with 4.  I think Stephen, Stephen do you want to answer the question? The question…….. A - Stephen Dilly I am very happy to remind people.  The question was, what is are likely indications for CHIR-265 and CHIR-258? Really this is a two-part answer.  The first part is the initial target indications, and then where we could possibly go from there.  As you know we have been very focused in terms of our development on a translational medicine-based program.  What that means is we have been focused on indications where we can sample the treatment during treatment.  On that has led us, particularly with CHIR-258 towards the hematological malignancies.  So right now we are very excited about the potential for 258 in, for instance, AML.  We also see there being a potential then myeloma and other heden malignancies.  Beyond that though remember this has one of the more interesting antiangiogenic profiles out there, in that it is an inhibitor of CHF, SGF and PDGF.  It is our intention to do studies in Phase 2 that will actually establish that that triple approach to antiangiogenic conveys superiority to say a pure digess approach or the kind of sutent approach of two enzymes. So if those experiments come out positively, then we believe we will have one of the most powerful antiangiogenics out there.  So it has potential utility in a broad range of solid tumors.  But really the first attack will be in the heden malignancies.  Both 258 and 265, we also like melanoma as a lead indication.  Again, partly because it is very attractive also to the translational medicine approach, but also because its angenic profile of those agents points to melanoma quite cogently.  265 is really very early days to call exactly how big it is going to be.  But what we do know is we've got a very good pre-clinical profile in terms of having a real RAF antagonist that is active in the divo as opposed to just in biochemical assays.  So both of them we are very excited about their long-term potential. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Alex Hittle. Q - Alex Hittle If I may skirt just a touch close to the merger here.  I was wondering if the lower tax rate is in any way connected with preparations for the merger? And more broadly, if I might go there, are there other actions that were taken on the business side that might reflect preparations for the merger, aside from the issuance of equity to Novartis? A - Howard Pien I think we are not going to answer the questions about merger, but we will answer the question about tax rate in its own right.  But on the second part of your question, we are certainly operating our businesses in what we call business as usual fashion.  We will continue to make the right investment decisions.  We're continuing to focus and concentrate on value creation with respect to the milestone and the progress on phase movement and so on.  Although we should recognize that there is ongoing integration planning activities with colleagues from Novartis.  But we will answer the tax question, David. A - David Smith I think it is easy to answer the tax question.  It is our tax structure and our tax planning that prompted this, and Chyron's operations have prompted this that had nothing to do with this, anything related to the merger. Q - Alex Hittle Okay.  If I could jump topic here on the follow-up.  If one simply takes the revenues realized on the FLUVIRIN sales and back that into the number of doses, is that an accurate kind of measure of pricing and what you might expect in the coming year? Or do you think further price increases are likely in '06? A - David Smith It is certainly an accurate I think indication of this year.  And we have long said that we believe that pricing remains strong, or in the influence the market in the United States.  But we don't really have any comment in terms of what that might mean for next year other than we feel very good about the pricing environment. Operator (Operator Instructions).  Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Wei. Q - Thomas Wei I just want to ask a follow-up on a comment that you made about West Nile Virus commercial pricing.  Following the experience of the PROCLEIX transition, from cost recovery to commercial pricing, should we interpret that on a literal basis to mean the same sort of percentage increase or the same sort of absolute dollar increase? A - Gene Walther It was intended to mean not an absolute dollar increase. Q - Thomas Wei Perhaps that percentage increase might be a better way to think about it? A - Gene Walther That might be a better way to think about it. Operator There are no further questions at this time. Mardi Dier, Investor Relations That concludes our question-and-answer period.  I will now turn the call back over to Howard for his closing remarks. Howard Pien, Chief Executive Officer In closing, our achievements over the past year paint a picture of a Chiron has continued to strive for value creation.  And we continue to set ambitious goals for ourselves in 2006.  These we include, as it has been in the past, commercial advances regulatory submissions, and phase movements across all of our businesses.  And obviously one of our key goals is to close the merger agreement with Novartis.  We're proud of the fact that Chiron's pioneering science has saved millions of lives, and we believe many aspects of our heritage will endure.  And we thank you, our investors, for your patience as we completed one of the most challenging years in Chiron's stellar history.  Thank you very much and go Sea Hawks.

Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHRW ) Q1 2017 Earnings Call April 26, 2017 8:30 am ET Executives Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the C.H. Robinson First Quarter 2017 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following today\'s presentation, Tim Gagnon will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, April 26, 2017. I will now turn the conference over to Tim Gagnon, the Director of Investor Relations. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thank you, Donna, and good morning, everyone. On our call this morning will be John Wiehoff, Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Clarke, Chief Financial Officer. John and Andy will provide some prepared comments on the highlights of our first quarter results. We\'ll follow that with a response to the pre-submitted questions we received after our earnings release yesterday. Please note that there are presentation slides that accompany our call to facilitate our discussion. The slides can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of our website which is located at chrobinson.com. John and Andy will be referring to these slides in their prepared comments. I\'d like to remind you that comments made by John, Andy or others representing C.H. Robinson may contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management\'s expectations. Before turning it over to John, I wanted to remind investors that last quarter we started reporting our business in three reporting segments based on accumulation of changes that have occurred during recent years. Our three reportable segments are the Surface Transportation business in North America, the Global Forwarding business, which now represents over 20% of enterprise net revenues and the Robinson Fresh business. With that, I\'ll turn it over to John to begin his prepared comments on slide three with a review of our first quarter results. John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thank you, Tim. Our total revenues increased 11% in the first quarter. The revenue increase was the result of volume growth across all of our transportation services. Net revenues increased 1% in the quarter. The addition of APC Logistics accounted for approximately 2% of our total net revenue in the quarter. Net revenues were negatively impacted by margin compression across most of our transportation services, with the truckload margin compression as the largest factor. Income from operations was 188 million, a decrease of 5.5%, and net income was up 2.6%. We had diluted earnings per share of $0.86 compared to $0.83 last year. As noted on the slide, we did have a couple of discrete items that impacted the first quarter results that I want to highlight here, and Andy will cover more about them in his comments. The first relates to our adoption of a new accounting rules for income taxes. That adoption resulted in a lower effective tax rate of 31.7% for the quarter. The second item references a credit that reduced our SG&A by $8.75 million related to the positive settlement of a legal claim. Again, more a common both of those, but I wanted to highlight them as discrete of items impacting our first quarter results. Our average head count was up 7.8%, with APC accounting for approximately 2.5 percentage points of the overall head count growth. We\'ve discussed the past couple of quarters that we continue to be in a tough part of the margin cycle in the North American truckload business. We felt that might be the case in the first half of 2017 and the first quarter results are indicative of a continuation of that environment. We\'ve continued to take share across all of our services and we feel very good about our value proposition and how we\'re winning market share across all of our services and markets. With that, I\'ll turn it over to Andy to review to review results from across the businesses. Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thank you, John. I will begin my comments on slide four with the enterprise financials before moving to the reportable segments. We acknowledge it was a challenging quarter for earnings. However, I\'d like to recognize all of our people for their great efforts in delivering 13% volume growth across all of the services. This growth is well ahead of the overall market and strong indication that the hard work of our people throughout the entire company is being recognized by our customers. Onto the summarized income statement. For the first quarter operating expenses increased 4.5% to $381 million. Personnel expenses increased 4.7% in the quarter. The primary reason for the increase in personal expense was the addition of people in the three business segments and in technology as our average head count rose 7.8% in the quarter. We invested in talent to support the double-digit volume growth in the business units and additionally, we are adding to the IT team to support the execution of our technology initiatives and the continued enhancement of them Navisphere platform. Approximately 30% of the additional head count was a result of the APC acquisition, which is added nicely to our top line growth. The increase in head count cost were partially offset by our variable compensation plans where both cash and equity incentives were lower in the quarter. SG&A expenses increased 3.7% in the first quarter and were impacted by a couple of items. We had previously reported the settlement of a legal claim, which reduced SG&A by 8.75 million in this line item. That benefit was offset partially by a higher allowance for doubtful accounts of about $3.5 million, an increase in purchase services of about $4 million and approximately $3 million increase in acquisition amortization. For the quarter, our operating income as a percent of net revenue was 33.1%, a decrease of 220 basis points from last year. The effective tax rate during the quarter was 31.7% versus 37 .4% last year. The tax rate was lower as a result of the tax benefit related to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the quarter. The effect of adoption of the accounting standards update was to lower our effective taxes paid by $9.3 million. The first quarter will have the largest impact to the tax rate as a result of the way our compensation timing works. For the remaining quarters in 2017, we expect a tax rate between 36% and 37%. This rate will fluctuate based on the value of the shares, as well as a percentage of pre-tax profits generated outside the United States. Moving on to slide five and other financial information, we generated nearly $93 million in cash in the quarter, and had just under $17 million in capital expenditures. The largest driver in the decrease in cash flow from operations during the quarter was the increase in accounts receivable. This occurrence is normal during periods of accelerating top line growth as well as increases in the cost of fuel. We finished the quarter with $230 million in cash, and our debt balance remains $1.24 billion. For the year 2017, we expect total capital expenditures to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million. On to slide six, and our capital distribution to shareholders. We returned approximately 113 million share shareholders in the quarter with just under $65 million in dividends and approximately $48 million in share repurchases. For the quarter, we returned 92% of our income to shareholders in line with our objectives. On to slide seven, and net revenue by service. As a reminder, this slide represents the services revenue for all of our business units. I will not spend a lot of time on this slide, but rather will make comments about the various service revenues within the business segments. Moving to slide eight and our North American truckload price and cost chart. The graph on slide eight represents a few key metrics for the North American truckload business. On this graph, the light and dark blue lines represent the percent change in North American truckload rate per mile to customers and carriers net of fuel costs since 2008. The gray line is the net revenue margin for all transportation services. In this year\'s first quarter, the North American truckload rate per mile, net of fuel, fell 4% versus last year\'s first quarter while cost per mile fell 2%. The 4% decrease in customer pricing represented a step down versus the fourth quarter and this is reflective of both our contractual and transactional pricing. The cost per mile reverted to negative year-over-year versus being flat in the fourth quarter. The North American truckload market remains fairly balanced as it has been for the past few quarters, and pricing is very competitive given the fact that capacity is available and demand is tepid. From a shipment perspective, they are feeling the impact of a 25% increase in diesel prices in the first quarter, and that is certainly pressuring their freight budgets. We do believe that the market conditions will improve later in the year as the ELD mandate draws closer and the remaining carriers implement ELDs and realize a productivity impact related to the transition. Moving to slide nine and our transportation results. Total transportation revenues for all segments were up $14.3 billion to $3.1 billion in the first quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this is a result of our strong volume growth of 13% across all of our services in the quarter. Transportation net revenue margin decreased approximately 240 basis points from last year\'s first quarter to 17.3%. This was primarily the result of lower margins, and most of the transportation services with North American truckload margin compression having the greatest impact. Margin compression had an approximate 170 basis-point negative impact on margins in the quarter. Fuel also had a negative impact of 60 basis points, with diesel pricing up 25%. For the first time in four quarters, the net revenue margins, on overall transportation rose, albeit slightly, by 10 basis points as a result of mix shift and more LTL and global forwarding business. On to slide 10 and the reportable segments. We refer to North American Surface Transportation division as NAST. The NAST business is comprised of offices in the United States, Mexico and Canada, providing primarily truckload, less than truckload and intermodal services to consumers. NAST total revenues were $2.3 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 10.5% over last year\'s first quarter. NAST net revenues decreased 3% to $372 million in the quarter. Net revenue margin in NAST was 16.5% compared to last year\'s first quarter of 18. 8%. The lower margins were primarily the result of a lower customer pricing in the truckload business. NAST operating expenses decreased 2.2% in the first quarter of 2017. This decrease was largely due to the collection of the previously discussed legal claim as well as decreases in variable personnel expenses. Income from operations was down 4% to $156 million. NAST operating margin was 41.9% in the quarter. Employee count was 6,844, up 2.7%. We achieved solid productivity for person gains in the NAST business as volumes grew across the various services and combined 10%. The margin of compression meets the productivity gains in the quarter, but we feel really good about the fact that our initiatives around digitalization and leveraging our scale are yielding solid results. Now on to slide 11 and the results by service within NAST. John and I have highlighted some of the factors impacting our truckload business in the quarter. NAST truckload net revenues were down $16 million or 5.7%. Volumes were up 11% in the quarter as a result of growth in both our contractual and transactional shipments. We added 3,600 new carriers in the first quarter compared to approximately 2,600 in last year\'s first quarter. These new carriers moved over 18,000 shipments for us in the first quarter. The less than truckload business had another solid growth quarter with net revenues up 7.1% to $93.5 million. Volumes increased 8.5% when compared to the first quarter of last year. Pricing was up slightly, and net revenue margins were down slightly as we purchased transportation costs increased during the quarter. Intermodal net revenues decreased 17.3% in the quarter. However, volumes were up 14%. Over the past several quarters, we have been growing the contractual business at lower margins while transactional volumes are down quite a bit from last year\'s first quarter. On to Global Forwarding on slide 12. Total revenues for Global Forwarding segment in the first quarter were $469 million, up 33.5% versus last year. First quarter net revenues were $106.5 million, a 14.7% increase from 2016. APC Logistics was a significant contributor to this success in Global Forwarding, adding approximately 14% of the net revenue in the quarter. Our teams continue to do a nice job with the integration. Net revenue margin was 22.8%, down 360 basis points year-over-year. While we feel good about the progress in volume growth our teams are making, we did experience margin compression during the quarter primarily on the Ocean business. Income from operations was $16.2 million, down 3.9% in the first quarter. Operating margin was 15.2% in the quarter. The lower operating margin versus last year\'s first quarter was primarily the result of a lower net revenue margins and the acquisition amortization related to the purchase of APC. Headcount increased 12.6% in the quarter, with APC representing just over 300 employees or approximately 9% of additional employees in the business. Moving on to the Global Forwarding service lines on slide 13. Ocean net revenues were up 8.3% in the quarter, and APC contributed approximately 11.5% to the growth. Ocean\'s shipments increased approximately 27% in the quarter, and pricing was up in the ocean service line. The margin compression in the ocean service line, however, was primarily in the – our contractual business. Approximately 25% of our organic ocean volume has fixed pricing with customers and the increases in our cost per shipment impacted our first quarter margins. Air net revenues increased 17.2%. APC contributed approximately 12% to the growth. Air shipments increased approximately 38.6% in the quarter and pricing was again down. Our sales efforts are yielding good results and the team is excited about the momentum they are building, particularly in the global air consolidation centers. Customs net revenue increased 50%, with APC contributing approximately 37% to the growth. Customs transactions increased approximately 37.8% in the first quarter. Transitioning to our Robinson Fresh business on slide 14. Robinson Fresh, which is our global logistics and product division, is focused on fresh, temperature controlled supply chain. With our new reporting segment, we now share results inclusive of revenues from sourcing and transportation services whereas previously, we only reported sourcing revenue and rolled sourcing transportation up into the consolidated transportation reporting. Robinson Fresh total revenues were $550 million, a decrease of 2.4% in the first quarter. Net revenues were $57 million, down 2.3% from last year. Robinson Fresh operating expenses increased 4.3% in the first quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased head count to serve the 29% truckload volume growth, and an increase in SG&A expenses. Income from operations was $14.6 million, a decrease of 17.4%. And Robinson Fresh head count increased 4.2% in the quarter. Robinson Fresh sourcing total revenue declined 13.1%. The decrease in total revenue was a result of market pricing being down approximately 12% per case sold because of a supply surplus. Even with the lower gross sales, our product team did a nice job managing through these conditions and grew product net revenue by 3.9% year-over-year. Net revenue margin increased a 160 basis points in the first quarter as a result of the lower product cost driving a higher net revenue per case in our strategic and market commodities. I want to make a special callout to the sourcing team for the work they\'ve done in Q1 by focusing on new and existing customer growth. Robinson Fresh transportation total revenues increased 16.4% in the first quarter of 2017, driven by impressive volume growth of 24%. Robinson Fresh transportation net revenue decreased 8.6% in the first quarter of 2017, due primarily to truckload net revenue declining 10.7% in the quarter. Similar to our other transportation services, we believe we are gaining share and we continue to be optimistic about our growth in the long term. Moving to all other and corporate on slide 17. The all other category includes our Managed Services business, as well as Surface Transportation outside of North America and other miscellaneous revenues, as well as unallocated corporate expenses. Headcount was up 17.1%, and this was primarily the result of increases in technology, other enterprise resources and managed services. Net revenues for the other category increased 14.9% in the first quarter of 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, led by the continued strong performance in our Managed Services and our Surface Transportation business in Europe. Managed Services net revenue increased 17.9% in the first quarter of 2017 to $17.2 million, compared to $14.6 million in the first quarter of 2016. This increase the result of growth from both new and existing customers. Other surface transportation increased 11.8% in the first quarter of 2017 to $15.6 million, compared to $13.9 million in the first quarter of 2016. Again, primarily the result of growth in the European surface transportation business. Both businesses continue to be very profitable, with the decrease in operating income during the quarter being the result of some unallocated overhead expenses. Before I turn it back to John, I\'d like again to thank my colleagues for their continued hard work and dedication. With that, John will make some closing comments before we answer your questions. John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thank you, Andy. Before going on to those questions, I\'m going to share some thoughts on our final comments on slide 19. In April to-date, our total company net revenue has decreased approximately 4% per business day. This includes the additional revenue from the APC acquisition. The timing of the Easter holiday has been a small headwind for us in April, and we also had a strong April last year as this was our strongest month in the second quarter a year ago. Our North America truckload volume growth remains consistent with the first quarter and thus far in April. Overall, the market conditions remained fairly consistent with the past couple of quarters thus far in April. We typically close our prepared comments with some thoughts about our longer-term strategies and how we are planning to invest in our future growth. As most of you know, we\'ll be hosting an Investor Day session next week that will be webcasted that will update our future plans for each of our businesses. I\'ll close my prepared comments by highlighting some of the topics that we\'ll be addressing next week for those want to hear more. With regards to segment strategies, we have both enterprise and divisional strategies and growth initiatives. We\'ll be having our divisional leaders share updates on their respective strategies for each of the services as well as discussing how we work together as one team to share investments and leverage our network for better customer outcomes. With regards to capital allocations, Andy shared the capital distribution update for the quarter in an earlier slide. While we will remain committed to our target of distributing 90% of our net income, we\'ll also continue to explore ways to utilize our strong balance sheet as we have in the past by investing close to $1 billion in our Global Forwarding division over the past five years. With regards to market share opportunities, market share gains driven by effective sales and account management remain at the core of how we grow and create value. Each of our leaders will be discussing their plans for continued growth and market share gains. And lastly, both the competitive landscape and the investments in technology and our industry continue to grow and change very quickly. We are investing significantly more in our technology, and we\'re excited to share some perspective on our priorities and where we\'re investing to support our future growth. So that concludes our prepared comments for the quarter. And with that, I will turn it back to Tim to lead the question-and-answer session of the call. Operator Mr. Gagnon, the floor is yours for the Q&A session. Question-and-Answer Session Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Donna, and first I would like to thank all of the analysts and investors for taking the time to submit some really good questions late yesterday. I\'ll frame up those questions as they were submitted, and turn it over to John or Andy for their response. And we\'ll get right into that now. The first question is for Andy. How much of the 19% year-over-year increase in operating cost is Global – came from Global Forwarding and from APC in the quarter? What were the main drivers of the Global Forwarding expenses? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Yes, approximately 16% of the 19% increase in the operating cost in Global Forwarding were the results of APC. Included in that number is approximately $3 million of the amortization expense from the acquisition. Our volume growth outside of APC was 18%, and I think the Global Forwarding team did a very nice job of managing their head count growth as well as their overall operating expenses with such high volume growth in that. Remaining additional part, as John and I have talked about, is the increase in technology spend and the investments that we\'re making in that area to obviously help us with long-term productivity gains. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Personnel expense increases up 4.7% year-over-year this quarter continue to outpace revenue growth resulting in a reduced net income per head count. While on-boarding has appeared to slow, it is still up by 655 people, or 5.9% for 1Q. What levers are being utilized to support operating income per head count as it continues to decrease sequentially and year-over-year? John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. So those are some of the very important metrics that we do look at in terms of managing the efficiency and the productivity of our business. I would say that the headline answer to that question is this net revenue margin compression that we talked about throughout our prepared comments. If you look particularly within NAST, but all of the businesses, when we had an 11% transaction increase and a decrease in the net revenue that resulted from that, it does put a lot of productivity pressure on the network where our core productivity metric has been shipments per person and looking at the activity levels for – across our network. So when we have this part of the cycle where we have net revenue margin compression like we experienced this quarter, it does put pressure on our operating income per person. One of the reasons why we implemented segment reporting is that as we\'ve grown and diversified our business, it is very helpful to look at the pieces of that question. We\'ve talked quite a bit about Global Forwarding and the APC acquisition. If you look at that segment, that is where the most significant operating income relationship changed, in part because of the purchase accounting expenses that come in there, and part because of the additional head count. We like the Global Forwarding business. The ROI on that investment has been very positive to-date, but it does change some of the internal metrics with people spread around the world in a different type of business relationship. Similarly, in our corporate and other, where you see the largest head count growth around managed services and IT investments, we do have a different framework for looking at investment of talent in that area. So while the metrics that were pointing out are accurate, that the operating income per head count goes down, part of it cyclical, part of it varies across the different businesses that we have, and we will continue to manage that metric as best as we can. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. The next question for Andy. Interest expense increase sequentially to $9.3 million in the first quarter. Is that a good run rate going forward? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. There are three components to that figure. And the first one is, which is fixed, is our long-term debt. It\'s $500 million and it\'s a fixed rate. The second portion of that is our short-term debt, and there\'s two components that are impacting that. One, the number is bigger versus last year due to the acquisition of APC. And secondarily, it\'s floating and it\'s tied to LIBOR, and LIBOR has been up over that same time period. And so as LIBOR goes, you would expect our interest rate that we pay to fluctuate with that. The third function that\'s in there is foreign currency translations and the adjustments that are in there, and given that there is now nearly 20% of our business that\'s being generated outside of the United States, there is foreign currency fluctuations that roll through that line item. So, it\'s those three issues that are impacting it. The $9.3 million is a relatively good number but there is variability to that subject to foreign currency as well as LIBOR. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. To John with the next question. NAST net revenue margin improved sequentially, but operating margin ex the legal claim declined. What caused this divergence? Any color on the expected cadence for the remainder of the year would be appreciated as well? John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. This is really the follow on question to the first topic I addressed, only directed specifically at NAST around their net revenue margin versus the operating margins. Within the NAST results for the quarter, the real headline is the net revenue margin compression that caused that deterioration. I\'ll repeat what I had stated earlier. When you have that type of volume growth – and we are proud of the fact that we accommodated, and our network was able to manage that volume growth with a 3% head count within NAST. But when your net revenue margin compresses that much it is what drives the operating margin deterioration. In terms of the cadence for the rest of the year, we\'ve talked often about – it was kind of middle of 2016 where we saw a pretty significant change in the margins. So we do know that we have at least another quarter of more challenging margin comparisons for 2017. As we mentioned, our run rate of volume growth continues in April, so we would expect the results in the short-term future to be consistent with the past couple of quarters. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. How much business does Amazon do with Robinson on a gross revenue measure, and how aggressive have they been with pricing? Have they approached Robinson about becoming a larger intermodal partner? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Yeah. It\'s been our longstanding policy to not comment on the specifics of any customer, and if you look at our overall customer dynamics, we don\'t have a single customer that accounts for more than 2% of our gross revenue, and Amazon is not our largest customer, although they\'re in our top 50 customer. I would say that you would expect us and all of our account reps and all of our people across the 14,000 employees that we have worldwide to talk to every one of our customers about every one of the services that we provide. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. Next question to John. What\'s driving total company net revenue per day down 4% April to date? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. We addressed some of the April activity in the final comments that we prepared. You know, I guess what I would repeat is that there is a timing of the Easter Holiday which can impact the beginning of the April. The previous year, April was our strongest month in terms of second quarter growth last year so there could be some minor comparison challenge in that. So mostly it\'s a continuation of the same environment that we had in the first quarter, where there\'s high volume growth, and some net revenue margin compression. I think whenever we share kind of these mid-month numbers, things can change quite a bit with month-end push and other activities, so we like to give it a just a general gauge of what\'s happening. But I would say it\'s safe to sort of state that we are seeing activity that\'s pretty comparable to what we experienced in the first quarter. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. Next question to Andy. Please review what accounts for the sharply higher volume growth of the last three quarters in NAST, specifically North America truck load. These last three quarters have a pattern of continued lower pricing, but where the pricing is actually now falling more than your lower purchased transportation cost. Is this a function of re-contracting at prices lower than your falling cost, but in such a way that you were winning more volume? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Yes, we\'ll start off by first addressing NAST in general. And as we talked about, I think we\'ve done a great job in the entire NAST organization, both in the truck load growing volumes 11% in the quarter, LTL growing volumes 8.5%, and intermodal growing volumes at 14%. And so if you think about, what I would call the sell, and how do we go out and attract volume, and it\'s primarily through a couple of key elements. One is our people. We have great people out in the organization right now and account managers and sales reps and the carrier reps and everybody that works in that area of going out and aggressively pursuing market share. So I think those type of volume growths that we\'ve consistently seen over the last several quarters are really a recognition of the fact that our people are winning on a more frequent basis. And they\'re winning with the use of additional technology. So when we go out on that commitment and contractual business, your customers, our customers are intelligent, they know where the market is, and we\'ve got a be right there with them, and we\'re using data analytics, and we\'re using technology and we\'re using science to really win. And if you think about the percentage increase on a year-over-year basis where we\'re winning, it\'s up 400 basis points on that contractual business. So we really focus on those key elements. And even in the transactional business, there\'s more technology, and there\'s more resources that we\'re bringing to bear for our people. And our people are smart – and we\'re developing talent across the organization to help us win that business. So that\'s on the sell side. Now when you go out into the buy side, there\'s a lot of different factors that impact that. And as we talk about over the last three or four years, that committed and contractual business roughly bounces between 60%. Some quarters it\'s up a little, some quarters it\'s down, and the remaining 40% is in the spot. But when we go out to actually buy the capacity is the vast majority, 90 plus percent, is in that spot market. And again, I think we have really talented people that are going out there and buying very well and very effectively every day in that marketplace. And what you see is, over the long term, the trend lines of the routing guides. And that\'s really kind of important, and there\'s a nuance to it. When we go to set that pricing, as I mentioned earlier, you\'re setting committed and contractual prices for whether it\'s six months or a year in advance and you\'re predicting what will happen. Ultimately, what does happen is where things fall out on the routing guide. And if you\'d looked at this time last year the routing guide were in the low ones, which means, guess what? People are getting their freight covered rather effectively. As we went through the year, that routing guide started to bounce up off of the low floor, low one floor, into the mid-ones, and it\'s kind of stayed in that range, and there\'s some variability month to month in that, but it\'s stayed in that range, and so our people are using all that information to go out and attract more business, and at the same time I think really do an effective job in this marketplace of pricing it accordingly. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. With more business running under contractual arrangements, do you think there is a risk that margins compress more quickly than the market might expect in the event that truck market tightens? John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. One of the reasons why we added slide eight to our deck, that Andy shared some prepared comments about, is it shows, over the last decade, how our pricing to our customers and our costs of hire has varied and stayed together. And you can see on the chart from that last decade that there are periods of time where, you know, those two – the buy and sell rate will separate for a period of time, but what we like about the graph is it shows that over a decade, our business model and our teams are very disciplined at getting them back in line. It\'s true that as more of the business has become committed or contractual, you do have a little bit more price risk in terms of a significant change in market conditions around tightening capacity, a lot of discussion about whether the ELD requirements in December will be an event like that. If you look on that chart over the last decade, there were other CSA safety and hours of service type regulatory changes that had some impact on capacity that don\'t show up as all that significant. Who knows if the ELD event will be as well, but overall I guess we\'re proud of the fact that our business model adjusts for those types of market events, and we feel pretty confident about our ability to adjust to the market conditions if capacity does tighten significantly. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. Next question to Andy. Why was Coyote\'s aggressive pursuit of market share such a challenge for you when they were growing rapidly in 2012 and 2013? Why don\'t you expect Uber and Amazon to push into the freight brokerage markets to post a similar challenge for your business? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Well, I\'m glad you asked that question in the form that it was actually written, and I\'ll address the Coyote. But as it relates to – I don\'t think that\'s our perspective and opinion that Amazon and Uber won\'t have an impact to the marketplace. And I\'ll address that in a second. If you think about over any historical period that dovetails with what John had mentioned, there\'s the cyclical trends and then the secular trends, and the cyclical trends our outsourcing is increasing, and we like that because it\'s what we do. And I think that we\'ve been leading that industry for quite some period of time. Other competitors have entered the marketplace at different points in the cycle, and it tends to really show itself on a more material basis when the marketplace is balanced. So you go back to that time period that was mentioned, 2011, 2012, 2013, and the marketplace was balanced, which is kind of if you look at routing guides during that same time period is where they are today. So it feel like it\'s more balanced. Routing guides are more effective and they are more efficient, and loads are getting covered efficiently and effectively. And as a result, we went and got volume during that time period as well, and we were growing high single-digits, low double-digits during that period. So we were as aggressive in that marketplace as any of our competitors. If you look at today, and you look at the entrance of new competitors, and – by the way, all the ones that existed previously are still competing with us today. Whether they\'re independent or whether they were acquired, they\'re still competing in that marketplace. What we like about the – just from a macro perspective, thinking about the entrance of competitors, we think it validates the marketplace. We have for the longest time talked about the 3PL marketplace and the penetration of the overall for-hire truckload marketplace. And it started maybe a decade ago at the low-single digits and now it\'s 15%, 16%, 18% of the marketplace. We like the fact that when reputable competitors come in, it acknowledges the fact of what we do. It acknowledges the fact of what our people do, and we believe it\'s going to continue to drive up the acceptance and therefore the penetration rate of this brokerage and of the 3PL marketplace. We like they are bringing technology to bear. We like they are bringing people to bear. We like they are bringing relationships to bear to compete. And so we take seriously all of our competitors, regardless of the form that they take. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Have you noticed any significant changes in the ocean freight markets with the new alliances that launched this month? What kind of impact is that having on your business and how can you adjust? John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. The short answer to the question is "no", that we have not seen any impact on our business in the month of April. For those who may not be familiar with it, in the ocean industry there are vessel-sharing alliances, and the ocean carriers in those alliances made some changes and adjustments so that as of April 1st, there are new alliances that they\'re operating under. The primary impact to us historically and kind of going forward is that when we work with a customer that has a diversified carrier strategy, we have to make certain that by utilizing different carriers you\'re not actually putting the freight on the same vessel, even though you\'re using a different carrier because they\'re sharing the vessels. If you\'re worried about weather or different service disruptions, you want to make sure that you execute a diversified strategy by truly having alternative routes and different ways to ship your freight. The changes that were made April 1st over the long-term could have some meaningful impact. We have not seen any of that to date. We do have a team that aligns closely with all of those carrier groups and makes certain that as they change their routing and alliance procedures that we\'re able to adapt with them, and we feel pretty confident about being able to do that as well. So the short answer is no, no immediate impact thus far in April, and we\'ve worked through the alliance transitions before, and we will work through these and feel good about how we\'ll be able to manage it. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. How much over-supply of capacity is there in the current truckload market? How does that compare to where the year started? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. I wouldn\'t say that there\'s any material change from where the year started. It goes back to the routing guides, and routing guides are working very efficiently right now. We continue to add capacity, and we talk about the 3,600 carriers that we added during the quarter, which is up from Q1 of last year. And again, the nets about the same, we\'re still losing carriers as well, or carriers that are not running for us, and they covered 18,000 loads. It\'s – if you think about the overall tepid demand environment, the CAS (42:47) figures I believe for March were only up 0 .9%, and that was trending down through the quarter. It\'s not as much of a capacity story as it is demand. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. To John. Should we expect CHRW to continue hiring at this rate for the remainder of the year? John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. We do expect to continue to hire throughout 2017. If you kind of piece together the comments in our presentations and Q&A thus far, you know within the Global Forwarding division we had the APC acquisition that accelerated the increase in head count over the periods that we\'re talking about. So their growth going forward would not be at the same pace as it\'s been for the past couple of quarters. In terms of managed services, corporate and other and the IT spending that we\'ve mentioned a few times, we do expect to continue to invest in both of those areas. We have a committed backlog of future contracts to implement, so we know that we\'ll be bringing talent on and there will be an investment that\'s more future oriented around implementation costs and automation initiatives that we expect to benefit for the longer-term future. The other business units, we do expect them to continue to hire as well, particularly if the volume growth that we\'re experiencing continues, but that would be at a more modest pace like you saw during the quarter in the segment results as well. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. Net revenue growth in the first quarter was 0.9%. However, personnel expenses were up 4.7%. How much of this is tied to bonus incentive comp accruals versus head count growth, and should we be thinking about personnel expenses growing faster than net revenue for the remainder of this year given your investment in head count and IT? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Yes, and to dovetail with a number of questions that have been asked and the answers that we\'ve given, the net revenue growth of 0.9% was masked by the fact that volumes were growing at 13%, and personnel expenses up 4.7% on a 13% growth, when you\'re in a very challenging margin compression environment, it just – it kind of masks, I think, a lot of the good work that\'s occurring. The personnel expenses, that 4.7%, the dollar amounts were driven up by the fact that headcounts are up by nearly 8%, so the salaries associated with that are driving it up. The variable portion of compensation, be that our cash bonuses, as well as equity incentives, are down on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Can you remind us of the net revenue growth per day comps for the second quarter of 2016 by month? Also, can you provide the monthly net revenue per day for the first quarter of 2017? John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. So if you look at the first quarter that we just reported on with our overall 1% net revenue increase, the months January, February, March went plus 2%, minus 2%, plus 2%. So a little bit of fluctuation. Again, there\'s different number of business days and a number of things that can impact that. So a little bit of fluctuation, but nothing too significant. Last year, second quarter of 2016, we had shared at that time that our daily net revenue growth for April, May, June was plus 9%, flat, and minus 3%. So I believe I had made the comment earlier in one of the questions that as far as Q2 of this year is concerned, that April would be our most challenging comparison based upon the growth from the prior year, and looking at the daily activity in April, it\'s fairly consistent with the first quarter. It\'s just that we have a little bit different comparison. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. Next question to Andy on ocean services. Ocean pricing increased for the first quarter in almost two years. What did you see in the marketplace? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Yeah. The ocean pricing has been, and is still at historical lows, and there\'s variability around that. You think about coming in to the first quarter, you had a combination of the Chinese New Year, as well as the Hanjin bankruptcy, still the after effects of that bleeding in to 2017, but still very, very historical lows in terms of what the ocean costs are. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. What impact, if any, do you expect Amazon.com to have on the brokerage market, specifically market share and net revenue margins once its brokerage platform goes live later this year? John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. One of the things we\'ll be talking about next week in our Investor Day is just this escalation of activity in the competitive landscape. Andy touched on the point earlier that while we\'ve acknowledged, and everyone understands that our industry has become much more competitive over the last decade, that part of the positive trade-up on that is the expansion of the addressable market, and that particularly more recently a lot of these non-traditional competitors coming in to this space are coming in with the belief that the entire market is addressable, and not just the brokerage component of it. So I\'m not – Amazon hasn\'t been specific to kind of their go-to-market strategies or where in the big universe they are going to go after things. The only comment I\'m aware of is with regards to whether it\'s final mile or ocean activities or longer-haul trucking. They have stated that they expect significant growth in their own business to continue, and that a lot of these investments will initially be focused on accommodating some of their own growth and then expanding more into a broader market services after that. I have no idea if that\'s what their brokerage platform intents are, but that would be consistent with kind of what they\'ve said in other areas of the supply chain that they want to invest and grow in. So as I\'ll repeat again what Andy said earlier that we do think that digital transformations and all of the changes that we\'re going through and that are happening in our industry will have a very material impact, especially over the next decade or so as they all get traction and continue to make a greater and greater impact. And as far as what any one of them has in terms of the verticals or areas of the marketplace that they want to focus on initially, or what the short-term impact might be, it\'s difficult to assess at this point. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. To Andy, an ELD question. Has there been ELD discussions between Robinson and shippers or carriers? Do you expect the mandate to impact your carrier base? If so, what steps are you taking to be prepared for potential truck capacity tightening? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Yeah. This has been a topic that\'s not only top of mind for investors, but as you would imagine, top of mind for our customers and top of mind for our carriers. So we\'re having conversations every day with each of those respective parties. And it\'s difficult to categorize them in any one way, shape or form. So on the one hand, we talk to our customers and say that ELDs will have an impact to the overall marketplace, whether it be the actual availability of capacity or the productivity of that capacity. And yet, when we have those conversations, it seems like that the pricing environment continues to be challenged, because as I mentioned previously, routing guides are operating very effectively. And the desire to say lock-in or do something in advance of December is – it\'s just been very challenging in those conversations with customers despite the fact that we, they and everybody else know that it\'s coming. We have conversations with the carriers as well. And the good news, if you think about the bifurcation of the marketplace, whether it be small carriers, whom we contract with, or large carriers which we also contract with, we believe that it\'s a marketplace, and marketplaces ultimately adjust and adapt to what occurs. We believe that we are well positioned. We talk to our smaller carriers, and we have smaller carriers. In fact, we have single owner/operators that we recently had a conversation with that are ELD compliant today, and believe that they can continue to be compliant and productive and profitable despite the fact that they are running an ELD. And so, while there will be a disruption of some sort, that has yet to be (51:31), because we\'re still adding capacity in the marketplace right now, and we believe we will continue to do that. And when you have an effective and efficient marketplace, when there\'s dislocations and disruptions, people like C.H. Robinson are very effective in helping our customers secure that capacity. Whether we continue to do it in the small marketplace, which we will, or also access and tap the larger truck marketplace. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. Technology question for John. How do you more effectively use technology to leverage head count? John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. We have initiatives across all of our business areas to drive productivity and to drive efficiency by using automation and digital transformation. There will be a lot more presented about that next week again by our various leaders. You know, kind of using NAST, the biggest part of our business as probably the primary example, when you talk about the volume growth versus the more limited head count growth in the quarter. NAST itself is, you know, in the midst of a multi-year transformation, or reinvention around how our President, Bob Biesterfeld and his leadership team, are really changing the job families and the approach within the network to make sure that we better utilize the new automation, the new tools that we\'re creating to drive that productivity. Examples would be that we share data electronically far more aggressively than we did even five years ago. The number of EDI and API interactions that exchange data with both shippers and carriers have gone up significantly. The track and trace information that check-call stuff that was done more manually in the past, a lot of effort around automating that. A lot of algorithms to help you find a truck more effectively. A lot of pricing tools that can help you move quicker. So just across the business, there\'s a number of different initiatives of how we\'re structuring the network, how we\'re leveraging the automation tools, and we\'re already seeing some pretty positive results like we did in the first quarter with regards to the NAST business. So I could share analogies in each of the other areas. I don\'t think there\'s any one silver bullet or one giant thing that is driving that digital transformation. It\'s the combination of a lot of initiatives spread across the entire business that, again, we\'ll be sharing more about in the future. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. Next question, again, for Andy on capacity. Could you comment on what you\'re seeing from the small fleets, one to 20 trucks? Are you seeing some of your carriers exit the industry, or is capacity expanding? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Go back to – we continue to add capacity in the marketplace at a greater rate than we\'ve lost it. So adding 3,600 companies, and those 3,600, as you would imagine, all have less than 20 trucks. We continue to lose it, but not at a greater rate than what we\'ve seen over the last three or four or five quarters. So I wouldn\'t categorize it as expanding or contracting. I would say it\'s more a continuation of the status quo. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. To John again on competition. Technology impact on the competitive landscape. Are you seeing the transactional business becoming more commodity-like versus the stickier, specialized, perhaps, contractual business? John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. I would say that over the last decade or more, as we\'ve evolved our business more in to committed or contracted type freight relationships, the technology has obviously had significant impact on both that business, as well as the traditional transaction or more spot market relationships. There is pretty significant differences between the two. Like I mentioned earlier, around the exchange of information, the tendering of freight, the tendering of status updates, a lot of the automation that happens in that more committed business does make it stickier, and does benefit from a degree of technology and automation that is more long-term. It requires more of an investment up front, but then has more of an investment relationship to it over time. In the spot market, competition and automation are having a significant impact too, but it\'s probably more driven at pricing and kind of reacting quicker and making sure that you\'re interacting with both the shippers and the capacity side by whatever means their preference is. A lot of it is still telephone. Some of it we have what we think is as good a mobile App as anyone. There\'s a lot of different ways to interact in the marketplace, and in that spot market world it\'s less about customization and unique interfaces with somebody and more about making sure that you have a wide array of exposure and able to accommodate whatever variation of capacity is out there. So we have seen kind of this divergent -- divergence in the competitive landscape around the types of automation and the types of things that it takes to be competitive in both transactional and committed business. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. Can you talk about productivity or net revenue employee trends by segment, and address what impact recent forwarding acquisitions is having on this metric? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Yeah. Good question. And I\'m going to take it maybe even a couple layers deeper, which is – and let\'s start with the evolution of the company over the last decade, and net revenues are up roughly 8%, 9% over that last decade, and we\'ve been able to grow both organically within our North America Surface Trans and organically and via acquisition on the other parts of our business, and they each have different metrics that are associated with them. Inside of NAST, as an example, truckload now represents 52%, 53% of our overall net revenue to the organization. So not only have we done a good job within our NAST organization with truckload, but doing things like adding LTL and intermodal have had an impact on those productivity metrics. So it\'s hard to simply say, you know, the net revenue per person has done different things. And they have, because of the different investments that we\'ve made. But we\'ve also made I think really good investments in our people and the services that we offer. So today, you think about LTL being nearly $100 million of net revenue, that adds an entirely different metric in terms of not only net revenue per transaction but also net revenue per person, because it\'s a much more highly automated function than, say, truckload. Then when you get into Global Forwarding and you think about the investments that we made, not only in terms of the people and the technology, and – but it\'s a different margin, you know, it\'s 22% net revenue margins – pardon me, nearly 23% net revenue margins this quarter versus 16.5% net revenue margins in our North American Surface Trans, and within that you\'ve got customs, which is highly automated. You\'ve got ocean, which we do a lot of less-than-container-load consolidations, as well as air consolidation shipments. And the growth rate in that organization, and the fact that we now have employees throughout the globe, and they have different cost metrics associated with them, so we have nearly 1,500 people in Asia, and they\'re wonderful and they do great work, but as you would imagine, looking simply at a net revenue per person in that function, they have a much lower cost per person in that function as well. So it did, if you just looked at the overall metric itself, the net revenue per person has come down when we did the Global Forwarding acquisitions, but it comes at a higher net revenue margin and it comes at a lower cost per person in those key geographies where we compete.

Thanks, Donna, and first I would like to thank all of the analysts and investors for taking the time to submit some really good questions late yesterday. I\'ll frame up those questions as they were submitted, and turn it over to John or Andy for their response. And we\'ll get right into that now. The first question is for Andy. How much of the 19% year-over-year increase in operating cost is Global – came from Global Forwarding and from APC in the quarter? What were the main drivers of the Global Forwarding expenses? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Yes, approximately 16% of the 19% increase in the operating cost in Global Forwarding were the results of APC. Included in that number is approximately $3 million of the amortization expense from the acquisition. Our volume growth outside of APC was 18%, and I think the Global Forwarding team did a very nice job of managing their head count growth as well as their overall operating expenses with such high volume growth in that. Remaining additional part, as John and I have talked about, is the increase in technology spend and the investments that we\'re making in that area to obviously help us with long-term productivity gains. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Personnel expense increases up 4.7% year-over-year this quarter continue to outpace revenue growth resulting in a reduced net income per head count. While on-boarding has appeared to slow, it is still up by 655 people, or 5.9% for 1Q. What levers are being utilized to support operating income per head count as it continues to decrease sequentially and year-over-year? John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. So those are some of the very important metrics that we do look at in terms of managing the efficiency and the productivity of our business. I would say that the headline answer to that question is this net revenue margin compression that we talked about throughout our prepared comments. If you look particularly within NAST, but all of the businesses, when we had an 11% transaction increase and a decrease in the net revenue that resulted from that, it does put a lot of productivity pressure on the network where our core productivity metric has been shipments per person and looking at the activity levels for – across our network. So when we have this part of the cycle where we have net revenue margin compression like we experienced this quarter, it does put pressure on our operating income per person. One of the reasons why we implemented segment reporting is that as we\'ve grown and diversified our business, it is very helpful to look at the pieces of that question. We\'ve talked quite a bit about Global Forwarding and the APC acquisition. If you look at that segment, that is where the most significant operating income relationship changed, in part because of the purchase accounting expenses that come in there, and part because of the additional head count. We like the Global Forwarding business. The ROI on that investment has been very positive to-date, but it does change some of the internal metrics with people spread around the world in a different type of business relationship. Similarly, in our corporate and other, where you see the largest head count growth around managed services and IT investments, we do have a different framework for looking at investment of talent in that area. So while the metrics that were pointing out are accurate, that the operating income per head count goes down, part of it cyclical, part of it varies across the different businesses that we have, and we will continue to manage that metric as best as we can. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. The next question for Andy. Interest expense increase sequentially to $9.3 million in the first quarter. Is that a good run rate going forward? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. There are three components to that figure. And the first one is, which is fixed, is our long-term debt. It\'s $500 million and it\'s a fixed rate. The second portion of that is our short-term debt, and there\'s two components that are impacting that. One, the number is bigger versus last year due to the acquisition of APC. And secondarily, it\'s floating and it\'s tied to LIBOR, and LIBOR has been up over that same time period. And so as LIBOR goes, you would expect our interest rate that we pay to fluctuate with that. The third function that\'s in there is foreign currency translations and the adjustments that are in there, and given that there is now nearly 20% of our business that\'s being generated outside of the United States, there is foreign currency fluctuations that roll through that line item. So, it\'s those three issues that are impacting it. The $9.3 million is a relatively good number but there is variability to that subject to foreign currency as well as LIBOR. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. To John with the next question. NAST net revenue margin improved sequentially, but operating margin ex the legal claim declined. What caused this divergence? Any color on the expected cadence for the remainder of the year would be appreciated as well? John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. This is really the follow on question to the first topic I addressed, only directed specifically at NAST around their net revenue margin versus the operating margins. Within the NAST results for the quarter, the real headline is the net revenue margin compression that caused that deterioration. I\'ll repeat what I had stated earlier. When you have that type of volume growth – and we are proud of the fact that we accommodated, and our network was able to manage that volume growth with a 3% head count within NAST. But when your net revenue margin compresses that much it is what drives the operating margin deterioration. In terms of the cadence for the rest of the year, we\'ve talked often about – it was kind of middle of 2016 where we saw a pretty significant change in the margins. So we do know that we have at least another quarter of more challenging margin comparisons for 2017. As we mentioned, our run rate of volume growth continues in April, so we would expect the results in the short-term future to be consistent with the past couple of quarters. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. How much business does Amazon do with Robinson on a gross revenue measure, and how aggressive have they been with pricing? Have they approached Robinson about becoming a larger intermodal partner? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Yeah. It\'s been our longstanding policy to not comment on the specifics of any customer, and if you look at our overall customer dynamics, we don\'t have a single customer that accounts for more than 2% of our gross revenue, and Amazon is not our largest customer, although they\'re in our top 50 customer. I would say that you would expect us and all of our account reps and all of our people across the 14,000 employees that we have worldwide to talk to every one of our customers about every one of the services that we provide. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. Next question to John. What\'s driving total company net revenue per day down 4% April to date? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. We addressed some of the April activity in the final comments that we prepared. You know, I guess what I would repeat is that there is a timing of the Easter Holiday which can impact the beginning of the April. The previous year, April was our strongest month in terms of second quarter growth last year so there could be some minor comparison challenge in that. So mostly it\'s a continuation of the same environment that we had in the first quarter, where there\'s high volume growth, and some net revenue margin compression. I think whenever we share kind of these mid-month numbers, things can change quite a bit with month-end push and other activities, so we like to give it a just a general gauge of what\'s happening. But I would say it\'s safe to sort of state that we are seeing activity that\'s pretty comparable to what we experienced in the first quarter. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. Next question to Andy. Please review what accounts for the sharply higher volume growth of the last three quarters in NAST, specifically North America truck load. These last three quarters have a pattern of continued lower pricing, but where the pricing is actually now falling more than your lower purchased transportation cost. Is this a function of re-contracting at prices lower than your falling cost, but in such a way that you were winning more volume? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Yes, we\'ll start off by first addressing NAST in general. And as we talked about, I think we\'ve done a great job in the entire NAST organization, both in the truck load growing volumes 11% in the quarter, LTL growing volumes 8.5%, and intermodal growing volumes at 14%. And so if you think about, what I would call the sell, and how do we go out and attract volume, and it\'s primarily through a couple of key elements. One is our people. We have great people out in the organization right now and account managers and sales reps and the carrier reps and everybody that works in that area of going out and aggressively pursuing market share. So I think those type of volume growths that we\'ve consistently seen over the last several quarters are really a recognition of the fact that our people are winning on a more frequent basis. And they\'re winning with the use of additional technology. So when we go out on that commitment and contractual business, your customers, our customers are intelligent, they know where the market is, and we\'ve got a be right there with them, and we\'re using data analytics, and we\'re using technology and we\'re using science to really win. And if you think about the percentage increase on a year-over-year basis where we\'re winning, it\'s up 400 basis points on that contractual business. So we really focus on those key elements. And even in the transactional business, there\'s more technology, and there\'s more resources that we\'re bringing to bear for our people. And our people are smart – and we\'re developing talent across the organization to help us win that business. So that\'s on the sell side. Now when you go out into the buy side, there\'s a lot of different factors that impact that. And as we talk about over the last three or four years, that committed and contractual business roughly bounces between 60%. Some quarters it\'s up a little, some quarters it\'s down, and the remaining 40% is in the spot. But when we go out to actually buy the capacity is the vast majority, 90 plus percent, is in that spot market. And again, I think we have really talented people that are going out there and buying very well and very effectively every day in that marketplace. And what you see is, over the long term, the trend lines of the routing guides. And that\'s really kind of important, and there\'s a nuance to it. When we go to set that pricing, as I mentioned earlier, you\'re setting committed and contractual prices for whether it\'s six months or a year in advance and you\'re predicting what will happen. Ultimately, what does happen is where things fall out on the routing guide. And if you\'d looked at this time last year the routing guide were in the low ones, which means, guess what? People are getting their freight covered rather effectively. As we went through the year, that routing guide started to bounce up off of the low floor, low one floor, into the mid-ones, and it\'s kind of stayed in that range, and there\'s some variability month to month in that, but it\'s stayed in that range, and so our people are using all that information to go out and attract more business, and at the same time I think really do an effective job in this marketplace of pricing it accordingly. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. With more business running under contractual arrangements, do you think there is a risk that margins compress more quickly than the market might expect in the event that truck market tightens? John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. One of the reasons why we added slide eight to our deck, that Andy shared some prepared comments about, is it shows, over the last decade, how our pricing to our customers and our costs of hire has varied and stayed together. And you can see on the chart from that last decade that there are periods of time where, you know, those two – the buy and sell rate will separate for a period of time, but what we like about the graph is it shows that over a decade, our business model and our teams are very disciplined at getting them back in line. It\'s true that as more of the business has become committed or contractual, you do have a little bit more price risk in terms of a significant change in market conditions around tightening capacity, a lot of discussion about whether the ELD requirements in December will be an event like that. If you look on that chart over the last decade, there were other CSA safety and hours of service type regulatory changes that had some impact on capacity that don\'t show up as all that significant. Who knows if the ELD event will be as well, but overall I guess we\'re proud of the fact that our business model adjusts for those types of market events, and we feel pretty confident about our ability to adjust to the market conditions if capacity does tighten significantly. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. Next question to Andy. Why was Coyote\'s aggressive pursuit of market share such a challenge for you when they were growing rapidly in 2012 and 2013? Why don\'t you expect Uber and Amazon to push into the freight brokerage markets to post a similar challenge for your business? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Well, I\'m glad you asked that question in the form that it was actually written, and I\'ll address the Coyote. But as it relates to – I don\'t think that\'s our perspective and opinion that Amazon and Uber won\'t have an impact to the marketplace. And I\'ll address that in a second. If you think about over any historical period that dovetails with what John had mentioned, there\'s the cyclical trends and then the secular trends, and the cyclical trends our outsourcing is increasing, and we like that because it\'s what we do. And I think that we\'ve been leading that industry for quite some period of time. Other competitors have entered the marketplace at different points in the cycle, and it tends to really show itself on a more material basis when the marketplace is balanced. So you go back to that time period that was mentioned, 2011, 2012, 2013, and the marketplace was balanced, which is kind of if you look at routing guides during that same time period is where they are today. So it feel like it\'s more balanced. Routing guides are more effective and they are more efficient, and loads are getting covered efficiently and effectively. And as a result, we went and got volume during that time period as well, and we were growing high single-digits, low double-digits during that period. So we were as aggressive in that marketplace as any of our competitors. If you look at today, and you look at the entrance of new competitors, and – by the way, all the ones that existed previously are still competing with us today. Whether they\'re independent or whether they were acquired, they\'re still competing in that marketplace. What we like about the – just from a macro perspective, thinking about the entrance of competitors, we think it validates the marketplace. We have for the longest time talked about the 3PL marketplace and the penetration of the overall for-hire truckload marketplace. And it started maybe a decade ago at the low-single digits and now it\'s 15%, 16%, 18% of the marketplace. We like the fact that when reputable competitors come in, it acknowledges the fact of what we do. It acknowledges the fact of what our people do, and we believe it\'s going to continue to drive up the acceptance and therefore the penetration rate of this brokerage and of the 3PL marketplace. We like they are bringing technology to bear. We like they are bringing people to bear. We like they are bringing relationships to bear to compete. And so we take seriously all of our competitors, regardless of the form that they take. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Have you noticed any significant changes in the ocean freight markets with the new alliances that launched this month? What kind of impact is that having on your business and how can you adjust? John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. The short answer to the question is "no", that we have not seen any impact on our business in the month of April. For those who may not be familiar with it, in the ocean industry there are vessel-sharing alliances, and the ocean carriers in those alliances made some changes and adjustments so that as of April 1st, there are new alliances that they\'re operating under. The primary impact to us historically and kind of going forward is that when we work with a customer that has a diversified carrier strategy, we have to make certain that by utilizing different carriers you\'re not actually putting the freight on the same vessel, even though you\'re using a different carrier because they\'re sharing the vessels. If you\'re worried about weather or different service disruptions, you want to make sure that you execute a diversified strategy by truly having alternative routes and different ways to ship your freight. The changes that were made April 1st over the long-term could have some meaningful impact. We have not seen any of that to date. We do have a team that aligns closely with all of those carrier groups and makes certain that as they change their routing and alliance procedures that we\'re able to adapt with them, and we feel pretty confident about being able to do that as well. So the short answer is no, no immediate impact thus far in April, and we\'ve worked through the alliance transitions before, and we will work through these and feel good about how we\'ll be able to manage it. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. How much over-supply of capacity is there in the current truckload market? How does that compare to where the year started? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. I wouldn\'t say that there\'s any material change from where the year started. It goes back to the routing guides, and routing guides are working very efficiently right now. We continue to add capacity, and we talk about the 3,600 carriers that we added during the quarter, which is up from Q1 of last year. And again, the nets about the same, we\'re still losing carriers as well, or carriers that are not running for us, and they covered 18,000 loads. It\'s – if you think about the overall tepid demand environment, the CAS (42:47) figures I believe for March were only up 0 .9%, and that was trending down through the quarter. It\'s not as much of a capacity story as it is demand. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. To John. Should we expect CHRW to continue hiring at this rate for the remainder of the year? John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. We do expect to continue to hire throughout 2017. If you kind of piece together the comments in our presentations and Q&A thus far, you know within the Global Forwarding division we had the APC acquisition that accelerated the increase in head count over the periods that we\'re talking about. So their growth going forward would not be at the same pace as it\'s been for the past couple of quarters. In terms of managed services, corporate and other and the IT spending that we\'ve mentioned a few times, we do expect to continue to invest in both of those areas. We have a committed backlog of future contracts to implement, so we know that we\'ll be bringing talent on and there will be an investment that\'s more future oriented around implementation costs and automation initiatives that we expect to benefit for the longer-term future. The other business units, we do expect them to continue to hire as well, particularly if the volume growth that we\'re experiencing continues, but that would be at a more modest pace like you saw during the quarter in the segment results as well. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. Net revenue growth in the first quarter was 0.9%. However, personnel expenses were up 4.7%. How much of this is tied to bonus incentive comp accruals versus head count growth, and should we be thinking about personnel expenses growing faster than net revenue for the remainder of this year given your investment in head count and IT? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Yes, and to dovetail with a number of questions that have been asked and the answers that we\'ve given, the net revenue growth of 0.9% was masked by the fact that volumes were growing at 13%, and personnel expenses up 4.7% on a 13% growth, when you\'re in a very challenging margin compression environment, it just – it kind of masks, I think, a lot of the good work that\'s occurring. The personnel expenses, that 4.7%, the dollar amounts were driven up by the fact that headcounts are up by nearly 8%, so the salaries associated with that are driving it up. The variable portion of compensation, be that our cash bonuses, as well as equity incentives, are down on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. Can you remind us of the net revenue growth per day comps for the second quarter of 2016 by month? Also, can you provide the monthly net revenue per day for the first quarter of 2017? John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. So if you look at the first quarter that we just reported on with our overall 1% net revenue increase, the months January, February, March went plus 2%, minus 2%, plus 2%. So a little bit of fluctuation. Again, there\'s different number of business days and a number of things that can impact that. So a little bit of fluctuation, but nothing too significant. Last year, second quarter of 2016, we had shared at that time that our daily net revenue growth for April, May, June was plus 9%, flat, and minus 3%. So I believe I had made the comment earlier in one of the questions that as far as Q2 of this year is concerned, that April would be our most challenging comparison based upon the growth from the prior year, and looking at the daily activity in April, it\'s fairly consistent with the first quarter. It\'s just that we have a little bit different comparison. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. Next question to Andy on ocean services. Ocean pricing increased for the first quarter in almost two years. What did you see in the marketplace? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Yeah. The ocean pricing has been, and is still at historical lows, and there\'s variability around that. You think about coming in to the first quarter, you had a combination of the Chinese New Year, as well as the Hanjin bankruptcy, still the after effects of that bleeding in to 2017, but still very, very historical lows in terms of what the ocean costs are. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. Next question for John. What impact, if any, do you expect Amazon.com to have on the brokerage market, specifically market share and net revenue margins once its brokerage platform goes live later this year? John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. One of the things we\'ll be talking about next week in our Investor Day is just this escalation of activity in the competitive landscape. Andy touched on the point earlier that while we\'ve acknowledged, and everyone understands that our industry has become much more competitive over the last decade, that part of the positive trade-up on that is the expansion of the addressable market, and that particularly more recently a lot of these non-traditional competitors coming in to this space are coming in with the belief that the entire market is addressable, and not just the brokerage component of it. So I\'m not – Amazon hasn\'t been specific to kind of their go-to-market strategies or where in the big universe they are going to go after things. The only comment I\'m aware of is with regards to whether it\'s final mile or ocean activities or longer-haul trucking. They have stated that they expect significant growth in their own business to continue, and that a lot of these investments will initially be focused on accommodating some of their own growth and then expanding more into a broader market services after that. I have no idea if that\'s what their brokerage platform intents are, but that would be consistent with kind of what they\'ve said in other areas of the supply chain that they want to invest and grow in. So as I\'ll repeat again what Andy said earlier that we do think that digital transformations and all of the changes that we\'re going through and that are happening in our industry will have a very material impact, especially over the next decade or so as they all get traction and continue to make a greater and greater impact. And as far as what any one of them has in terms of the verticals or areas of the marketplace that they want to focus on initially, or what the short-term impact might be, it\'s difficult to assess at this point. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. To Andy, an ELD question. Has there been ELD discussions between Robinson and shippers or carriers? Do you expect the mandate to impact your carrier base? If so, what steps are you taking to be prepared for potential truck capacity tightening? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Yeah. This has been a topic that\'s not only top of mind for investors, but as you would imagine, top of mind for our customers and top of mind for our carriers. So we\'re having conversations every day with each of those respective parties. And it\'s difficult to categorize them in any one way, shape or form. So on the one hand, we talk to our customers and say that ELDs will have an impact to the overall marketplace, whether it be the actual availability of capacity or the productivity of that capacity. And yet, when we have those conversations, it seems like that the pricing environment continues to be challenged, because as I mentioned previously, routing guides are operating very effectively. And the desire to say lock-in or do something in advance of December is – it\'s just been very challenging in those conversations with customers despite the fact that we, they and everybody else know that it\'s coming. We have conversations with the carriers as well. And the good news, if you think about the bifurcation of the marketplace, whether it be small carriers, whom we contract with, or large carriers which we also contract with, we believe that it\'s a marketplace, and marketplaces ultimately adjust and adapt to what occurs. We believe that we are well positioned. We talk to our smaller carriers, and we have smaller carriers. In fact, we have single owner/operators that we recently had a conversation with that are ELD compliant today, and believe that they can continue to be compliant and productive and profitable despite the fact that they are running an ELD. And so, while there will be a disruption of some sort, that has yet to be (51:31), because we\'re still adding capacity in the marketplace right now, and we believe we will continue to do that. And when you have an effective and efficient marketplace, when there\'s dislocations and disruptions, people like C.H. Robinson are very effective in helping our customers secure that capacity. Whether we continue to do it in the small marketplace, which we will, or also access and tap the larger truck marketplace. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. Technology question for John. How do you more effectively use technology to leverage head count? John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. We have initiatives across all of our business areas to drive productivity and to drive efficiency by using automation and digital transformation. There will be a lot more presented about that next week again by our various leaders. You know, kind of using NAST, the biggest part of our business as probably the primary example, when you talk about the volume growth versus the more limited head count growth in the quarter. NAST itself is, you know, in the midst of a multi-year transformation, or reinvention around how our President, Bob Biesterfeld and his leadership team, are really changing the job families and the approach within the network to make sure that we better utilize the new automation, the new tools that we\'re creating to drive that productivity. Examples would be that we share data electronically far more aggressively than we did even five years ago. The number of EDI and API interactions that exchange data with both shippers and carriers have gone up significantly. The track and trace information that check-call stuff that was done more manually in the past, a lot of effort around automating that. A lot of algorithms to help you find a truck more effectively. A lot of pricing tools that can help you move quicker. So just across the business, there\'s a number of different initiatives of how we\'re structuring the network, how we\'re leveraging the automation tools, and we\'re already seeing some pretty positive results like we did in the first quarter with regards to the NAST business. So I could share analogies in each of the other areas. I don\'t think there\'s any one silver bullet or one giant thing that is driving that digital transformation. It\'s the combination of a lot of initiatives spread across the entire business that, again, we\'ll be sharing more about in the future. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. Next question, again, for Andy on capacity. Could you comment on what you\'re seeing from the small fleets, one to 20 trucks? Are you seeing some of your carriers exit the industry, or is capacity expanding? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Go back to – we continue to add capacity in the marketplace at a greater rate than we\'ve lost it. So adding 3,600 companies, and those 3,600, as you would imagine, all have less than 20 trucks. We continue to lose it, but not at a greater rate than what we\'ve seen over the last three or four or five quarters. So I wouldn\'t categorize it as expanding or contracting. I would say it\'s more a continuation of the status quo. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, Andy. To John again on competition. Technology impact on the competitive landscape. Are you seeing the transactional business becoming more commodity-like versus the stickier, specialized, perhaps, contractual business? John P. Wiehoff - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. I would say that over the last decade or more, as we\'ve evolved our business more in to committed or contracted type freight relationships, the technology has obviously had significant impact on both that business, as well as the traditional transaction or more spot market relationships. There is pretty significant differences between the two. Like I mentioned earlier, around the exchange of information, the tendering of freight, the tendering of status updates, a lot of the automation that happens in that more committed business does make it stickier, and does benefit from a degree of technology and automation that is more long-term. It requires more of an investment up front, but then has more of an investment relationship to it over time. In the spot market, competition and automation are having a significant impact too, but it\'s probably more driven at pricing and kind of reacting quicker and making sure that you\'re interacting with both the shippers and the capacity side by whatever means their preference is. A lot of it is still telephone. Some of it we have what we think is as good a mobile App as anyone. There\'s a lot of different ways to interact in the marketplace, and in that spot market world it\'s less about customization and unique interfaces with somebody and more about making sure that you have a wide array of exposure and able to accommodate whatever variation of capacity is out there. So we have seen kind of this divergent -- divergence in the competitive landscape around the types of automation and the types of things that it takes to be competitive in both transactional and committed business. Timothy D. Gagnon - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Thanks, John. Next question for Andy. Can you talk about productivity or net revenue employee trends by segment, and address what impact recent forwarding acquisitions is having on this metric? Andrew C. Clarke - C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Yeah. Good question. And I\'m going to take it maybe even a couple layers deeper, which is – and let\'s start with the evolution of the company over the last decade, and net revenues are up roughly 8%, 9% over that last decade, and we\'ve been able to grow both organically within our North America Surface Trans and organically and via acquisition on the other parts of our business, and they each have different metrics that are associated with them. Inside of NAST, as an example, truckload now represents 52%, 53% of our overall net revenue to the organization. So not only have we done a good job within our NAST organization with truckload, but doing things like adding LTL and intermodal have had an impact on those productivity metrics. So it\'s hard to simply say, you know, the net revenue per person has done different things. And they have, because of the different investments that we\'ve made. But we\'ve also made I think really good investments in our people and the services that we offer. So today, you think about LTL being nearly $100 million of net revenue, that adds an entirely different metric in terms of not only net revenue per transaction but also net revenue per person, because it\'s a much more highly automated function than, say, truckload. Then when you get into Global Forwarding and you think about the investments that we made, not only in terms of the people and the technology, and – but it\'s a different margin, you know, it\'s 22% net revenue margins – pardon me, nearly 23% net revenue margins this quarter versus 16.5% net revenue margins in our North American Surface Trans, and within that you\'ve got customs, which is highly automated. You\'ve got ocean, which we do a lot of less-than-container-load consolidations, as well as air consolidation shipments. And the growth rate in that organization, and the fact that we now have employees throughout the globe, and they have different cost metrics associated with them, so we have nearly 1,500 people in Asia, and they\'re wonderful and they do great work, but as you would imagine, looking simply at a net revenue per person in that function, they have a much lower cost per person in that function as well. So it did, if you just looked at the overall metric itself, the net revenue per person has come down when we did the Global Forwarding acquisitions, but it comes at a higher net revenue margin and it comes at a lower cost per person in those key geographies where we compete.

(NASDAQ: CHTR ) 4th Annual MoffettNathanson Media & Communications Summit May 17, 2017 11:00 AM ET Executives Craig Moffett – MoffettNathanson LLC Thomas Rutledge – Chief Executive Officer Analysts Craig Moffett And again apologies the room is a little tight. So apologies for that in advance. But thank you all for joining us. Thank you for those of you who are on the webcast for joining us as well. And this is a real treat. Tom your are the first four time guest at our Summit. We have had a lot of companies who have done it four times but it is terrific to have you back. I was just reflecting, when we had our first summit and you sat in that exact same chair, your stock was at $143 a share, and Comcast was about three months into the regulatory approval to acquire Time Warner Cable. So it\'s fair to say a lot has happened. Thomas Rutledge All is well that ends well. Craig Moffett I wanted to start with what you\'ve learned in the consolidation process of Time Warner Cable and Bright House now. You\'re almost exactly a year in. What\'s gone well? And what\'s taken longer or been more costly than you expected? Thomas Rutledge Well, the name of our deal was Safari. And I guess, we found Livingston along the way. The – it was long and arduous. And getting it done, obviously, took us an odd path. But fundamentally, I approached the acquisition with the notion that the cable infrastructure was a superior infrastructure and that properly managed and property – properly capitalized, it could stand up superior products and services relative to its competitors and win in the marketplace and had a great growth path in front of it.  And if you actually increase the penetration of a fixed asset, the economics of that are fantastic. And that opportunity requires a lot of work, actually, though, to make that happen and to transform a company so that it is capable of using its assets. And the cable industry was slow to respond to the satellite, all-digital threat, and had its signals clogged, its Spectrum clogged the panel of signals and had the capacity to take up its data speeds more rapidly than it did, has the capacity to be a better service provider and has the capacity to use voice and other product, security, other services to improve the attributes of the communications connectivity such that it could drive itself deeper into the marketplace.  And really, it wasn\'t doing that. And so – but in order to do that, there\'s a lot of work, especially in an acquisition – and especially in an acquisition the size of the one we did, which was significantly bigger than us. And it\'s working the way I expected it to work, and the time lines are working as I expected it to work. And we\'re achieving the results as I expected. Now there are issues with recreating a company and combining two companies that require spending money, spending capital, spending operating dollars then getting the results of those and having those flow through the financial statement.  And right now, we\'re in the putting-it-together stage. We\'ve actually rolled out all of the pricing and packaging. We\'re getting the response out of the marketplace that we expected. And once you get the marketing response and the subscription response, you expect the economics flow. And you can predict them quite easily. Craig Moffett So, you\'ve always thought about the business as – and I can remember all the lessons you\'ve taught over the years about measuring a business by the subscribers you don\'t have yet and maximizing the revenue per home passed rather than subscriber. Are you looking at your shops as you look at the new territories and think about all of that greenfield and – or white space or whatever the right analysis that you see? Thomas Rutledge Yes, yes. No, that\'s it. If you think about our cable company, one way to look at it, if you could move space and time, it\'s 50 million homes passed where there\'s 26 million customers and 24 million non- customers. In front of the 24 million non-customers, if you could put them all together, you\'d have a fully capitalized infrastructure in front of 24 million potential passing. Would you rather have that? Or would you rather have the 26 million existing customers and the ARPU changes you can make out of that? I want both. But – and we have both. But when I think about the business – we’ve got this three cable companies built In front of the 24 million non-subscribers. Craig Moffett We’ll talk about that in a second. A little more prosaically. If I think about the three year synergy target that you\'ve outlined for the deal of about $1 billion, can you give me more color on how quickly you realize that? And have you discovered anything new about how long the runway is? Is that still the right number? Thomas Rutledge Well, we said that we would get to about $700 million of run rate this year, in the middle of this year, and $1 billion in three years. When we say synergy, we mean cost as a result of the transaction that come out of the business as opposed to all of the operating synergies that are in our business model, which are still there as well. So we – there\'s a general margin improvement that comes from the way we operate the business and intend to operate the business going forward. None of those kind of margin improvements are in our synergy numbers.  So I could tell you how we\'re going to get all of those if you want to hear it, but we\'re on track for the publicly disclosed synergies related to the transaction. Craig Moffett I’ll come back to some of those – some of that operating leverage and those margin opportunities in a minute. But usually, I start the conversation with you about the broadband business. But I want to start on the video side this time. There\'s been a really market acceleration in the rate of cord cutting. You\'ve always expressed some skepticism about how wide the appeal of virtual MVPDs would be. Have you changed your view at all as you\'ve seen programmers increasingly sort of arm all of these virtual MVPDs with more and more better content at what are pretty aggressively low retail prices at least even – we don\'t know that wholesale prices, but the retail prices are awfully low?  Thomas Rutledge Yeah, it is the question gets asked a lot of different ways. People talk about skinny bundles. People talk about over-the- top, and they\'re different concepts. One is how can you – what programming companies allow themselves to be packaged in smaller packages that result in less penetration? And that\'s a hard decision to make if you have a highly penetrated business. And so I don\'t think you see a lot of that really happening in the over-the-top space. So will there be rich pot over-the-top products? Maybe so, but no margins, or so but no margins, at least for promotional purposes. Which cable is already sold that way? I think, yes, there\'ll be competitive pressure there. But when you look back over the last five years, I was looking at the numbers, the whole MVPD marketplace has shed about three million customers over five years now. I said Disney – some people are talking about Disney, ESPN losing 11 million customers over that period of time. And if you look at – during that same period, the over-the-top providers, through the end of 2016, 1.5 million customers,, you could argue that a little bit either way. So – and if you look at telcos\' effect on cable, I do think that there\'ll be some chipping around the margins.  And I do think there\'s, on the margin, less MVPD customers, which, I think, is a cost-driven issue. I do think there are other issues besides just costs. Used to be, when a young guy would go out to college, if you live off-campus, you would subscribe to cable to get ESPN. Now he gets it over-the-top from his parents\' account.  So a lot of loss on the margin is really about lack of security and the inability of content companies who are becoming distributing companies and controlling where their product goes. But if you look at the whole pie, yes, people want to save money because it\'s too expensive, and there\'s some downgrading within the category, but the vast majority of people are still subscribing to a video package and an MVPD or a package of that.  Craig Moffett This lack of security content, you\'ve made some headlines at our conference over the past few years by talking about that. And so – but the numbers that you just laid out for ESPN, for example, of their loss significantly larger than the loss for MVPDs in general, but the translation to virtual MVPD is quite a bit smaller than the Is that gap in your mind a piracy issue? Is that gap a… Thomas Rutledge Listen – yes, – so piracy changes the elasticity of demand a lot, typically to the person who\'s stealing it or taking it. But it changes the overall value proposition, but so does price increases. And you\'ve had both. And so you have people managing their packages down to basic-only, broadcast-only, and there\'s more – that\'s the biggest phenomenon. And some cable companies have let that happen in the way their market their product, too. Craig Moffett And stepping off of that, presumably, it\'s easier than stepping off of the entire bundle. Lets put your head on now as a negotiator when a programmer comes into the room. How does the conversation we just had about the way the programmers have responded to the various threats in their business and with the rise of virtual MVPDs and OTT, how does that change the way you negotiate with your programming partners? Thomas Rutledge I’ve actually seen a lot of change of heart in programmers recently in terms of their desire to be – to rekindle an affiliation as opposed to just a transactional relationship. And there\'s a lot we can do for them in terms of advertising platforms and making their business more successful by helping them sell more high-quality, higher-CPM products and improve the video experience. There\'s a lot we can do, and a lot of people are concerned about their general position and don\'t want to be disaggregated from the bundle.  And – but they have a problem with growth, and they have a problem with rates. They have a problem with advertising. Even with all their problems, though, it doesn\'t mean they should rip themselves apart and become 20% penetrated product. So they\'re looking to find new ways to create new customer experiences that are good for customers, and they\'re looking at us and seeing what we have and seeking ways to work with us that are somewhat new.  Craig Moffett Do you think it changes the long-term trajectory of – that cost item for you has been growing at high single digits for few decades or at least a decade. Does it – as you look out, in aggregate, with the content community, what do you see for that cost trajectory?  Thomas Rutledge I think it\'s marginally going to change to our benefit, but not much. So I think the general trend is the more likely scenario. But I think on the edges, it\'s – there\'s a lot of pressure on the price for the content companies. And it\'s even – they\'ve gotten to a point where, they are not realizing the value of the price because it\'s translating into the marginal sub-loss.  Craig Moffett Right, as I think about the Q side of P times Q for a second, the quantity, I don\'t want to look too far out and just focus on virtual MVPDs and the OTT stuff. What about your legacy competitor\'s satellite? What have you seen with respect to the competitive dynamics of you and the satellite business?  Thomas Rutledge Look I think that\'s our biggest opportunity in terms of market share. I think we have a superior platform to satellite, and we can create customer relationships as a result of the better products that we stand up, the interactive products and the nature of television viewing going forward and the advertising products that we can stand up. So – and that combined with high-speed data and other products that we can sell to make the total value of the customer relationships better. So I expect to grow our business. I expect to grow video. And I expect to grow data. And I expect to grow voice.  Craig Moffett And grow video in subscribers, not just in dollars.  Thomas Rutledge Both and I expect to grow video in subscribers and I expect to grow expanded videos expanded video even faster than basic video. Craig Moffett So interesting. So actually tiering up customers instead of tiering them down?  Thomas Rutledge Yes, which has been our history by the way. Our tendency is to sell rich products in a bundle and make the whole value of the bundle competitive. Compelling is a better word. So your video, your data and your voice and soon to be your mobile will all be combined in a way that you\'re better off. And people want everything. Craig Moffett When you think about your broadband business and you\'re naturally selling broadband to bundled customers. But as customers cut the cord, there\'s a pricing opportunity in readjusting the total value of the relationship to sort of preserve economics. How do you think about the price value equation of the broadband? Thomas Rutledge It is interesting, I want my broadband-only customers to be video, to be everything. I want to give them as much of a reason to be my customer as possible. And again, back to giving them as much value as I can give them and still be profitable. So a couple of 25%, 30% of our broadband-only customers are satellite customers. Craig Moffett Is it really that low? I would have thought it was higher. Thomas Rutledge It used to be half, but we\'ve been growing that category fairly rapidly. Craig Moffett So they would seem like a pretty obvious target.  Thomas Rutledge They are, but all satellite-only customers, of all the cohorts we market to, they are the most responsive. I mean, data-only. Craig Moffett Yeah sorry. Thomas Rutledge All data only customer are the most responsive customer base we have to marketing. Craig Moffett Interesting. Thomas Rutledge Yes, if I send a video promotion out, send it to nonsubs, send it to any cohort you want. Craig Moffett And do you know which of those are satellite customers and which of those are genuine customers? Thomas Rutledge Yeah pretty much. Craig Moffett Fairly good data on it. And so tell me more about this responsiveness to marketing. Is it different in the satellite customers? Are the satellite customers just ready for a different answer? Or is it the customers who don\'t have any MVPD are ready to be marketed a better video solution? Or that... Thomas Rutledge Particularly, the customers that have no MVPD, they are the most responsive to buying MVPD services. Now if you think about cable, and you think about churn, and you think about seasonality, and you think about lifestyle changes, people coming in and out of the household, college kids returning, all of the things that happen in life that cause subscription levels to change, and there are a lot of them. They\'re less volatile in the data-only space.  But the volatility in video still remains. It\'s higher. And so you have people coming in and out of the category of video, but they stay data-only, while they\'re coming in and out based on – I lived in Maine for a while, and in the summer in Maine, everyone went to camp. And with camp, it could be a lean to or it could be a house, but it was – you leave your winter house and just be outdoors for the three weeks of summer. And people would turn off their cable and People turn off their cable for parts of the year.  Craig Moffett They turn off their video. So you\'re saying less so their broadband. Thomas Rutledge Less so their broadband, right. So you have that volatility inside. The video volatility is always existing in the business. So that\'s why it is – what it means is that the broadband business is a highly stable business.  Craig Moffett So now more prosaically for a second, the softness that we saw in the Time Warner legacy footprint in video and in broadband, it was broadband, still grew but not at quite the same rate. Can you talk about that a little bit? How closer are we to the end of that? That\'s largely, as I understand it, the legacy of the Time Warner Cable promotional pricing just before the deal closed. Thomas Rutledge Time Warner wanted to make a video number, and there were data packages that were discounted that cost less if you took video than if you didn\'t. And a lot of those were churning out. And a lot of them were basic-only. So on the margin, at the end – in the last year, I think they were selling 40% of their connects as basic-only. Craig Moffett May be not losing much when you lose one of those customers?  Thomas Rutledge No and we are actually transforming them through a marketing strategy. We don\'t take our existing customer base and say, "You have to change." You can keep your package whatever it is. What we do, though, is start marketing a high-value product package, the triple-play that we offer, set some branded package, and people move into it. But it takes time to move them into it, and they move in at their own pace. And the value of that package is relative to what they were getting before. The other thing that\'s going on in the Time Warner business, which was the biggest single – it\'s actually physically and financially the biggest single piece of our P&L now, is that there were 90,000 different promotional offers. And they – and many of them were deeply discounted, and they were also piled on top of each other.  Craig Moffett How did I not get one of those, by the way? Thomas Rutledge You had to call in. It was a Turkish bazaar. You\'d call in, bargain, you come up, and there would have been a package. And so there\'s a lot of that out there. And if you – and they\'re also exploding packages. Meaning, at the end of the term, they go back to full price. Craig Moffett And generate a lot of call. Thomas Rutledge And generate a lots of – yes, a lot of calls and big rate increases. And we, up until recently, were unable to see that or intervene in that prior to it happening. So that was one of the downsides of lack of visibility into the billing systems and all that sort of things in-house. Craig Moffett So how close are we to the end of working through all of that kind of more at? Thomas Rutledge We’ve already turned the corner in terms of unit growth. And we are selling more on a year-over- year basis than we were. Craig Moffett So the second quarter is always seasonally weak, but.. Thomas Rutledge Day by day, year-over-year we are better already. Now it is going to take… Craig Moffett That is within the Time Warner footprint? Or is it the whole company?  Thomas Rutledge And the whole company. Craig Moffett There is a lot of runway left in Time Warner for raising speed. The last quarter\'s 43% are at 60 megabits per second and higher. How quickly do you get that ramped that you get people on the speeds that are really differentiated?  Thomas Rutledge Pretty quickly. I think if you look at where we first did new product and pricing in Time Warner, like Los Angeles with first market, 34% of the customer base was already on the new pricing and packaging. And so about half the country right now has an offer in front of them of 100 megabits and standard package and about half at 60. And I think that\'ll get closer to the majority being 100 as we move through time.  We\'ve held some back just to – as we cleared broadband base Spectrum, but our package is rich everywhere we offer the product now. So it\'s just really a question of marketing our way through the legacy customer base. And we do that in a deliberate way, and we do it in a voluntary way, meaning the customer has to buy or – so we don\'t force upgrade them. Craig Moffett Is there a point at which fast enough is fast enough? I mean, is there any sign of speed exhaustion in your customer base? Thomas Rutledge Speed exhaustion? Well, maybe there should be, but there doesn\'t – there isn\'t. We have a pathway to get to 10 gig symmetrical. Craig Moffett Yes. So talk about that. Talk about DOCSIS 3.2 and what you see coming. Thomas Rutledge Yes. So we have some 3.1 DOCSIS deployed already experimentally. Most of our network infrastructure, all of the big metal in the network is 3.1 already. So – and the modems are going to price pretty much like existing modems, sub-$50 kind of modem pricing. So it\'s – it could be rapidly deployed. The question is, so what? Is 100 – is a gig better than 100 in a practical way? It isn\'t today, unless you\'re a business or you have some unusual use pattern. But it will be. I\'m convinced that the data usage trends that we\'ve seen for a decade will continue, and that we will ultimately stand up virtual-reality products that are extremely bandwidth-intensive. And I think our infrastructure is suited to do that better than any infrastructure there is. I think if you think about what that world would look like, millimeter wave technology or small cell technology or Wi-Fi technology, which is also capable of multi-gig speeds on a road map, it\'s an in-home product or an in-office product where massive speeds can – and latency can be delivered into creating whole new products in whole new ways of living that are hard to explain. But I\'m convinced it is the reality of our digital future. Craig Moffett And I’m guessing – and your infrastructure is better positioned for that. Thomas Rutledge I think it is. Craig Moffett So it\'s sort of – it does tee-up an obvious question, which is, historically, you\'ve always driven volumes more than price. Your preference has always been I\'d rather maximize. Thomas Rutledge I like them all. I like it all. Craig Moffett So think about the... Thomas Rutledge Question is what\'s the best… Craig Moffett So yes, so talk about that a little bit. How is your – what\'s your current thinking about price and volume as the two levers in your business? Thomas Rutledge We\'ve been growing at 5%, 6% customer relationship with a couple of points of rate in there. And some of it\'s step-up – most of it\'s step-up rate where people buying the promotions, and then they self-increase – they increase their rates in agreed upon rate plan as part of the promotional pricing. And so you can get 8% kind of revenue growth out of that. And in a world where you\'re improving the quality of your service and increasing the life of your customers by increasing their satisfaction, which is related to rate, you extend life that takes – that reduces transactions per dollar of revenue, which reduces cost per dollar of revenue. So you get a larger EBITDA growth in percentage terms than your revenue growth with a highly satisfied customer base. And so there\'s an art in there, deciding what the right price step-ups ought to be and what the product valuation is from a consumer experience perspective and how that translates into word-of-mouth and market share growth. So I can\'t tell you that – I know the theory behind it, but I don\'t know where all the number points – where all the points are. So you feel your way around in there. I\'ve got a model that works pretty well for creating value. Craig Moffett And it\'s fair to say you still think there\'s an awful lot of penetration ramp left in there that... Thomas Rutledge Yes, I do. I think – we\'re 50% share on data – excuse me and about 50% share on MVPD. So yes, I think there\'s a lot of ramp. And I think the data, high-speed data business can grow as a category, still. Craig Moffett Yes, it\'s about 77% penetrated or something nationally. Thomas Rutledge Yes. So I think that could step in the low 90s. Craig Moffett Okay. One business where you still got happily reasonably low penetration is your commercial services business where you still have a lot of runway in front of you. Thomas Rutledge Yes, under 10% there. Probably it\'s $20 billion. Well, I break that into two categories: enterprise and SMB. Craig Moffett And SMB, you\'re probably, what, 20% share? Thomas Rutledge Probably, yes. And I\'m not sure exactly, but in that range. Craig Moffett And – but your growth decelerated a bit at – in the Time Warner side, at least. Is that a function of – is that the repricing that you stepped down prices and accelerated it? Because we don\'t get to see the unit number... Thomas Rutledge Yes, you don\'t. Oh, I thought we… Craig Moffett Well, you have the – you have units for the traditional measures. But particularly, as you get into the enterprise, how big the ticket... Thomas Rutledge Yes, I agree it\'s hard to look at. It\'s even hard to look at internally because they\'re all odd products. Craig Moffett Yes. Thomas Rutledge So putting – so we have two strategies that are related. But when we look at SMB, we think, gee, this business looks a lot like residential. You can standardize it. You can go for volume. We can get all of the economies of volume and scale if you put the business in the right model. And so we repriced the business, and we are generating significantly more unit growth. And that unit growth will translate into market share, and it will translate into higher revenue growth than we had prior to the price reduction market share strategy change. It just takes some time. Craig Moffett And so – and how long is that transition period of... Thomas Rutledge Well, we did it at Charter previously. Craig Moffett And as I recall, just a couple of quarters. It was actually quite fast. Thomas Rutledge Well, it\'s more than – it\'s a year. Well, I don\'t look at it in quarter terms. Craig Moffett But yes – but it\'s – but in another call, it went quite quickly of there\'s some pressure on pricing, and then there\'s a reacceleration out of that. Thomas Rutledge There is pricing – yes. So what happens is your incremental units are coming in at a lower rate, right? And so your revenue growth slows. But they pile up, and they stay longer, and you get more of them, and then you have a bigger number. Craig Moffett Is there a law of large numbers, though? When you\'re – you\'re talking about a big… Thomas Rutledge We’ve seen a lot of system. Craig Moffett No. Your growth rate right now is $1 billion a year of new growth in commercial or getting close to it. Is it hard to extract the extra $1 billion out of a segment like that every year? That\'s a big number. Thomas Rutledge Yes, those are big markets. And yes, the answer is yes. Craig Moffett Yes, it\'s harder. Yes, you\'re getting that... Thomas Rutledge It\'s hard, but we can do it. The enterprise space is just a big business, and our footprint is $20 billion. And we\'ve got less than a $2 billion business. And so it\'s – there\'s a lot of upside. Craig Moffett And do you get a different competitive response as you just get to that size and the telcos start to feel the pain more viscerally? Thomas Rutledge We\'ll see, but yes, it\'s a response of market. But we can stand up much greater speeds in more places than most legacy phone companies and particularly more than legacy phone customers are paying for and getting in their existing product set. And it\'s difficult to take that copper product and turn it off, just knock the price down because even knocking the price down doesn\'t improve the speed experience and all of that. So I think we have a good – we have a better physical asset in most locations where we compete. Craig Moffett I probably could have started this conversation with wireless, and some would say I probably should have since I spent – I started AT&T with the video business. Talk about the – you said 2018 for your wireless launch for the MVNO. Does your agreement with Comcast change the timing of that at all?  Thomas Rutledge No. Our agreement with them on the MVNO is to explore opportunities together. We have the same MVNO. It\'s with the same company. And so we\'re proceeding, and we\'re proceeding to launch in 2018 regardless of our relationship with them. But there are opportunities for us to do the same things and for us to learn what they\'ve already learned and to make them efficient and to make us efficient. And we agreed to explore what those opportunities might be, things like buying handsets, things like using provisioning systems and billing interface systems, software systems that are common, so that you\'d have interoperability, in certain cases, using Wi-Fi together, using our Wi-Fi platforms in ways that would enhance the value of our product. We didn\'t agree to do any of that. We agreed to explore that. Craig Moffett Okay. Is it – so they bought Spectrum in the auction, and it seems like their model is going to be coverage canopy layer for when you\'re in your car on a highway or what have you, and then a real capacity layer that you and they will have in a similar model of probably Wi-Fi, maybe it evolves to millimeter wave or something eventually out of home. Is that the right way to think about it? And how does the fact that you don\'t have that coverage layer and that you didn\'t get capacity in the Spectrum, how does that change – or Spectrum in the auction, how does that change the way you think about the economics of that business? Thomas Rutledge Well, first, you should talk to them about why they bought the 600 megahertz Spectrum and where that is. I actually don\'t even know. I would – would I bid on it? I was in a very difficult situation with the deal pending. I couldn\'t bid on it if I wanted to. A couple of times I tried to talk to Tom Wheeler into being easier on me if I would bid on it, too, but that was to no avail. And so the MVNO is a 4G MVNO and with follow-on technology, so it can be whatever future products there are. With regard to owners economics and owning a cellular network or component pieces of it, there may be opportunities to do that. One, you can think of the Wi-Fi network as a wireless network already. In our company, we have 200 million devices connected to our network today. We are a wireless company. In fact, almost all of the bits that we send are sent wirelessly. And almost all – and 75% of the bits that go to T-Mobile\'s phones or Sprint\'s phones or AT&T\'s phones or Verizon\'s phones come through a Wi-Fi network, not through a cellular network. Because if you think about bit utilization and future bit growth, it\'s sedentary kind of bit utilizations, movies and video and maybe 4G in the future. And that requires a small cell architecture, which we already have in the home. And we can take that architecture up and take the speeds up dramatically. So do you need boomer frequencies like 600 megahertz? You do if you\'re in the mobile business and if you\'re a mobile wireless operator. And so there\'s – to me, there\'s a difference... Craig Moffett As opposed to a stationary wireless. Thomas Rutledge Correct. So most of the bits today are stationary wireless. Craig Moffett But is that a viable long-term segmentation? Or does a customer, even if they\'re stationary 90% of the time, that 10% of the time is still going to be really important… Thomas Rutledge It\'s important. Yes. So it\'s an MVNO, hence, the ability – why we want to have a mobile product. The question is, how do you – how much owners economics do you need? How much of the total network experience is mobile? How much of that should you own or not own? Craig Moffett And is it fair? I\'ve always characterized it as ultimately, the end game of the MVNO is that it starts to look more and more like an in-region roaming agreement and less like a traditional MVNO. And that you\'re not outsourcing the whole customer experience. You\'re outsourcing what is effectively mid-band Spectrum at that point. Thomas Rutledge That\'s one way of thinking about it, yes, I mean, to the MVNO, but most of the relationship won\'t be there. Craig Moffett Okay. So you will own the customer relationship and the billing systems and all that sort of things in-house? Thomas Rutledge That’s right. Craig Moffett There\'s – the carriers are all talking – the wireless carriers, they\'re all talking about network densification as sort of item number one strategically. What role do you think you play in that? Do you think you are an arms dealer of infrastructure to support all those cells? Are you a competitor to those players as they densify? How do you think about that Thomas Rutledge Generally, I think of myself as a competitor, a long-run competitor. And we\'re already pretty dense. We\'re dense, and we\'re not – and what we don\'t have is the wide. Craig Moffett If that model is – is your HSE architecture, I guess, a different way to put it, is your HSE architecture the right architecture for small cells? And if you view the wireless operators as competitors, does that suggest that, ultimately, that\'s a network you\'re building for yourself? Thomas Rutledge Well, our network is for ourself and our customers, and that\'s the way we look at our network. It\'s our primary asset, and it\'s our primary differentiator. And we\'re in a competitive world. And people can stand up other kinds of architectures to compete with us and do the same things as us, but it\'s expensive and maybe not as good, I hope. So I look at myself as a long-run competitor. I\'m trying to make strategic moves for the long run, so that I can end up with the customers. I think our network itself is a small cell network already. The question of whether you want to use small cells for mobile is, to me, the question. You could also use them for fixed broadband replacement, I guess, although I think that\'s a very expensive. Craig Moffett And obviously, not something that\'s interesting to you because you already have them... Thomas Rutledge I have it already, yes. If you think about some of that wireless drops, there are technical circumstances where small cell fixed point-to-point wireless would work for us in enterprise, for instance, getting to billings, accessing physical locations where there\'s no connectivity. But generally, we have connectivity. Connectivity, we have a high-capacity pipe all the way into that radio in the house, which we can enhance. And we have a pathway to get to 10 gig symmetrical. So we have – we don\'t need wireless drops. And do you need small cells for mobility? And even when you think about mobility as a business, and you think about 5G, or you think about products that might exist in a high-capacity, low-latency world like some virtual-reality product, is that a mobile product? And would you build a small cell mobile network outside, so that people could ride around in their cars in virtual reality? Or will 4G be a mobile platform for that part of your life that you need a pretty high capacity mobile platform, but not where you\'d go for some kinds of… Craig Moffett Well, I do certainly think that a 5G network is still a – there\'s a real question about what do you use it for and what is the business case. Thomas Rutledge Yes. So that\'s – so I don\'t know the answers to those questions, but I think our architecture lends itself to answering those questions better than any other architecture. Craig Moffett Well, it brings me to the popular Game of Thrones game that everybody is playing at this conference for the next few days. M&A, everybody wants to think about every combination. John Malone pointedly talked about how cool it would be to see wireless and cable combined. Thomas Rutledge John likes M&A. Craig Moffett Talk about – talk about the logic of combination of preexisting assets. So an existing cable operator with an existing wireless operator. Is that – do you see the logic behind that? Thomas Rutledge Yes, but I don\'t know that it\'s necessary. I mean, I think all of the things I just said about how you can use an MVNO and what a 4G network is and how that\'s combined with the kinds of capacities we already have makes it feasible not to have one. Now at the right price and the right owners economics, would it pay to have your own network? Maybe. But I don\'t think it\'s a foregone conclusion that you have to. Craig Moffett And any – you want to expand at all on the right price and the right economics, what the... Thomas Rutledge No, I\'m not going to get – try to say the market price. Craig Moffett John has also talked about – talks favorably about the combination of content and distribution. That\'s something that\'s always been near and dear to him. But do you see the value of vertical integration into content? Thomas Rutledge There are some advantages to having it, I guess. But there are disadvantages, too, in scale, the natural scale issues in the content business. In order to have – if you think about AT&T buying Time Warner, and are they going to turn Charter into a AT&T exclusive product or HBO? Probably not because the value of those businesses would be 3/4 less than they are and what they\'re paying for, right? Craig Moffett Yes. Thomas Rutledge So you need a national business, which means you have to have relationships with distribution, and you have to run it as a programming business. It\'s hard to run it for your own internal purposes. And so I see that as a fundamental issue with owning content. But I think NBC went to Comcast at a very good price, and it\'s a very good asset, and maybe very – and they\'ll do well with it because of what they paid for.  Craig Moffett But that\'s different than saying there is compelling vertical synergies. It\'s just that was a good asset that they bought at a good price. Thomas Rutledge I think that’s right. Craig Moffett Okay. Thomas Rutledge I mean, they may argue that differently, but I – that\'s what I think. Craig Moffett And lastly, horizontal consolidation. Do you think there\'s any more room for horizontal consolidation in the cable industry? Or have we come to the bigger. Thomas Rutledge There isn\'t that much left, but I love the cable assets and think they\'re good. And I think that there are platform economics by integrating. And so if they were available, they would be interesting to me. Craig Moffett As a place to wrap up then, given all of that, how do you think about your long-term balance sheet and capital deployment? Where are your priorities? Thomas Rutledge Well, it hasn\'t really changed. If we can invest in the business, we will. And if we can find M&A that\'s accretive, we will. And if we can\'t do any of that, we can buy back our stock. We bought a couple of billion dollars back in the last couple of quarters. And the company is set up, from a balance sheet perspective, quite well. I expect it to grow and increase EBITDA, and I expect capital intensity to come down and... Craig Moffett How low? Thomas Rutledge Lower. And I mean, it\'s high now because of the integration, duplicate costs. But it comes down. I mean, you just saw it was coming down at legacy Charter. You saw what legacy Cablevision did. It comes down and should come down. It comes down for a lot of – and technology is bringing it down. So even if it goes up, capital intensity comes down, interest costs, we\'ve got a really nice fixed interest portfolio with low equal towers out for a long period of time. So we\'re very liquid from a EBITDA to interest rate. I think we\'ve got a $2 billion interest rate budget and a – and if you take capital, if we ever had any kind of liquidity issues, we have huge capital budgets that can be managed. So we\'ve got a very secure debt structure, and we have the ability to throw enormous free cash flow in the future. And I think that\'s a good business. Question-and-Answer Session Q -  Craig Moffett I think there\'s a lot of people in the room that would agree with you. So Tom, thank you very much for joining us, and I look forward to having you back for a 5th next year. Thomas Rutledge All right. Thank you.

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. And we will open the floor your questions and comments following the presentation.  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, David Mangum. Sir, the floor is yours.  Dave Mangum   Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today on the call is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Pete Kight. Before we start, please note that some of the statements we will make today will be not historical, but rather forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements reflect management\'s intentions, plans, beliefs, expectations, or projections of the future; however, CheckFree\'s actual results may differ from these current expectations. Forward-looking statements involve various risks and uncertainties, including those inherent in our business and others that we detail from time to time in our publicly-filed reports and press releases, including the press release issued earlier today and furnished on a Form 8-K.  Our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, filed February 8, 2007, our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, filed November 8, 2006, and our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, filed September 8, 2006, particularly the section titled "Risk Factors." Please note that in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Securities and Exchange Commission requirements CheckFree publicly discloses all financial results using generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  However, in today\'s call, we will also discuss our non-GAAP performance measures of underlying net income, underlying earnings per share, and free cash flow. Our underlying numbers in free cash flow are reconciled to their appropriate GAAP equivalents on Attachments A and B in our press release, which were distributed today at 4:00 p.m. Please reference Attachments A and B of our press release for additional reconciliation details. These materials are also are available in the Investor Center section of our website at Checkfreecorp.com.  For the quarter ended March 31, on a GAAP basis, our consolidated revenue was $230.2 million. GAAP net income for the quarter was $30 million, or $0.33 per share. During the quarter, we recorded an $11 million charge reducing revenue for the fair value of $1 million performance-based warrants earned by a customer under the terms of their agreement.  Excluding the impact of these warrants, our underlying revenue was $241.2 million, reflecting 6% growth over the third quarter last year. Underlying net income for the quarter was $44 million, or $0.49 per share. Free cash flow for the quarter was $57.5 million.  And now I would like to turn the call over to Pete Kight. Pete?

During this quarter, we saw expected increases in core bank-based consumer service provider transactions, and continued to see good core increases in accounts under management within investment services. However, our software business fell short in sales execution within the Software Division, so that\'s where I\'ll begin the discussion.  In the Software Division, contract sales in the quarter were lower than expected. The under performance was due to missed or delayed software license sales, with a smaller miss domestically, and larger miss in our international operations. I describe it as a mix of execution following off in the midst of the Carreker acquisition and some weakness in our international unit that we\'ve already taken steps to address. However, we won\'t be able to prevent this under performance from affecting the Company\'s previously stated full-year expectations, on which Dave will have additional color in a few minutes.  The Software Division\'s going to benefit from the integration of the Carreker products and the increase in scale. Carreker provides us with a suite of software products that will fill in the biggest gaps in providing banks with a cost efficient and faster capability to optimize the payments channel.  The banking industry now has enough new electronic payment and settlement products that the back end complexity is becoming problematic for corporate customers. Corporate banking needs a solution for this convergence of payment types within the existing bank back end infrastructure.  We aren\'t going to sell as many point products going forward without solving this complexity, and that\'s exactly what CheckFree and Carreker\'s existing and upcoming product set are going to do. We think we can provide a cost effective solution that is better than anyone.  Integrating this product set, we can deliver a pragmatic and logical approach to payments convergence that leverages a financial institution\'s, the existing significant core processing investments, rather than reinventing or replacing those systems. We\'ll have a systematic enterprise wide approach that is cost justified and can be deployed in less time and with less integration and customization. We\'ve closed the deal earlier this month, and we\'re hard at work in getting to market and getting our focus back on execution in Software.  Moving now on to Electronic Commerce. During the third quarter, our Electronic Commerce Division processed $340.9 million transactions, representing overall 6% sequential quarterly growth. Of the total transactions processed for the quarter, $269.6 million were CSP-based transactions, which represents a 7% quarterly increase within our banking customer base, and a $71.2 million non-CSP transaction flow, which represents a 1% quarterly increase.  We met our quarterly expectations on CSP, or bank-based transactions growth, and continue on track to meet the full-year expectations for this metric, as well. On the sales side, we saw fewer sales than expected for some new non-transaction products. As we previously discussed, we expect to incorporate most of these types of products into our Internet banking technology platform, post closing of the Corillian acquisition.  We plan to expand the Corillian Internet banking platform to include an increasingly flexible and higher value integrated online banking services set. We currently expect the acquisition to close during the fourth quarter, pending required regulatory and Corillian shareholder approval.  As a heads up for future segment reporting purposes, the Carreker acquisition will also have an impact on our Electronic Commerce Division as the revenue enhancement, or what we call RevE, portion of Carreker will report into the Electronic Commerce Division going forward. RevE, which represents about 30% of Carreker, is a consulting and services line of business that provides significant profitability enhancement to retail banking operations. We intend to build upon this platform and expect to substantially expand RevE as we make it a part of our EC banking business.  Before I move on, I also want to comment on a recent announcement we made in response to queries we received about a large bank client considering in-sourcing portions of our end-to-end electronic billing and payment service. That competitive dynamic is well known in this market, and we\'ve talked about it for quite a while.  We\'ve increasingly added flexibility and enhanced value within our systems so we can be competitive to win and to manage our costs at service level shift, whether in-house or vertically. We\'ve also, however, been consistent at the same time in noting that we do not disclose our client banks proprietary plans or information. If we have a material event to disclose, we\'ll, of course, do so.  Turning to Investment Services. In our Investment Services Division, the accounts on our system stood at more than $2.6 million through the end of the third quarter. This represents good growth in our core accounts. Our account total was affected by the expected migration of some high volume, low-priced reporting only accounts from one specific client, but overall this represents a healthy quarter for managed account growth. We continue on track with our multi-year investment in CheckFree EPL, the next generation account management platform.  Our Q3 results, along with the work we\'ll undertake during Q4 to ensure successful integration of our closed and pending acquisitions, are the key components to our updated full-year expectations.  For more on that, we\'ll go back to Dave, who will provide detail on the quarter\'s financial results and a look ahead to Q4 and the year. Dave?  Dave Mangum   Thanks, Pete. I\'ll describe our performance in the third quarter, discuss the manner in which we will report revenue for software acquisitions, and review fourth quarter and full-year financial expectations, both with and without Carreker. For the third quarter, transaction growth remained on track in Electronic Commerce with CSP quarterly transaction growth of more than 7%. Revenue per transaction declined by $0.01 to $0.45. Our non-CSP transactions grew by 1%. Revenue per non-CSP transaction increased to $0.56, driven by higher priced phone payment transactions.  Within Software, both license and related professional services revenue declined in the quarter. Lower than expected sales resulted in a drop in the division operating margin to the mid-teens. We generated $57.5 million of free cash flow in the third quarter. Given the pending acquisitions of Carreker and Corillian, we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter.  During the quarter, as well, one of our bank customers achieved $5 million active electronic bill pay users, resulting in the vesting of $1 million warrants to purchase CheckFree stock at a stock price of $32.50 per share.  We determined the fair value of the warrants at the vesting date to be approximately $11 million. Accounting rules, chiefly EITF 96-18 and EITF 01-09, require us to recognize the charge as a non-cash reduction to GAAP revenue in Q3. We have excluded this non-cash charge from our reported underlying revenue.  Turning now to software acquisition reporting. As I mentioned during our January conference call, accounting rules associated with the valuation of deferred revenue assumed in the acquisition of a software company will require us to discount the value of deferred revenue on Carreker\'s closing balance sheet, significantly reducing the revenue we will record on a GAAP basis during the first year of the acquisition.  As a result, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we expect to reduce our GAAP revenue and operating profit by approximately $12 million. This reduction has no impact on cash flow. After discussing approaches for clearly reporting the revenue results of the Carreker acquisition with a number of experienced software industry investors, we believe the industry preference is for us to add this revenue back to our underlying financial results.  This approach is consistent with software industry reporting practices, and we believe it will provide more clarity to investors as to the core financial performance and cash flow characteristics of the acquired company. We will, of course, reconcile our GAAP and underlying revenue in all of our reporting. We expect to follow the same approach for Corillian.  Now for core CheckFree for fiscal 2007, excluding the impact of Carreker. We now expect lower sales in our Software Division and limited new product sales in electronic commerce. We also now expect the migration of two new bank customers to be delayed into early fiscal 2008.  As a result, we now expect underlying EPS of $1.86 to $1.88, GAAP EPS of $1.46 to $1.48, and free cash flow of about $190 million. Again, these expectations exclude Carreker.  In Electronic Commerce, for our CSP transactions, we continue to anticipate nearly 25% annual growth overall resulting from transaction growth of 25% to 30% from our broad CSP channel, and a lower growth rate from our largest customer. For our other bill payment channels, we continue to expect transactions to modestly decline for fiscal 2007. In total, we continue to expect overall transaction growth in the mid-teens.  Turning more specifically to the fourth quarter. In line with our models for cyclical transaction growth patterns, we are projecting sequential transaction growth from the CSP channel of 1% to 3%, and a negative 3% to negative 1% change in non-CSP transactions for a combined total transaction growth of 0% to 2%.  In Software, we expect a solid fourth quarter for license revenue, but we do not expect sales to be as strong as our previous expectations. Within Investment Services, we expect consistent portfolio growth and relatively strong consulting revenue in the fourth quarter.  Overall, we expect total company revenues in the range of $245 to $250 million on both a GAAP and underlying basis for the fourth quarter. We expect underlying earnings per share in the range of $0.48 to $0.50, and GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.40 to $0.42, all of this before the addition of Carreker.  So for Carreker in the fourth quarter, we expect underlying revenue of $24 million to $26 million, in dilution of $0.02 to $0.03 per share on an underlying basis. Nearly $0.02 of this Q4 dilution comes from interest expense on our revolving line of credit, which we expect to pay off in the fourth quarter, and interest income foregone.  Based on our current purchase accounting estimates, which we will true up for fiscal yearend reporting, we expect Carreker to add between $12 and $14 million of GAAP revenue, and be about $0.14 to $0.15 dilutive to earnings per share on a GAAP basis.  In total then, including Carreker, we expect underlying revenue of $269 million to $276 million, and underlying earnings per share of $0.45 to $0.48 in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, including Carreker, we expect revenue of $257 to $264 million, and earnings per share of $0.25 to $0.28.  For the full year, then, including Carreker, we expect earnings per share of $1.83 to $1.86 on an underlying basis, and EPS of $1.31 to $1.34 on a GAAP basis, and free cash flow of about $185 million. None of these expectations include any impact from the Corillian acquisition.  Now I\'ll turn it back to Pete for some closing comments. Pete?  Pete Kight   So while the company executed well on most core business lines, I am obviously not pleased that we missed our sales targets in Software and new product sales in Electronic Commerce. We\'ve already taken aggressive action on both fronts.  In Software, we\'ve reorganized our international sales management and brought in highly experienced international software sales leadership. The Carreker acquisition significantly strengthens the breadth of our global payments product line and adds proven sales capabilities in the U.K., Australia and Europe.  Based on the early reception we\'re receiving from the banking industry on our proposed combined line of software and technology tools, and consulting capabilities, we\'re positive on our outlook going forward. That said, we have to improve sales execution in a sure timely delivery of our expanded product line.  In our Electronic Commerce Division, the new product sales are a disappointment. Those products will be better aligned as part of the expected Corillian platform integration. Our forward focus is on vertically integrating electronic banking transaction services with full service Internet banking and using this platform to expand direct profitability for retail financial services clients.  We will continue to utilize our technology and development resources to both lower our operating costs and build extended services capabilities to provide our financial service clients with a broader platform from which to build consumer profits. We believe we have the scale and invested technology value to compete advantageously in the market.  Price will remain a focus for the market, particularly the biggest banks, where the resources and political motivation are the strongest. As paying bills online becomes increasingly pervasive, I think it\'s likely that some clients will take aspects of these operations in-house over the next several years.  It\'s also very likely we\'ll win new business in the same time frame. We\'ve been consistent in pointing out the different components of what CheckFree provides in electronic billing and payment are separable.  In the near future, as we add Internet banking components and integrate additional higher value service components, the service and technology levels that banks choose from CheckFree will vary even more greatly. I believe CheckFree will be well positioned to manage this required flexibility.  Investment Services\' new EPL platform is designed to give us similar flexibility to reduce operating costs as it scales, and to provide significantly greater and higher value vertical service integration for the managed accounts market.  On another note, we\'ve been asked several times if our recent acquisitions are driven by a concern that the market in electronic banking, in particular, is slowing down. The evidence we have is that consumers are, in fact, increasingly committed to leaving paper and manual process in preference for electronically managing their finances.  We think with better services, easier onboarding, transaction services, integrated seamlessly with core information and customer care, that consumers will expand their online usage. That is, however, a service that is primarily being given away by banks right now, and we are in a cycle where banks are highly focused on near-term costs, so getting banks to do development work is tough right now.  The banks aren\'t going to increase their budgets right now to build these advanced services, so we are going to take the lead in building them. We believe we can increase the profitability of online banking for our clients even as we continue helping them reduce costs. We don\'t see a slowdown cycle in consumer behavior.  We do expect bank marketing to remain reduced in this area for the next 12 months. If we can prove increased profitability for online services for our banks, we can reverse that by showing a directly positive ROI for promoting their online services.  Right now, we need to hit our acquisition integration targets, and we need to improve our execution from sales through to implementation. We like our market position, and we believe we have ample room to grow.  That concludes the prepared remarks. Operator, we\'ll open up for questions.  Question-and-Answers Session   Operator   Thank you, Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Elizabeth Grausam. Your line is live.  Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs   This is Julio sitting in for Liz. A quick question on the sales numbers. Do you have any sense of when the E-Commerce sales and the Software sales are going to recover, are you going to see a pick up in 2008?  Dave Mangum   I think a couple of answers to that question. In terms of software, directly in reverse order, we don\'t expect to pick the sales back up in Q4. We do expect the same customers to perhaps close over the course of 2008, but we\'ll stick with where we are in fiscal 2007.  We\'re not going to close the same deals. I think the key to the EC new sales lies in the comments Pete made about the integration of the technology platform from online banking through electronic billing and payment and delivering those additional product sets through that strategy.  Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs   Thank you. And given that Corillian is going to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, are you anticipating any share repurchase in the fourth quarter?  Dave Mangum   Right now as we look out at taking on the cost of closing that acquisition, no, I am not anticipating any share repurchases in Q4.  Julio Quinteros - Goldman Sachs   Okay. Thank you very much.  Dave Mangum   Thank you.  Operator   Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey. Your line is live.  Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey   Hi, good afternoon. I would like to dig in a little bit more around E-Commerce sales. It sounds like part of what you\'re saying is that the disappointing E-Commerce sales is a function of cyclicality, but given the volatility in sequential transaction growth we\'ve seen this year, and then now your view that sales are going to be slower, I mean, what are the odds that what we\'re seeing is a secular shift in bank demand, and/or a change in consumer behavior such that the consolidator model is no longer in the ascendancy, and in fact we\'re going to see transaction growth as a function of slower E-Commerce sales drift from the mid-20s or on the CSP side down to the teens and so forth, I mean, just how do we get conviction that we\'re not seeing this market rolling over on a secular basis?  Pete Kight   So I would separate those out in fairly straightforward fashion. I think the secular view is best served by following the transaction flow, which represents consumers both coming online and processing transactions, and I would describe that growth as right on target.  In terms of the new product sales that we\'re behind, they actually have very little to do, they actually have nothing to do with consumer acceptance. They\'re 100% have to do with us being able to sell new products through the banking channel.  And of the six new products that we introduced over the last two quarters, one is clear success. That\'s one that we\'ll continue to run fully in its existing form, although we\'ll obviously try to add to it with ongoing expanded strategy. That\'s our fraud net capability.  Four of the remaining five are all products that we wanted to sell as higher cost add-ons to increase value that banks would provide through their platform to their customers, and in all four of those cases, the banks either weren\'t interested in adding cost to the platform, or they weren\'t interested in our sales people\'s approach to it.  All of those products are currently either already integrated in a part of the Corillian platform, or we had already begun working on plans to be able to integrate them in. So in all of those cases I would say it\'s clearly a case of the banks not wanting to spend additional money, and have to spend additional integration costs in getting these products online with their customer base. They are all bank-based decisions, not consumer acceptance decisions.  That said, it\'s clearly a part of the cyclicality of the banking industry. There\'s no question the banking industry right now is notably more focused on near-term costs, even when we can point out what we think is a pretty solid ROI on a new consumer product. There are tight budgets out there, and we have to got to sell through those.  Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey   Maybe I don\'t understand your business as well as I thought I did. When I look specifically at CSP transactions, I think about those being driven by an installed base of online banking, bill pay financial institutions, your CSP channel.  It almost sounds, Pete, as though you\'re beginning to tie the growth rate and transactions to your ability to sell some of these other products. Am I hearing you say that, or are we still talking about two sort of intrinsically different things. On the one hand, bill pay revenue is being driven by transactions and these ancillary sales of other e-commerce functionality?  Pete Kight   It\'s a fair complexity. They are two very separate, I would say, market lines, but I wouldn\'t say that they are not related. Clearly, we don\'t believe that bill payment, stand alone by itself is the long-term product. As you\'ve heard me say for a long time, at minimum the first conceptual stage is bill payment was always electronic billing delivery and payment.  So electronic bill delivery is an integral part of bill payment, although bill payment is clearly more dominant than electronic bill delivery, but the two clearly affect each other, and I would tell you our goal all along has been that within a reasonably short time frame, there isn\'t any difference in our discussion between electronic billing payment. It\'s all part of the same round trip transaction. So even in bill payment, I would argue there\'s a little bit more complexity than just the current transaction flow.  That said, then the other side are these products. To give you an example, the products are things like what we call financial view, which is a budget, for lack of a better term, Quicken light-like product, that is integrated with online banking platform.  We think it is something that is a great value add service for the consumer, and that in fact provides a foothold for us and the providing banks to be able to add on additional new profit point capabilities for additional services. We have small business, which we are continuing to add value to that we believe the banks can charge more for, account to account, open account online, m-commerce, which is the ability to be able to access your home banking and bill pay capability via mobile phone.  Those are all products we thing are important. Those are all products we think that it is important to build vertically into our transaction services, but overall, you now hear me talking about, very clearly, we want to integrate this service capability in with a much deeper and a much more seamless integrated fashion with the core online banking platform itself, so that the information flow from onboarding all the way through information flow usage, service, is all captured, it all becomes part of the whole value added process of providing financial services online at an increasingly better profit point for our bank clients.  So we clearly believe that bill pay transaction is the starting point. What we\'re trying to do is build very directly an increasing profit capability for the overall online platform.  Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey   Okay. Thanks.  Operator   Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang. Your line is live.  Tien-tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan   I guess I\'ll start by asking a question about the legacy full-service bill pay model. I am just trying to -- something maybe, Pete, you can help us unbundle and define the key services that could be separable, I think, as you called it. I think about a payment warehouse, remittance services. front-end user interface, call center, just trying to get a better feel for what exactly is separable under the old full-service model?  Pete Kight   That\'s a pretty good start. You have user interface, which is clearly separable, and in fact today we have a number of banks where we provide what we describe as full service, but we\'re not actually driving the user interface.  You have different components for payment warehouse, means different things to different people, but clearly payment warehouse where the data is actually stored. Can be on a database inside the bank. It can be on a database that’s housed in our infrastructure.  Can be a database the banks build themselves, can be one they buy from us, can be one they buy from us after we close the Corillian deal, can be one they buy from someone else, and the degree with which the service integration between the internal payment warehouse integrates and provides additional services, provides a pretty big, then, I would say path to what the additional separable components are.  Customer care is a very big one. There are several different layers of customer care from us answering the phones for the institution, to us answering the phones only in complex situations, and having the hand-off from the bank, all the way to us providing a full customer care information platform capability, to the banks own customer care reps, all the way us to supplying raw data back to the bank and them performing all of their own customer care.  So those are the separable components today. After the Corillian integration, I think you\'ll see those separable components probably double in terms of number.  Tien-tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan   Right, but when we think about, is there any way we can think about the relative profitability of some of those core services, and maybe the challenge of the in-house versus outsource solution? Obviously, across all payments some pieces are very commoditized and it makes sense to outsource, but others are closer to the core, so just trying to understand sort of the balance between the two sides.  Pete Kight   Yes. So that\'s, of course, a very key question, one that\'s very key to us, because clearly what we would like to drive is, we could would like to drive those separable components that we don\'t think we add a significant or as much value in.  We would like to drive those in-house, we would like to keep the ones that we think we add significant value so we can continue to differentiate. But I wouldn\'t be in a position where I would complicate my negotiations or strategy by sort of publicly isolating those different components.  But I\'m sure you have a reasonable idea of just in going down to those lists, some clearly are reasonable commodities, you combine a number of places. Others, I wouldn\'t underestimate how complex it is to provide something as simple as a customer service transaction when it involves payment, settlement, and clearing.  Tien-tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan   Okay. Fair enough. I guess just to move a little bit away from that, I guess, what\'s driving the delay if the new client conversions on the bill pay front? I didn\'t catch that.  Pete Kight   I think it, again, is a component of the fact this is a very tough budget cycle this year in banking, so there\'s no question that we\'re seeing the things get pushed off as, and we hear a lot from, of course, the people we work with, who have to get this work done on their budgets tightening.  I think we can execute better. You know, we\'ve made changes here, because, quite frankly, I don\'t think we\'re executing as well as we should be. And it\'s really, I think, a combination of those two things.  Tien-tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan   Okay, and if I can just sneak in one more on Carreker. How should we think about the seasonality of that business, and I guess the mix of license and maintenance revenues going forward?  Dave Mangum   Yeah, I think, Tien-tsin, you\'re going to have to let us get started with that business. You\'ll see over time it begin to shape a bit like the seasonality you see in our core software business. It\'s the nature of our fiscal year end, kind of having a calendar year end where our customers have their end of year and then our own June year end.  If you want to look at the components of what makes up sort of underlying revenue as we go forward, think of that as a very small amount of licenses we get started in Q4, and then split maintenance and other revenue, services revenue, as you build your model for this quarter, and we\'ll have more to talk about probably after year end.  Tien-tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan   Thank you.  Dave Mangum   Thanks, Tien-tsin.  Operator   Our next question comes from John Kraft. Your line is live.  John Kraft - D.A. Davidson   Good afternoon, guys. Pete, I just wanted to follow up on a previous question. Is it fair to summarize, you are talking about these add-on products like financial view and some of that. Is it fair to just sort of summarize those value-added services as an offset to some of the organic pricing declines that you\'ve got?  Pete Kight   I take it you didn\'t think I provided a very simple answer to that question, which I have to agree. I wasn\'t impressed with my own simplicity myself. I wouldn\'t argue with that, with saying that\'s part of it.  There\'s no question that we don\'t want to be just a bill pay company, and there\'s no question that electronic bill into payment is a powerful value-add component to the whole online consumer experience, but it\'s one of the components in the online banking experience.  We think the integration between online banking and the transaction services that we supply, and then the information advantages that can be gleaned from being able to deeply integrate those capabilities and build additional products off of both the consumer behavior experience and the information flow we think is a significant opportunity.  You know, no question that I would love to increase the value proposition so that we can both collect more ourselves in creating additional profit capability for the bank. Certainly a part of that strategy would be that would help offset continued declines in pure transaction processing, but I also think it\'s bigger than that, but I wouldn\'t disagree with that being a key component.  John Kraft - D.A. Davidson   Okay. And then can you remind us of the other incremental warrant-related hurdles that your large bank there may achieve at some point?  Dave Mangum   Yes, would be happy to, John. This is Dave again. It\'s at $7.5 million and $10 million active electronic billing and payment users, and it\'s at $5 million electronic bills delivered per month, and $10 million electronic bills delivered per month, each of which -- $1 million warrants is ascribed to each one of those performance milestones.  John Kraft - D.A. Davidson   Okay. And then speaking of the e-bills. Actually in a couple of areas, the e-bills and the non-CSP, your price per transaction was able to move up. Can you talk about what\'s going on there to enable you to raise that price?  Dave Mangum   Yes. It\'s really two slightly different answers. On the non-CSP transactions, it\'s more phone-based payments. Remember, that\'s the telephone and IVR-based payments that often go to credit card. There the price is actually going up.  Some of that is consumer choice, some of that is where the billers are driving those transactions. On the e-bill side, it\'s sort of really mix at the margin more than anything else, John, there\'s no fundamental change in the pattern of the prices in that piece of the business.  John Kraft - D.A. Davidson   Okay. And then some of the other things you\'ve been talking about, like expedited payments, what\'s the status of that?  Dave Mangum   Expedited payments, along with some of the other related initiatives we talked about, are really \'08 deliverables for us, so we\'ll have more to talk about on those as we go forward.  John Kraft - D.A. Davidson   Okay. And then last question about software and the weak margin. Is it fair to say that or, I mean, did you say, I didn\'t hear, that some of those software deals were pushed out and maybe pushed into Q4?  Dave Mangum   Yes, I think some of the deals are indeed pushed out into Q4. In fact, we\'ve closed a couple of them. The challenge we have in Q4 is the sheer volume of closing business, and we don\'t think we\'ll be able to achieve the sales goals we had at the time we last spoke with you guys.  John Kraft - D.A. Davidson   Got it. Thank you, guys.  Dave Mangum   Thank you.  Operator   Our next question is coming from Nik Fisken. Your line is live.  Nik Fisken - Stephens Inc.   Hey, good afternoon, everybody. David, on the $937,000 of integration costs, was that spent on Carreker, and what\'s the outlook for additional costs?  Dave Mangum   That is Carreker. There\'s a tiny amount of Corillian perhaps in there. But that\'s 100% Carreker and the outlook for that is a similar number in Q4 right now, Nik.  Nik Fisken - Stephens Inc.   Will that be it after that?  Dave Mangum   For Carreker, that should be about it. We will have dribs and drabs into fiscal 2008, but as you know, that\'s the year where we begin to turn the pure financial performance around in that piece of the division.  Nik Fisken - Stephens Inc.   And then is Corillian about the same, $1 million for two quarters?  Dave Mangum   We\'ll talk more about Corillian when we close Corillian.  Nik Fisken - Stephens Inc.   Okay. And what exact products were light the Software Division?  Dave Mangum   The products that were light were mostly our operational risk management products, so that was our simply put our reconciliation products, I don\'t want to over simplify, but we were also a little light in securities and a little bit light in I-solutions, the electronic billing software, and it sort of spread evenly across those product lines. We were on target with our global treasury sales for the most part.  Nik Fisken - Stephens Inc.   So is fourth quarter going to be up year-on-year?  Dave Mangum   Is fourth quarter going to be up year-on-year where?  Nik Fisken - Stephens Inc.   In Software.  Dave Mangum   Without Carreker, of course?  Nik Fisken - Stephens Inc.   Right, yes, exactly.  Dave Mangum   Yes, we expect to it be up year-on-year, but at best modestly. It could actually be slightly down year-on-year.  Nik Fisken - Stephens Inc.   Okay. And last question, has BB&T delayed their move date?  Dave Mangum   I think, we certainly would not mention any banks by name. We\'ll stick with we have a couple of banks whose migrations have slipped just a little bit into early fiscal 2008.  Nik Fisken - Stephens Inc.   Great. Thanks so much.  Dave Mangum   Thanks, Nik.  Operator   Our next question comes from Wayne Johnson. Your line is live.  Wayne Johnson - Raymond James & Associates   Yes, good afternoon. I\'ve got a couple of questions here. On the e-commerce division, this is regarding the fiscal third quarter just reported; subscribers were solid above our model. Volumes in line a little better, revenues in line, but operating margins were a little lighter than what we were looking for. Is there a cost of service increase that\'s flowing through e-commerce, and if so, what is driving that?  Dave Mangum   There are a couple things that drive a bit of a point change may be to margin, Wayne, versus your model. In our phone transactions, we did see more credit card interchange expense than we had forecasted. That\'s a little bit of it. In addition, and what we call our customer operations area, we invested a little bit more in parts of the back office there during some of the fundamental reconciliations in the servicing of a couple of our larger customers.  Wayne Johnson - Raymond James & Associates   Some of your larger customers for EBPP or…?  Dave Mangum   Yes, I\'m sorry, Wayne, yes, for electronic billing and payment, exactly.  Wayne Johnson - Raymond James & Associates   Okay. And then would you say that that is going to trail off here, or is that going to be an increase? Should I expect that a permanent increase in that cost going forward?  Dave Mangum   Let me…  Wayne Johnson - Raymond James & Associates   For the back office EBPP? How should I think about that?  Dave Mangum   Yes, what I think about that is in the scheme of the greater division, it\'s a very modest step function, represents an investment we made in Q3. That increase will not recur in Q4. Doesn\'t mean the costs go away, but you won\'t see another X amount of increase happening again in Q4. Does that answer your question?  Wayne Johnson - Raymond James & Associates   Yes, that\'s helpful.  Dave Mangum   Okay.  Wayne Johnson - Raymond James & Associates   And then going back to the transaction volume guidance for -- this is again for e-commerce now for the quarter we are currently in, the fourth quarter of \'07, can you talk at all about, we\'ve got I\'m assuming BB&T and Citizens is what\'s been delayed, but without Bank of America, there\'s still Washington Mutual, Wachovia, and Wells Fargo, can you talk at all about transaction in general terms, transaction volume growth from kind of the non-B of A customer base and how we should think about that going forward?  Dave Mangum   Yes, I would be happy to. So I would start by saying this expectation for Q4 is quite consistent with what we\'ve called sort of our regression models of how transactions will flow given all the calendar-based conversations we\'ve had with investors over the last nine months or so. So as you look at…  Wayne Johnson - Raymond James & Associates   So last quarter was weak in this, as everyone recalls in this particular metric, and you\'re guiding down to that seasonality?  Dave Mangum   That\'s correct. Now, the key to this for us, as we think about the business itself, is you\'re still seeing mid-20% overall growth from the bank channel.  Now to go to the second part of your question then, Wayne, that growth is driven by 25% to 30% growth in transactions this year from all of our CSP, or our bank customers, excluding our largest customer. Our largest customer then grows a little bit less than that, so the net for the entire bank channel is on the order of 24%, 23%, as you do your model at 1% to 3% sequential growth for Q4.  So the way I would point you, again to go back to your question about all the other banks, is very nice overall transaction growth from all the other banks, all the other brokerage firms and the portals who make up the rest of that CSP channel.  Wayne Johnson - Raymond James & Associates   And is Bank of America still tracking towards 300,000 EBPP subscribers per quarter?  Dave Mangum   Well, if you look back, I can only speak to what they publicly report, fortunately for our purposes they do publicly report this number; they added 180,000 consumers last quarter. So not the average of about 275,000 we\'ve seen for the last four years or so.  Wayne Johnson - Raymond James & Associates   Right, but how they record it and it how you guys record it are two different things. If they record an online banking subscriber, that doesn\'t mean that that\'s going to convert in that quarter to an EBPP subscriber. There\'s usually a time lag?  Dave Mangum   Well, it\'s correct in saying their definitions are different from ours and there can be differences in timing, as well. The only thing I can speak to is what they report publicly themselves.  Wayne Johnson - Raymond James & Associates   I understand, okay, thank you for that. And last question is on Investment Services, the EPL, where do we stand on that rollout, and how should we think about the conversion from APL to EPL, and how does that impact expenses and revenues?  Dave Mangum   So I guess I misunderstood the question. You really mean directly as it rolls out from a tactical execution standpoint, and for that I guess I would say we continue to be on track to do some of what I call those pilot migrations later this calendar year, but you really don\'t see full migration begin until later in \'08 and that will take us all the way through \'09.  So I think what you\'re seeing in Investment Services, if you look at the current margins the business is delivering, it\'s very nice performance in a pretty complex year, in a pretty complex set of circumstances. A lot of that fueled by new services revenue we\'re driving, and fundamentally very nice account growth.  That complexity does not go away in \'08, and probably still exists in \'09 as we deal with migration, so we\'re still a ways away from the full return to mid-20s operating margin percentages that we\'ve talked about before.  Wayne Johnson - Raymond James & Associates   Right. Right. Right. Okay. Thank you.  Dave Mangum   Thanks, Wayne.  Operator   Our next question is coming from David Parker. Your line is live.  Dave Parker   Hi. Good afternoon. Are you still looking at other acquisitions, or have you had your fill for the time being?  Pete Kight   We\'re pretty bullish on the marketplace. If we found opportunities that we thought significantly strengthened our position, we would still be open.  Dave Parker   Okay. And then with the close of these two acquisitions, can you just talk about the recurring revenue nature of your business at this point?  Dave Mangum   Yes, I would be happy to, David. This is David. So I\'ll speak to the one acquisition we\'ve closed and continue to not comment on the pending acquisition.  With Carreker, it\'s a classic software sale, but the revenue recognition for Carreker historically has been all on what\'s termed percentage completion revenue recognition, which is where you actually take the entire value of a software deal, the license, the associated implementation services and the maintenance, and you take a look at that overall deal, and you recognize the revenue, particularly for license and services over the time it takes to implement the software.  So that could be, let\'s say six months, let\'s say a year. What that means is you have a software sale that creates effectively recurring fairly visible revenue. I wouldn\'t call it classic recurring revenue like our transaction processing business in Electronic Commerce, our account processing business in Investment Services, but it\'s fairly visible revenue when you take the percentage complete revenue out of a Carreker deal.  Dave Parker   Okay, thanks, guys.  Dave Mangum   Thank you.  Operator   We have a follow-up coming from Andrew Jeffrey. Your line is live.  Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey   Hi, Pete. I\'m wondering if you would characterize the individual components when you look at the e-commerce business, the individual components of add-on functionality as being maybe less well differentiated than your core EBPP solution, but then maybe if you do succeed in integrating those or selling them and then further integrating them into the total solution, then all of a sudden that creates incremental barriers?  The reason I ask is it strikes me some of the things you\'re describing, some of the functionality you\'re describing is similar to functionality owned by some of your competition in the marketplace, and nominally, then, it would appear that you\'re leading with a high value product, and then maybe following up with a lower value-add kind of sale.  Pete Kight   I think that\'s an excellent description, significantly better and simpler than my earlier attempt. The only thing I would add to it is I believe that with the transactional services integrated into the same platform you have the opportunity to further differentiate value you can then build out into these additional service capabilities.  We\'re very impressed with how much we\'re learning about consumer behavior, what they want to do, what their current behavior indicates as what they might want to do in the future. There is a lot of value that we\'re gleaning from watching the behavior of consumers. We think there is an opportunity to productize that by integrating that information flow into the services platform.  Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey   Okay. Is it safe to say, though, that while we\'re in a period of transition, if you will, or an interim period where the uptake on some of those newer services or features is somewhat lagged, that it takes a while to get from Point A to Point B, maybe even longer than we have thought previously?  Pete Kight   Yes. I think that\'s what we\'re announcing in this quarter.  Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey   Okay.  Pete Kight   I think that\'s fair, probably a more positive way than I put it. I think we could have certainly executed a lot better, but there\'s no question that in the current budget cycle in particular, but I also think because we\'re only integrating these into our transactional side, we had a more difficult time closing the deals than we thought we would, but without question, we believe integrating them into a bigger online services platform is going to be a lot easier and a lot more compelling.  Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey   Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.  Dave Mangum   Thanks, Andrew.  Operator   Our next question assumes from Dan Perlin. Your line is live.  Daniel Perlin - Wachovia Securities   Thanks. I just have a couple of quick questions. Let me just preface this by saying, Pete, this is probably going to be hard for you to answer, but if you think about kind of the reverse of saying are there more acquisitions that you would like to look at, I am wondering are there other companies you would like to be a part of, and maybe you don\'t have to necessarily pick them out, I wouldn\'t expect you to, but a simple yes or no, I think, would be pretty interesting.  And then the second part of that is, as the founding kind of father of this company, knowing where you are in a transition period in a very difficult environment for banks to get excited about spending money, what would be your thoughts on private equity transactions, given that there\'s so much money kind of slosh around in that space to take this company private? Thanks.  Pete Kight   I will give you credit for opening by saying this will be a difficult question for me to answer. That\'s fair. I\'ll try to do a little bit better than saying no comment, though, because the only thing I would just remind everyone of is we have always had a long horizon in our vision of creating value in this business.  We have been the primary driver of building the first stage of this marketplace. I would describe what we\'re working on now as nothing less than the next stage of this marketplace. And I am pretty positive on it, but I will clearly agree that there is a transition from here to there. We\'re going to do the best possible job, and I would say that transition is already underway.  We have been at work on this, the acquisition clearly calls out more directly some of the bigger steps we\'re making, but we have been at work on this. We\'ve known that making different components separable is important, and we have been doing that for more than 18 months now.  There\'s no question that we have a lot to build out in order to do this. You know, I meant it when I said; we recognize that originally we thought the banks would build out a fair amount of this additional value-add capability. That is not going to happen. We\'re going to build it out.  And as a part of the Corillian acquisition, there\'s components in that, in the Carreker acquisition, we have to get that done, and it\'s fair to say we have spent money and will continue to spend money and investing to do that. I think it\'s going to provide an improved return on top of our transaction business, but we\'ve got to prove we can execute on that, and we have to prove we can do it in a reasonable time frame.  I am a pretty big shareholder in the business, have been from the beginning, continue to remain so. I care lot about my family\'s investment in this business, so the horizon on which we build out this added value is important to me as a shareholder, not just as a CEO. I take the responsibility of being a public CEO very seriously from the day we went public.  I took it seriously in understanding we\'re not an owned company anymore, we\'re a public company now, and that is absolutely our priority, and so there\'s an underlying question to your point, which is what is the horizon in which you look to build out value, that is a fair question that we have to serve.  Daniel Perlin - Wachovia Securities   The other question I had, and thank you for that, I appreciate it, is do you feel like because you\'ve made these recent acquisitions, that you\'re end market customers are maybe taking it a little slower with you to see what the ultimate kind of package of goods that you\'re selling is going to be, and then, therefore, there will be maybe an acceleration potential?  Pete Kight   So I absolutely have received market feedback that the market is wanting to understand our full capabilities before they make further decisions. So there\'s no question, and there\'s no question we\'re trying to get information out as fast as we can to encourage that position in the market, because we think we have a compelling advance in the market place.  But of course we\'re limited in what it is that we can do until we close that deal. So there\'s no question that we\'re seeing that in the market place, and we\'re trying to drive it. In terms of the opportunity to grow faster on the other side of that, we wouldn\'t be making the acquisitions if we weren\'t betting on that.  Daniel Perlin - Wachovia Securities   Understood. And then the last question I have is one of the challenges you\'ve always had to deal with, I think, is really the control over the end market, and we\'re see something of that now.  I am wondering if you can just kind of maybe quantify how much more control over the end market do you think that these two companies that you\'re acquiring, and maybe even others potentially down the road, will allow you to have?  Pete Kight   Yes, so there is two components to control over the end market. It\'s obviously a pretty significant issue that we don\'t get to sell directly to the consumer. You know, quite frankly, I think, would have a -- made the decision to invest in the integrated platform and deliver on a higher value integrated online financial service platform earlier, if we had been directly in front of the consumer.  That\'s not what we positioned the company to do. The fact that the bank brand is just an absolute dominant preference for consumer safety, security, where they want to receive these services, that meant we were not going to be serving the consumer directly.  There is absolutely inherent in our belief that being in the online platform business means we\'ll have more access to consumer information for our ability to be able to serve the bank. We\'re not going to use that information to do something else.  We\'re going to use it directly into integrating back into the banks own services that will get built out on the platform, enhancing the bank\'s ability to be able to profit from their online customer base. So no question we\'re getting a full step closer to the end market in terms of the consumer information flow.  There\'s also a frustration in the banking industry that right now the banks are the people that come in and meet with us, value what it is that we can do. They are excited, they are interested, they went to know a lot about faster than we are able to give it to them, what this integrated capability can do, what their opportunities are.  But without question, what they are being charged with right now is to control costs. Even when we bring in discussions on ROI, on profit enhancing capabilities, right now their walking orders are politically I\'ve got X-cost targets, and I am not sure that I get as much value, and I\'ll have to go back and try to sell that up.  There\'s no question that right now cost is ahead of the focus on increasing profits. We need to change that. And so that\'s obviously another area of wanting to change that part of what I describe as the bank end market, and we\'re driving to change that.  Daniel Perlin - Wachovia Securities   Excellent. Thank you very much.  Dave Mangum   Operator. We have time for one more question.  Operator   Okay. Our final question comes from Tien-tsin Huang. Your line is live.  Tien-tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan   Thanks for taking my follow-up. I just had a quick question on walk-in bill payment and telephone bill payment. How did revenue and transaction trends look in the quarter?  Dave Mangum   Transaction trends were what we expected. We had reasonable performance in terms of growth from each of those two. We saw actually a little bit more revenue per transaction than we expected from the phone channel, which drives that increase in overall revenue per transaction, but essentially those two product lines were in line with expectations for the quarter.  Tien-tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan   The positive revenue growth for both those?  Dave Mangum   Yes.  Tien-tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan   Thank you.  Dave Mangum   Thanks, Tien-tsin.  Pete Kight   All right. I want to thank everybody for giving us this much time late in the day. We\'ll talk to you in a quarter. Thank you.

(NASDAQ: CMCSA ) JPMorgan Tech, Media and Telecom Conference May 22, 2017 11:20 AM ET Executives Mike Cavanagh - Chief Financial Officer, Senior Executive Vice President  Analysts Phil Cusick - J.P. Morgan Phil Cusick Here we go. My name is Phil Cusick. I cover the Telecom and Cable here at J.P. Morgan. With me today is Mike Cavanagh CFO of Comcast who joined the company in 2015. And before that, Mike spent nearly ten years as a member of the Operating Committee at J.P. Morgan including six years as its CFO. Mike, thanks for joining.  Mike Cavanagh I’m Glad to be here.  Phil Cusick And with the upfront done, last week, I guess we should start with that. How do you feel coming out of that? What do you think it was interesting? And what should we be thinking about? Mike Cavanagh Well, good. I mean, I think, it’s obviously the work that goes on leading instruments coming out. I mean, it’s too early to give any real read out or update for folks. But I think the team, across the industry is power of television to reach audiences and get big brand messages out, launch new products is unique relative to other forms of advertising. So we are quite optimistic about TV advertising broadly. Obviously, there is growth on the digital side. That’s been interesting. But we don’t think it’s over the long-term, we think TV holds its place and that’s the sentiment that we are getting in these conversations. We are particularly excited as we go in simply because of the progress that the team at NBCUniversal has made over the last five years, six years since the final business from GE when it was in the last place and now for four years running NBC has been the number one network and that’s on the strength of investing in big properties and we got the Olympics next year, Winter Olympics in 2018, Super Bowl in 2018 on top of the strength and the ratings that we have, our position.  That together with some of the leading cable nets and Telemundo which we will get to in a bid. The most important thing is we sell that all together. So I think, we – glad to the advertising community is that backdrop of optimism against advertising and are leading the conversations. So, feel good in answering the question. Phil Cusick Okay. And there has been a lot of headlines about the state of the national and local advertising markets. What are you seeing in sort of the business overall? And then specifically for NBC?  Mike Cavanagh So, I think, we – in overall, I guess, the message on national is that the decline in ratings that has been happening has been offset by increasing CPMs for the reasons I just described, advertisers staying with TV advertising and that economic model continuing to work. So for us, specifically, against that – which we see continuing.  And so, for us, specifically, being in the position like no one else is, as I just described leaves us feeling very good about national advertising for NBC itself. And then on the local side, local is an interesting – a slightly different story where what matters most is people tune in for news and more importantly for weather.  So, our team as the owned and operated stations at NBC have again done a great job. We love the markets we are in, had driven great results there and so we expect to have a solid remainder of the year. Obviously, ex-political, local is driven heavily by what’s going on, put up here or not. So when you normalize our political, we think it’s a solid year ahead on advertising locally. Phil Cusick Okay. You mentioned, Telemundo, that’s been a great five-year story, but it doesn’t get a lot of attention and I think it will get a lot more with the World Cup that’s coming next year? Mike Cavanagh Yes. Phil Cusick Just give us an overview of what’s happening there? What’s the sort of overall growth rate in the business? Mike Cavanagh Well, so the pipeline I guess, for investors is that our major competitor Univision, makes hundreds of millions of dollars more in profit than we do with Telemundo. That obviously correlates to how the businesses we are doing and so, years back, we were far behind them in terms of ratings and significance and now on the back of investments and programming, so heavy investments in prime time, later hours programming initially followed by a full prime time slates together with investments in sports, infrastructure and some talent has brought us basically into the same neighborhood to them in ratings terms.  So, obviously, it takes time to catch up in terms of affiliate fees in advertising, but expect that if we continue to sustain the progress, the position we have with, that we will be able to do much better profitability-wise in Telemundo over the coming years.  Phil Cusick That sounds familiar with CNBC story over the last five years.  Mike Cavanagh Doubled cash flow in five years. So it’s a good strong story.  Phil Cusick It’s the sort of under monetization at Telemundo similar to where NBC was five years ago? Mike Cavanagh Yes, so, I mean, and for the same reasons. The same way that NBC was lagging as the team arrives in the number four position. It takes a while to prove out the sustained performance and people had been leaders have a little bit of a grace period as they slipped, but eventually, you’ve capture that as affiliate deals for new and as upfronts come and go, you are able to monetize the difference and catch up and close those gaps.  Phil Cusick Okay. Mike Cavanagh And for the performances there, time and we have to sustain it and we have to then focus on getting paid profitably but that’s – we’ve seen that moving for confidence and being able to do that, really, really a good, good - very good success story that I just said. Just an another example, there is so many businesses in the NBCUniversal portfolio and as you go deep into them, there is lots of very similar stories in terms of just great and our management to these underlying – focused on underlying businesses and driving them forward.  Phil Cusick And is that, at Telemundo it’s still – both the retrans and ad rates business and do they sort of go together as they morph out? Mike Cavanagh Similar to NBC, retrans, affiliate fees and advertising. Phil Cusick Yes, and retrans at NBC, it’s been a huge tailwind this year. I think 70% up this year in the first quarter. How should we think about the growth there as you sort of captured a lot of that ramp or are we still going in that pace?  Mike Cavanagh Well, I think that was – I think de minimis or nothing, I think it was $4 million, five years – four, five years ago, it was $850 million last year. We’ve guided that we expect retrans to be $1.4 billion in 2017 and hence the growth rates that you described, it’s on the back of everything, I just described, the leading position of our NBC broadcast guide with all the things that we just talked about makes it must have televisions.  So, we will – you’ve heard some of the numbers that CBS talks about which is continued expectations for substantial growth and we see no reason why we wouldn’t be among the market leaders in retrans. So, there is more to come.  Phil Cusick Still following that same path. Mike Cavanagh Yes. Phil Cusick Okay. And flipping over to the Cable Net side, affiliate fee revenue was, I think up 9% in the first quarter, which surprised a lot of us given comments around the industry. How should we think about the sustainability of that growth?  Mike Cavanagh Well, I guess, I’ll start at the end, which is that we continue to believe that the – with all the pressures on the cable business from cord shaving and cutting to ratings and alike that we have been focused on these dynamics for quite some time. Steve was one of the other guys talking about the dynamics of the industry and what it meant kind of managing this kind of environment.  So, we said then and we continue to say that we think we can manage that business to be a low to mid-single-digits EBITDA grower for the time. This year, we had – as you said, 9% growth year-over-year in affiliate fees, which is a level that will drive EBITDA growth this year above that long-term rates and we’ll expect that to continue – this is a year where we have reached that a lot – even many of our affiliates yields we said at the beginning of the year had kind of step-ups that you get in the very first year which are bigger jumps typically, and then there will be back to more normal growth rates in affiliate revenues after this year for the remainder of those contracts getting us back to the longer-term guidance, which I think is good guidance in this environment for Cable Net profitability.  Phil Cusick Okay. And flipping to film, we had this a couple of years of… Mike Cavanagh We are getting NBC for you, for a change. Phil Cusick Other people covered cable. Mike Cavanagh Yes. Phil Cusick But film used to be a really volatile business and it’s I was talking to somebody about this recently, it seems like it’s becoming more stable. So, last year it was off a little bit from 2015 levels. This seems like with a number of hits this year, 2017 to be very similar to 2015 in terms of that record cash flow level. So number one, does that make sense? And number two, is there a reason we should see a lot less volatility going forward and start, maybe to monetize from an investor standpoint that that film’s cash flow? Mike Cavanagh Yes, I think that it’s been the team of Steve, Jeff, Donna Langley, Ron Myers from the beginning have talked about how to manage a slate of movies through time, that we were not in the business of taking big swings without a picture for how that fits into an overall portfolio. So you’ll see a lot more from us of building the kind of franchises we now have.  I think five years ago, we had one franchise, meaning a repeatable film and now we have eight across. So bringing back more proven intellectual property doing more and driving success in the animated side together with taking other comedy or other genres making sure that the size of the portfolio of – a best we are making in the slate in a given year kind of makes sense.  So I think that is the dynamic that’s changing the volatility and ability to monetize in the film business together with doing much better in consumer products as an example. So, going back to your question, we were record in the 100 year history of the studio was two years ago, $1.2 billion. We said at the time that was the – we had a lot of our franchises repeat that year.  So things – last year, we just simply had as good performance I would say for the type of slate and the number of repeat franchises we have. This year we are off to that and so, profits were $700 million, I think the third best year in the 100 year history of the studio and then this year we are off to the best first quarter and films like Get Out, which caught the cultural light case, but $5 million, very small budget. Split, we had the Fifty Shades and obviously Fast Eight came through with another $1 billion plus box-office for that franchise. So, got us off through a great start.  We still think Despicable Me 3 coming, Pitch Perfect 3, The Mummy, so, a lot still to go. So it’s certainly within the realm of possibility that we can repeat what we did last year, but we will see.  Phil Cusick So, with that many… Mike Cavanagh And then, again in 2018, we have Jurassic World coming back again and another Fifty Shades and that’s – if you think about the slate having the cycle that we roll through and hopefully we – when we are investing in new, we are looking to make sure that we have some view to create new franchises as we go.  Phil Cusick And how much does DreamWorks sit into that? Mike Cavanagh It’s – the animation side is successful movies in the animation side are among the most profitable or any movies you can mix. So what we observed and the team there knew when we talked about when we did the acquisition was that, we have a great animation team led by Chris Mellon and Andre in the Illumination, Minions, Despicable Me being among others, now Secret Life of Pets and things franchises launched last year.  So we’ve got that Studio Illumination, but to scale even bigger, we felt like we needed a – pull another animation studio. Chris will play a role along with Donna Langley across both of the studios, but getting more capacity to make animation products, rather than just pushing illuminations to do more than it was comfortable doing was the right answer. So unique opportunity to get that business a year – little over a year ago and we are very pleased as we sit here now.  Integration is going – gone quite well as kind of done and integrated. We’ve got a couple of years, so we really start to see movies that went from concepts to green life to production under our watch. But, the films that came out this year from the legacy DreamWorks were Boss Baby and what was the other one? Trolls, both did better, better than expected. So that’s great.  And on the TV side, the offtake that we do with Netflix was another big engine of opportunity for us where we at Universal had not yet invested to create animated television – an animated television studio. So, leveraging what we got with DreamWorks is underway on the TV side.  So, all good and then obviously consumer products feeds right into what we – we are already trying to do on the Universal side and as you know, I mean, we’ve got a substantial gap between the profits Disney earned on consumer products and what we earned. And we know what we don’t necessarily think that over time we will fill all of that gap. We have a lot of upside and given all the properties we now, all the IP we now have on the consumer product side, Phil.  Phil Cusick So how are you working on monetizing that? We haven’t talked about that before. Mike Cavanagh We hired some key leaders that have experience in the space. We are taking in – I mean, historically, like a lot of businesses, is it an area of focus or not and when it’s not an area of focus we had a lot of – just simply, folks that would be out there willing to license our intellectual property for pencil cases in Hong Kong or erasers in other places or lunch box.  So, either you are just trying to skim or you are really doing a thoughtful – what are the products out there that retailers out there can really drive, what can we do to really help use our creative to control more of that – more of those economics and drive those economics. Again, there is models like Disney out there that do it really well and I would say neither ourselves nor DreamWorks had gotten our business on the consumer product side to be executing or even aspiring to execute the way the best-in-class guys did.  And that’s now the mission for that business. So we think that’s again, hundreds of millions of dollars of steady ongoing profitability if executed right. So going again back to the – what’s the – how volatile should the film business be. It’s always going to be up and down based upon the particular movies in a given year slate and it’s always going to be up and down based upon does things hit or not hit how big your surprises versus your disappointments.  But things like consumer products, more animation are the types of things – things we are doing, we’ve got the Fandango ticketing business in the film business and so ramping some digital activities in that space and growing all areas where you can take the overall business and change its economic profile which we feel really good about.  Great work by that team. So again, that EBITDA from film was almost nothing five or six years ago, then maybe 400 five years ago, and $1.2 billion two years ago, 700 last year again, this will be another decent year and next year… Phil Cusick Hundreds of millions of opportunity in products. Mike Cavanagh Yes. Phil Cusick What’s the timeframe to get to something like that? Mike Cavanagh Several years, as these are not 12 months opportunities. Several years type of opportunities. Phil Cusick You are also spending a lot of money in the theme parks, it seems like a sort of continued CapEx effort? Mike Cavanagh Yes. Phil Cusick How long is that runway? You’ve talked about ten thousand rooms I think on properties.  Mike Cavanagh Yes. Phil Cusick Where are we now? Mike Cavanagh So we still have a good long way to go. You think about our portfolio on the park side, we’ve got Orlando, which is a big market where lots of visitors, thanks to the other theme park in the market. We have a market share opportunity of capturing our fair share of the visitors to theme parks in Orlando with a very unique peer of family with somewhat older kids.  The story keeps getting better and better in terms of the recent spend, some of your days in Orlando and increasingly all of your days in Orlando at our currently two gates at the Universal Park in CityWalk together with we are opening Thursday, the third gate which is going to be our Volcano Bay water-based theme park which something over the weekend, the videos of testing a opportunity out of this ten story.  He has gone Thursday, we’ll see whether he posts anything on Facebook or Instagram. But, we will see. There is a vertical drop he may or may not do. But you think about in a market like Orlando, where there is tremendous visits coming in. We’ve got 5600 I think hotel rooms, we would think and in a market like that, we have multiple gates, the idea of investing in hotels with our partner Lowe’s is extending length of stay.  So you can have people come spend more days, go from x number of days that plus together with everything we described including CityWalk and consumer products driving per capita spend higher, so we’ve got those levers that you are trying to drive and to do that and sustain growth, which has worked well for us, you got to invest in the parks.  So we’ve been steadily on about a one new attraction a year in each of our major parks. So we just opened the Jimmy Fallon in New York this year – in earlier this year a month ago. In Orlando, we had obviously the two Harry Potter openings in Orlando. Several years back we did Harry Potter in LA Hollywood last year and now of course we just bought in our Japan theme park and the same idea there.  And we’ve acquired the rides for park purposes to the intellectual property of Nintendo. So, think Mario and alike what our creatives are excited to do with that and we think that intellectual properties for theme parks tests well anything we’ve ever seen. So in coming years 2019, we should open a Nintendo World in Japan, followed by Orlando, sometime down the road.  And to the potential question for why anyway – why buy a theme park like Japan, well you think about the investment we are on, the ability to scale the intellectual property of something like, once you spend the money to create and conceptualize type of attractions you would put in a Nintendo World, well, if you are going to do that and have an ability to leverage that across multiple parks, we’d rather own then license out our name. So, Japan, great park. We are glad to buy that one in. And in coming years, maybe five years down the road, we will be opening in Beijing.  Phil Cusick And CapEx in that business has been ramping, call it 10% a year. Is there an opportunity to really accelerate that in an appetite to do that? Mike Cavanagh Well, I would say, generally speaking, we will keep doing what we’ve been doing, whether that’s going to require more capital intensity, I wouldn’t necessarily point you there, we will come back to that when we do next year’s guidance. This year, you are right, we are going to be up 10% but there is lot of things other than attractions that go into the numbers. So if you have to do some infrastructure on a periodic basis, sometimes you have some bumps. Phil Cusick Okay. Let’s switchover to the Cable business and talk first about, in the first quarter, you’re the only cable company to – or video company I think to add subscribers. Mike Cavanagh Yes. Phil Cusick And what’s driving that? Is it sort of a low-end mix? Is it a broadening of distribution? What’s happening there? Mike Cavanagh Well, you’ve heard us talk about it before, but it’s a combination of – we think we have the best video product. We think X 1 in particular, the platform that drives video for us, keeps getting better and better and as we penetrate it deeper and deeper into our base, that’s distinct versus other folks. And last piece I would say, we’ve been investing heavily in the customer experience and so that’s all is – for the last couple of years and we are all of those things are helping drive better retention, as well as more reasons to be with us and that’s the net effect of it.  So we are pretty, we understand and see that there is plenty of competition out there. There is new entrants in the OTT space coming in, but, we like the tools and our toolkit to continue to compete effectively for the business and continue to – and Dave said as recently as Thursday or Friday on another stage, his goal is to add video subs in 2017 for the full year and we obviously did in the first quarter.  Phil Cusick And part of that in video subs is – it seems like being pulled on along somewhat by broadband penetration that was starting to get a little higher, thought it was finding a little bit harder. Do you feel like the growth there is sustainable? Mike Cavanagh We do. I mean, broadband, we are talking earlier with a group, we think about broadband – I mean, it’s a fabulous business. We think kind of anyway the world evolves, our customers need and desire to have more capacity and faster speeds and the best product available to them in all dimensions is a very important great product to be providing to folks. So we see that as continuing to be a growth driver for us for quite some time.  As you know, it’s just the investment in speeds, 16, 17 speed increases in 16 years, the percentage of people that we have at 100 megabit speeds or higher, our investment in DOCSIS, new wireless gateways that are coming out, the XP-6 to enable that. Investments in Mesh Wi-Fi with our investment in Plume, you go on and on.  We are not resting on our Laurels. We are making the products better and better and that’s when you look at hindsight and ask the question about how are we doing – why are we doing, what we are doing in video, it’s – today, it’s because of the stuff we did to invest in the products in quarters and years past and think about just looking at our broadband business in the same way, continuing to make sure we are well ahead of the curve and innovating and making the product better and better over time.  Phil Cusick And it seems like every week we get a new news about another over-the-top potential player anyway, although some don’t really show up. How do you think about that ecosystem? Are they synergistic with existing video and broadband? Are they cannibalistic to existing broadband and as an owner both of media assets and as a distributor, how do you think about the dynamics there over the next few years? Mike Cavanagh These are little bit wait and see. We don’t have to wait and see whether they are going to be coming out us and trying to compete, that’s for sure, they are coming and we observe that and said so. The wait and see is, these things always take time to see how they mature.  You are seeing a lot of products that are coming to market, as we said for reasons, the reasons why we haven’t – we’ve been asked repeatedly why don’t we go out a footprint with a video-only product and we obviously see the benefit of bundling economics with other products we can deliver. Obviously, many of the OTT players, this is all they are doing and when they are coming out of the gate, with models – business models, that maybe a best or breakeven plus or minus a little bit and face the same long-term challenges that you all point out that we face which is higher programming cost over time.  So therefore, the losses are going to get bigger or the prices going to have to go up and will that resonate with the folks that are trying out the products in the first instance. We will see. All it does is, to me and to us is that, we like our own game in terms of segmenting customers, providing a great video experience through X 1, integrating Netflix, integrating YouTube, making it better and better as time passes, bundling it with broadband and providing a great value.  That one someone really does the – what do I give versus what do I get if I go to an OTT’s choice. We hope to drive it to a place where the outcome is that it’s more complementary than us, more bringing people back to the ecosystem than taking people away from the ecosystem, it’s going to be a different outcome for every traditional video distributor, but we like the way we are set up and continue to stay focused on making our video products better and better.  Phil Cusick Okay, let me switch to cost for a few minutes in cable and the non-programming OpEx growth in the first quarter was 1.4% I think, which was much lower than the trajectory has been. Mike Cavanagh Yes. Phil Cusick Are you looking at substantial cost-cutting efforts in there? What are you doing to control that one? Mike Cavanagh It’s lower. I wouldn’t say it was – should have surprised anybody, because we have said that it’s our intention in the last few years when we had – this year and last higher than historical and higher than what we expect to see in the future programming cost that we intended to do our best to maintain or only let margins drop modestly.  And so, the math to get from here to there is, we got to do exactly what we’ve done on programming costs in 2016 and 2017. I am sorry, our non-programming costs, that is. And the – what’s behind that is not random and indiscriminate cost-cutting in order to achieve that, it’s really the thoughtful focus that we need to run lean, leaner.  And also that we invested heavily going back a couple of years in the customer experience and as we said at the time, really the desire was deriving and coming off of redirecting sort of the troops that were intended to be working on the Time Warner Cable integration, Neil Smith and Dave Watson kind of said we are going to redirect all that energy and power into fixing or improving our customer experience.  And so we put a lot of effort which included a lot of expense against getting in front of the experience while we did the root cause work to change the back-end and now we are starting to see the back-end fixes driving calls and truck rolls and the things that drive customer service-related expense are coming down and we are benefiting from that roll down on that as an example.  Phil Cusick So it’s not cost-cutting, it’s the result of the investment… Mike Cavanagh We invested in – we invested to achieve better experience and we said all along and I have seen it in my prior – better customer experience is often done at lower cost. Phil Cusick Right.  Mike Cavanagh And so, the other side of it, lot of effort put into digitizing the business, so to speak making digital channels where there is fewer errors, easier for people to manage the experience, app-driven customer calls, onboarding through – and that’s a journey, because not all of our customers want to necessarily deal with it.  We got a legacy base but obviously in the world we are living, you see many companies doing a great job, running their infrastructure that way when their customer-facing businesses and I think that’s another long-term them that will be helpful to non-programming costs.  Phil Cusick So after a couple of years of investing in that and sort of larger than normal programming numbers, if that trajectory continues on, then in 2018, we can start to see real margin growth again? Mike Cavanagh We’ll see. Phil Cusick Back to some historical levels. Mike Cavanagh We will back to – we don’t go beyond the year in terms of giving any guidance. So, we’ll talk about next year when we get to the end of this year, but I would tell you that we are going to keep doing the same thing. Like I said the outcome of what we – what you are seeing in non-programming is the result of the same work that’s going to continue. Obviously, the – what’s specifically the opportunity that is that drives the numbers will be different as time passes by, but we are going to keep doing the same type of work. Phil Cusick Got it. Last question, last week, you sort of quietly launched your wireless offer to your sort of entire customer base with a – I think a $45 short-term offer for everyone. It sounds like the beta went pretty well and no real issues there. What have you learned so far both in the beta and the first few days of the offer? Mike Cavanagh I am not to be glued, but I would say we’ve learned nothing to – it’s too early. It’s – many of you have heard the launch of that product a couple of months back, we did an employee rollout that obviously left with all green lights. So we advanced to – as you say, a soft rollout to customers last week. So it’s a few days, but we are in no different place than we were when we kind of made the announcement of what we are doing, how we were thinking about it and alike.  So, we continue to be optimistic that going down the road, we are going down, we will have the potential to lower churn in our existing business, deepen relationships with existing customers. All at economics that can be standalone profitable and if all that works, that should continue to be a reason why customers come to us versus going to other places.  So, hopefully, it affects the arc of growth in the business. But time will tell. We said, people updated as we learn more and I would think about our offer $45 unlimited for our best customers $65 for everyone else on unlimited and then a pay by the gigs product, $12 for folks that select between those two.  Big point and no line charges and the big point is, within a household, not everybody have to do the same thing, so you can have parents on by the gig, if they are not using lot, data hungry teenager on an unlimited package.  So I think we will see how customers respond, but we think we are bringing forth between the value proposition and the fact that it’s obviously the best LTE network in the country together with the best devices, married together with our distribution. We have 29 million relationships today and we will do everything we can to leverage our existing business and assets. But we are going to walk before we run and learn as we go.  Phil Cusick As Brian pointed out on the call, the company has been around the wireless space for twenty five years, why is now the right time to launch an MVNO? You had the opportunity before. Is the overall ecosystem coming to the point where you really see synergies between the two sides of the business? Mike Cavanagh No, no, we are not at the stage where we have any – we want to learn what’s – we want to get out there and we now have handsets. We now have devices that are prior MVNOs or not once available under as good network as this one is.  The economics of this particular MVNO, remember, we don’t go into details, but it was born of a business transaction where we’ve sold spectrum that is valuable spectrum as you know, in exchange for something that we wanted to have good economic characteristics for us as we thought about one day potentially doing this. So I think the circumstances are a little different than they were before and now it’s certainly a good time to get on with hopefully driving a successful product – new product.  Phil Cusick Good. That’s all. Great, thanks. Mike Cavanagh Thanks, Phil. Thanks, everybody. Question-and-Answer Session  End of Q&A Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

With me on the call today are; Andre Dahan, our President and CEO; Avi Aronovitz, our Interim Chief Financial Officer; and others to provide support for this call.  Earlier this afternoon, we issued a press release disclosing certain preliminary unaudited selected financial information for the second quarter of fiscal 2007.

Hello everyone, and thank you for attending our call this afternoon. I'll begin this call with the highlights from our consolidated results for the second quarter, then we'll review the operations of each of our major businesses, followed by a few words on the strategic review of Comverse Technology announced earlier this year, and the status of our restatement process. Then Avi will provide more details on our second quarter results, and afterward we'll open the line for questions.  This quarter, each of our four major operating subsidiaries achieved sequential growth in revenue and pro forma operating margin. We're very pleased that we're progressing toward our goal of significantly improved profitability and revenue growth. Our consolidated pro forma operating margin increased sequentially by 520 basis points from 1.9% in the first quarter to a pro forma operating margin of 7.1% in the second quarter.  This first step shows that we are on the right track. In addition, business momentum improved as both revenue and product bookings increased sequentially, and we ended up the second quarter with a record backlog of $848.6 million. In the second quarter, pro forma revenue increased 12% sequentially to $454 million, and grew 15% year-over-year. This 15% or $59.9 million of growth was attributed to Comverse, Inc. growth of 5%, or $13.2 million, and Verint's growth of 49% or $44.8 million.  Verint's revenue included $44.5 million of contribution from Witness Systems, which Verint acquired on May 25th, 2007. As Verint discussed in June, certain Witness Systems' deferred maintenance and service revenue is not recognizable through GAAP purchase accounting, but it is being presented as part of pro forma revenue to provide what we believe is a more accurate reflection of Witness' revenue run rate and comparative data.  In the second quarter, this Witness deferred revenue amounted to $7.5 million. Other contributors to revenue growth this quarter were Starhome growth of 24%, or $2.5 million, and Ulticom growth of 1%, or $0.2 million year-over-year.  Now let's discuss our major operations in greater detail. First, Comverse, Inc. In Q2 Comverse achieved both year-over-year and sequential revenue growth and a significant sequential increase in product bookings. Additionally, Comverse realized substantial expansion in pro forma operating margin with sequential improvement of 370 basis points from 3% in the first quarter of 2007 to 6.7% in the second quarter.  Our short-term goal: double-digit operating margin within a couple of quarters and review the improvement this quarter as an important milestone in achieving this goal. This margin expansion was probably due to the early actions associated with our framework for profitable growth as well as favorable product mix in the quarter. Coupled with the broad market revenue growth on a sustained basis, longer term, we are targeting best-in-class operating margins.  We continue to build the framework for profitable growth at Comverse as the contact for the strategy and operational plans for the company. We are now focused on financial discipline and the development of revenue drivers to address the most urgent needs of our customers. These actions will allow us to achieve industry leading financial and operating results.  Comverse has an amazing customer list. Just this past June, representatives from over 200 customers attended our annual user forum where we present our current products, review future innovations and work to strengthen the depth and value of our partnerships. This past quarter, we added several new customers, including a number of takeaways from our competitors.  Just to highlight the few accomplishments in the quarter: We announced wins in Comverse billings and customer care in the telecom, travel and benefit card processing industries. We achieved wins and competitive takeaways in SMS text messaging, WAP gateways, InSight platform and other value added services.  It is clear; we are taking advantage of weakened competition in messaging and WAP gateways, and believe we are now clearly in the leadership position in SMS new product bookings.  Also this quarter, we secured orders in wireless personalization services, including wins with Tier 1 operators for both our Crony [ph] branded [indiscernible] and Fun Dial applications. And we announced the next generation conversed IP communication product suite and a customer win supporting Quad play services, one of several IP communication wins in the quarter.  Also after quarter close, we received initial orders from Tier 1 operators for visual voice mail, one of our new revenue initiatives. Demand for this voice mail capability is growing significantly, driven by breakthrough improvement in the overall user experience and we are clearly on our way to lead this category.  Recently, we received orders for a new wireless application such as network-based address book and photo sharing. And on the internal front, during the quarter, we realigned the expense base at Comverse to improve profitability. With the 6% workforce reduction we announced in June behind us, we are now focused on turning our attention to improvement on our horizontal processes including R&D, accelerated time to market and delivery performance. The early results of some of these actions are evident through our substantial operating margin expansion in the quarter.  Looking forward, we are continuously assessing the opportunity in the telecom industry, and have identified a very healthy pipeline of mega deals in all areas of our portfolio, whether in Billings, Messaging, WAP Gateway and IP communications, and we expect to be a partner of choice in many of these opportunities.  In addition, we are developing new revenue drivers, and our product roadmap leverages our leadership in voicemail, SMS and billings. This roadmap serves as a foundation for new revenues like visual voicemail, converged messaging, converged billings, wireless personalization services, and IP communication. This portfolio of products and services delivers high differentiation to our customers, and it provides Comverse with a strong basis for profitable growth. The new Comverse framework has started to yield initial results, and I'm confident that our actions will deliver a profitable growth in the quarters ahead.  Now let me turn to Verint. During the quarter, Verint completed its strategic acquisition of Witness Systems and increased its pro forma operating margin by 70 basis points sequentially from 10% in the first quarter of 2007 to 10.7% in the second quarter. The growth in its structured data in the form of voice, video and text is a substantial opportunity for Verint's advanced software-based analytics. These products deliver valuable timely actionable intelligence, enhancing security and improving business performance. And the recent combination was Witness System extend our portfolio and creates a new leader in workforce and enterprise optimization, and positions us as a strategic supplier of fashionable business intelligence.  During the quarter, Verint announced new customer wins in both workforce performance, as well as video security. The company is focused on the successful integration of Witness, and it is turning its attention to cross-selling and off-selling the Verint-Witness portfolio to both our customers and prospects. We expect Verint to approach 20% pro forma operating margin by the first quarter of fiscal 2008.  Now, to Ulticom. Ulticom, which provides signaling technology to the telecom industry deliver solution that are an integral part of messaging, billings, Voice over IP, location based, and wireless mobility services. In the second quarter, Ulticom's revenue at key OEM customers rebounded, and the next-generation IP, nSignia product line began to contribute to our performance. Ulticom's 52% sequential increase in revenue led the company to a 13.8% pro forma operating margin in the second quarter.  Finally, let's take a look at Starhome. Starhome helps carriers maximize their revenue from wireless roaming services by enhancing the customers' experience. This past quarter, Starhome achieved record revenue of $12.7 million, and an improvement in pro forma operating margin to 2.7%.  We made an important promise to you in our last conference call, namely that we would take the steps necessary to return the company to double-digit profitability. We believe that the second quarter results represent an important milestone towards the achievement of this goal.  In summary, I remain confident, and optimistic about the prospects of profitable growth at Comverse Technology.  Now I'd like to spend a few moments on the status of our strategic review process and our financial restatement activity. Regarding the strategic review process, we continue to refine our thinking with respect to the Comverse technology portfolio and its corporate and capital structure. As appropriate, we will provide more specific updates relative to the action we are taking. Our goal remains maximizing shareholder value.  We continue to make substantial progress towards the restatement of tax financial statements, after which our independent public accounting firm can complete the audit process. And as we stated last quarter, we expect to become current in our filings with the SEC by the end of fiscal 2007.  At this time, I will turn it to Avi who will present in more detail our second quarter financial results. Avi?  Avi T. Aronovitz - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President - Finance and Treasurer   Thank you, Andre. Our second quarter consolidated pro forma revenue of $454 million would comprise primarily of 63.5% contribution from our Comverse, Inc. subsidiary which posted 5% year-over-year growth and a 1% sequential growth; 30.2% contribution from Variant which posted 49% year-over-year growth and 35% sequential growth reflecting the $44.5 million contribution from the recently acquired Witness Systems in the quarter, 3.8% contribution from our Ulticom subsidiary which posted 1% year-over-year growth and 52% sequential growth, and 2.8% contribution from our Starhome subsidiary which posted 24% year-over-year growth and 31% sequential growth.  Our second quarter GAAP revenue, which excludes $7.5 million in Witness Systems' deferred revenue not recognizable to purchase accounting, was $446.5 million.  On a consolidated basis, our record 12-month backlog of $848.6 million at July 31st grew by 12.2% year-over-year and by 11.8% sequentially. The majority of this backlog increase was attributable to Veriant's acquisition of Witness on May 25th 2007.  Our second quarter of GAAP loss from operations was $73.6 million, compared to a GAAP loss from operations of $24.7 million for the second quarter of 2006, and a GAAP loss from operations of $61.3 million in the first quarter of 2007. GAAP operating margin was negative 16.5% compared with negative 6.3% for the prior-year period and negative 15.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2007.  Our pro forma income from operations was $32.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to $40.7 million for the prior year period and $7.7 million for the first quarter of 2007. Pro forma operating margin was 7.1% for the second quarter of 2007 compared with 10.3% for the prior year period, an increase of 520 basis points sequentially from 1.9% in the first quarter of 2007.  Loss from operations on a GAAP basis primarily reflects the following special items: special committee investigation and related expenses, which declined significantly as we had projected to $17 million from the $32.8 million of expenses incurred during the first quarter; $15 million expense for cash in lieu of equity compensation retention payment previously authorized and disclosed in the aggregate amount of approximately $62 million; $35.9 million has been charged through July 31st, 2007 with the balance expected to be recorded in the current fiscal year ending January 31st, 2008.  Workforce reduction and restructuring charges of $14.8 million including $13.2 million related to the previously announced workforce reduction at Comverse Inc. ; acquisition related charges of $10.4 million related to the acquisition by Verint of Witness Systems including in-process R&D charges; $18.8 million in stock-based compensation; $15.3 million for the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; and the previously discussed $7.5 million exclusion of Witness' deferred revenue not recognizable under GAAP purchase accounting.  Turning to our consolidated balance sheet, the company ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalent, bank time deposits and short-term investments of $1.43 billion, compared to $1.83 billion at April 30th, 2007 for a decrease of $395.7 million. This decrease is primarily due to the following two factors. During the second quarter, the company purchased $293 million in convertible preferred stock from Verint, which used the proceeds to fund in part its acquisition of Witness Systems. Also during the quarter, Verint used $40 million paid down debt assumed in conjunction with the Witness acquisition.  Verint ended the second quarter with debt of $610 million in addition to Comverse Technology's outstanding convertible debt of $419.6 million. In closing, we are making good progress on the restatement of our past financial statements and expect to become current in our filings by the end of the fiscal year.  We will now open the line for questions. Operator?  Question And Answer  Operator   [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Tom Roderick.  Tom Roderick - Thomas Weisel Partners   Hi, guys, good afternoon. I was hoping that you could go into a little more detail on the backlog. You indicated that the majority of it came from Witness itself. When you talk about the Witness backlog contribution, is that entirely maintenance support agreements, is there any services or license component of that? And then can you just confirm that organically backlogs, even absence of Witness would have been up quarter-over-quarter? Thanks.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Tom, we are not going to talk, obviously we have time for this.  Tom Roderick - Thomas Weisel Partners   Okay. Can you provide any commentary though regarding the statements that the majority of it was from Witness that absence Witness; that would have been up?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Tom you can... as you know Witness pre-acquisition was doing above $59 million, $60 million per quarter. So, you can't assume that the majority of the backlog from strong Witness, but as I mentioned in my comments, CNS has a significant growth in bookings this past quarter as well, you know we won't drill into a lot more details than that.  Tom Roderick - Thomas Weisel Partners   Okay, fair enough. And just shifting gear to looking at the commentary you've had on Visual Voicemail. Certainly more talks than we have heard about that in quite a while. Can you comment on what you are seeing from an industry transition standpoint, the iPhone release obviously had visual voicemail, well, not being from Comverse, is that something where you are seeing a lot of inbound traffic from Tier 1s across the globe, just any incremental commentary you can add there would be helpful.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Clearly, as I indicated in my comment, we view visual voicemail as one of the revenue. It's clearly iPhone caused the... an awareness increase in the marketplace, but we are... first of all, as I mentioned in my comments, we got orders from Tier 1 operators, but we have interest from both iPhone and non-iPhone customers among the operators who are seeing this as a new and opportunity to deliver end user services that have significant value, and you know we've had capability in the voicemail extension quite some time already.  Tom Roderick - Thomas Weisel Partners   Right. Thank you, Andre.  Operator   Your next question comes from Daniel Ives.  Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.    When you look at backlog I know you can get too much granularity, but was backlog organically strong... much stronger than you guys were expecting it to be?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Daniel, as we mentioned, the majority of the backlog improvements is the result of the Witness acquisition and the addition of the Witness business to ours but... and also the stronger product bookings sequentially at CNS. That's about all the colors I can give you at this point.  Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.    Okay but just I mean, I know you backed out Witness unless there was nothing anomalous, I mean backlog still would have been up organically pretty nicely and even year-over-year so. On operating margin, I mean there was a significant jump there; I mean just under 6% headcount. Could you just... are there going to more cuts coming? Is that just something you guys could discus, I mean that's a pretty big jump which is a positive. I just want to see if you could just explain that, how you can get such a huge jump in a quarter?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Sure. If you recall in my comments in the previous quarter what I stated that we are aiming at double-digit operating margin within the next few quarters. We... in terms of performance in Q2, I can tell you the contribution to the improvement comes from primarily two sources; a) some of the improvements come from the 6% savings but it's very early and it's not the entire improvement, but some of the effects of the savings is in the quarter and the second, very substantial one as well, is the product mix. The product mix in any one quarter is going to tell a story as far as contribution to margin. We are very pleased with the performance this quarter, so we've had a little revenue growth and a product mix that does favorability to product versus services, and the impact of the savings are reflected in the... in what I consider a good first half expansion of the operating margin from 3% to 6.7%.  Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.    Okay and I understand you being modest, but I mean where it was coming, it was a pretty good pretty good turnaround both in margins and even backlog organically if you back it out, and anecdotally it seems that you are talking light more positive than you were in the previous call?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Daniel, let me just --  Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.    No I am just calling a spade a spade.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   No, I really appreciate. The previous call honestly I was onboard one day of the previous quarter, so I was a lot more cautious a), b) at this point I see some positive sign, c) we took some action, which we knew where the right type of actions to be taken, and as you heard in my comments now, I'm committing to operating margin, operating double-digit operating margin within the next couple of quarters not the next few quarters.  Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.    You I see, did you say operating margins next quarter, I know you are joking, okay.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Next couple, Daniel.  Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.    Come on... okay. Should you measure rationally the mega deals that's the first time that you guys have talked about something like that. It seems very positive. Just what's happening out there with those mega deals?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   If you recall in my comments, yes one is I pointed to some deterioration of spend in the telecom industry. So, this caused me to go back inside, and we took if you want step or processing where we stood in terms of our pipeline looking at the future... looking at the market opportunities that are available to us, and we did a broad-based assessment of what I call mega deals, which are deals in... I'd say $10 million and up, and we see that the opportunity is very significant, the deals in which we are likely to participate, and hopefully to win a big percentage of this deal. This was a way of measuring the health of the business overtime, and coming back, and really getting assessment of where at the top line though I see revenue growth potential for the CNS business. And in the lot of way I am affirmative on that, suggesting that if the industry grow, we will probably grow above industry because we have a strong leadership position in the industry.  Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.    Hey guys, good job. Thanks.  Operator   Your next question comes from Thomas Ernst.  Thomas Ernst - Deutsche Bank Securities   Hey gentlemen. Thank you. First question for you Andre, I think there is some chatter out there as to the inherent profitability capability of the business that the gross margins. First question on that, looking backwards, the company when it was more concentrated to voicemail was posting 60% gross margins. Has there been anything structurally that changed in terms of the mix of the business that you think has brought in lower profitability components, things like a much higher service attach rate or more hardware, anything like that or do you think the business is kind of stay to similar mix?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   I think, you are bringing to number of Tom, you're pointing to number of areas like product mix over time what is likely to change, product contribution to the quarterly make up is likely to change because of the various level of market majority in voicemail in certain areas versus billing lay. I have mentioned to you even last time that is one of our growth engine. So, yes there are definitely some changes that occur all the time, but I don't think that they are pointing us down. In fact you know, I think with the right discipline, with the right action around reengineering some of our process, some of our delivery capability, and the R&D environment, we'd be able to effectively manage to these changes of mix by realigning, rebalancing resources stored in a more productive areas of the business on an ongoing basis. Basically, my markers, the markers that play critical for me was a) to first of all, go after the low hanging fruit in the business; two, make sure the opportunity in the market that we are playing exist and exist for growth; and three, then looking at the alignment... realignment of our capabilities based on these market growth drivers. So, I know I didn't give you a complete precise answer to the mix. I mean the company also was known in the past to have delivered double-digit operating margin. However, we never sustained that. We are trying to build this expense base to a level where we can sustain it, use the baseline to start from and sustain it, and improve it from there.  Thomas Ernst - Deutsche Bank Securities   Okay fantastic. Maybe one point of clarification within that.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Sure.  Thomas Ernst - Deutsche Bank Securities   There is one voice out there that's been vocally spreading. I think misinformation maybe, they just don't understand financials, has been saying that the voicemail... messaging business was never more than a 30% gross margin. I guess, my guess would be they are confused between contributing margin... contribution margin and gross margin, am I wrong there or?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   No, you are not wrong, you are absolutely right. That's absolutely incorrect. I must tell you, it's totally incorrect. The voicemail business had a high gross margin in the past, and what you are referring to is probably something closer to the contributing margin.  Thomas Ernst - Deutsche Bank Securities   Okay.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   That's only measured internally by the way.  Thomas Ernst - Deutsche Bank Securities   Fantastic. One more question following up on the previous question, and then I'll let others.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Sure.  Thomas Ernst - Deutsche Bank Securities   You mentioned that you think you can outgrow the industry, and looking forward we are expecting growth. I think if you do the organic calculation on backlog. We are around kind of flattish. Is that happening right away or there is still some transition elements you think before you get that growth recovery?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   I do believe there are some transitions. I think clearly it's going to... the industry will tell us whether it's growing at a faster pace, or not. I do believe that we have found with this... within the industry areas where we shine, and areas where we have a definite strategic advantage even with new product and services. I don't want to minimize the... we do think that's even in our core products there are extensions that we can exploit, and we are doing everything to put some rigor behind it to be able to go and attack these opportunities, and literally go after the competitors in the space.  Thomas Ernst - Deutsche Bank Securities   Thank you again.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Thanks, Tom. Thank you.  Operator   Your next question comes from Daniel Meron.  Daniel Meron - RBC Capital Markets   Hi, Andre and Avi, congrats on the improvement in the operating margins so quickly. Andre, maybe you can provide us with some more color on the spending patterns within the Comverse Network Systems business. My checks indicates that the CNS count was subdued [ph], but when you take a look at traffic, the subscriber count, adoption of some application, it seems like you to be in the rise. Is there some under spending going on by some carriers that you are seeing, if it is something that has picked up in certain areas or is it something to do with the execution from Comverse. If you can just give us more granularity there and then when do you think, if it is understanding with some more softness in the industry, when do you think that this should turnaround, and what will be the triggers for that?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Your attempt to make a call Danny on the industry turnaround, I think my data kind of reflect some of the data coming out of the major bank about deceleration in certain area of CapEx, also the growth maybe slowing down in Western European market, North American market wireless, but on the other hand I see growth in the emerging market. Now our focus is really identifying our best growth engines and aligning those to the market opportunity that we believe are growing. We have tremendous amount and a great success with our prepaid billing offer and even with the Kenan postpaid offer and we believe that will grow in... with billing, which we are making a bet off, which means where are the money being spent, the money is being spent with some major infrastructure capability and the money is also being spent with new types of services. Services that are either providing the operators with new ARPU drivers and we see some... that's one of the reason we see quite a bit of demand for visual voicemail and this is really true among almost all operators.  We see some demand on personalization capability and new type of services. We do believe that our converged messaging is another strong area of growth, because what we've seen in various mature market in SMS, so clearly it's hard to point to one, but I would say services that are driven by user experience is one, and two, billing because it's a must-have infrastructure component and where with the reengineer where they are competing and we are short-listed on every one of the large opportunities around the globe.  Daniel Meron - RBC Capital Markets   Great, thanks Andre. And I think in the past, you mentioned that you think that the growth in the industry or at least for Comverse could be in the double-digits down the road, maybe not now in the application giving space in general, low to mid-teens. Now that you had few more months in the industry and begin around the Comverse product groups, so do you still think that is a sustainable long-term growth that you can achieve?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   I never said that by the way, but...  Daniel Meron - RBC Capital Markets   I'm sorry.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Good try, Danny, but I would say that there is nothing assuming the industry growth, there is nothing preventing us from growing faster than industry. Again I want to make sure. We have a leadership position in quite a few areas of this space, and I think we can leverage that to a few points above the industry growth. So that's kind of my motto on that. I did say, however, many times that even if the... we were to grow at the modest level we are standing on the double-digit operating margin commitment.  Daniel Meron - RBC Capital Markets   Okay. Thank you, Andre. I'll get back...  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Have a nice holiday. Thanks.  Operator   Your next question comes from Shaul Eyal.  Shaul Eyal - CIBC World Markets   Thank you. Hi. Good afternoon guys. Two quick questions on my end. With respect to the InSight product on the voicemail front, where do we stand on the upgrade cycle? Is it basically over now?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   No. I don't think... no, Shaul, Andre, how are you?  Shaul Eyal - CIBC World Markets   Good. Thank you.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   I would say that roughly 40% has gone through the update cycle. I think we give markers along the way on that, but I think it's a great platform and this is one of the extension platform for us on the roadmap, and it will allow us to create new capabilities around voicemail, such as visual voicemail as one of... the one I mentioned today.  Shaul Eyal - CIBC World Markets   Fair enough. Andre, how would you describe the morale within Comverse, whether in the U. S., whether in Israel, whether in Wakefield?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   I think you know honestly it's... I can answer... if I wanted to dock the question and look the other way, we do have some morale challenges. I've recognized those. We've... again I can't ignore the history of this company, in particular the last 18 months. So, my job is to spend, to expend the lot of efforts to restore the confidence that we are an employer of choice that we are leader in the industry, and that it is worthwhile working for us. At the same time, we will have changes, and the last workforce reduction caused a lot of morale questions around the subject on whether we are going to see more of that or not. But that's a question that I grapple with on an ongoing basis and the team, the leadership in Tel Aviv has the same thing. But I do believe that we see improvement, and I do believe that as we share with most of the people when we communicate the direction and the strategy that we are sharing with the people, they understand that we are here to stay, that don't have a plan to sell CNS, that we are about to recapture any leadership position we may have lost in the industry, and get the people excited to work for Comverse. I mean that's a... but on the other hand, I am cognizant of some of the buckets of morale challenges, but we are working on that. And I have to say, if I was to just measure morale by turnover number, we are in line with the industry. I am not anywhere and I am probably somewhere in the median of the industry. We are not looking like a worst case scenario. But there was a lot of press written and as you know in Israel there is a lot of visibility to the press and they believe so.  Shaul Eyal - CIBC World Markets   Got it. Thank you very much. Good luck. Good luck.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Thank you. Bye, bye. Happy New Year.  Shaul Eyal - CIBC World Markets   Thanks.  Operator   Your next question comes from Larry Harris.  Lawrence Harris - Oppenheimer & Co.    Yes. Thank you. Congratulations on the sequential improvement. A follow-up to Shaul's question regarding how many customers do you have right now for InSight, and if you could provide a breakdown on the geographic basis in terms of revenues for the quarter?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Well, InSight is definitely a growing platform. I don't have exact numbers of customers honestly, but the distribution is uniform, is in excess... last quarter I think we announced something when we passed a 100 on the InSight customer list. I think that we were to overlay that to our installed base, it probably overlays in a fairly uniform way with the Trilog platform, the traditional platform. So, I don't have that data here Larry, I would directly answer it. But again about 40% of the base is InSight right now.  Lawrence Harris - Oppenheimer & Co.    Understood. And the geographic mix?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   I don't... I think the geographic mix will follow the geographic mix of our Trilog, which we'd say suggest very strong in Europe and basically, where we have... frank, I don't have the data in front of me Larry on geographic mix and InSights.  Lawrence Harris - Oppenheimer & Co.    All right. Thank you.  Operator   Your next question comes from Scott Sutherland.  Scott P. Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities   Great, thank you. Good afternoon and good job on the margins.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Thanks, Scott.  Scott P. Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities   Wanted to do a follow-up on the last question on InSights what kind of success are you seeing for attached applications to InSights, I think you guys are seem like wanted to add the flash applications to fill your 50% of your customers couple of quarters ago?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Yes, I think that's what we mentioned, yes Scott, I am sorry I don't have more... a lot of specific on that and that's kind of where you could look at, I think it's... of the InSight installed base over 60% is two or more applications, and to consider visual voicemail that's another strong extension that we are likely to see pick up. And I think it's an interesting dynamic here where we are really working on certain situations where; a) because we have InSight in place, we are pulling in with visual voicemail and in certain cases where I am hopeful is that we will take away from competitors some of the account, put InSight in with your visual voicemail on that.  Scott P. Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities   Okay. The iPhone has been up over several months now and there has been talk about increased interest given by its enhanced services, how do you see the market environment on that front of the value-added services and CapEx environment for the back half of this year?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   I definitely; a) I do see clearly a growing interest in iPhone, and in the iPhone extended services, resident iPhone as a product being specific to visual voicemail, which in a lot of ways that I've started talking to equipment manufacturer on the handset side to start thinking about potential partnership. So, we are going to see hopefully a pool for a new type of service. We took stabilize [ph] voicemail in a much more user friendly fashion. What it does to industry CapEx, I can't project that honestly. It's a question is a going to be with, and also it's going to be with the operators and the carrier, the wireless carrier. I have to take in consideration that there is some growth for us even if the industry grows modestly.  Scott P. Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities   Don't...  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Linearly linked to the CapEx numbers.  Scott P. Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities   Okay. And just a last question, with the... during converts in the lower cash balances, can you give us a little bit color kind of where interest income would fit in... where it could be in future quarters here?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Could you repeat the second part of the question, I am sorry, Scott.  Scott P. Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities   Just with the... convert with Verint's in the lower cash balances. Can you guys give some color of where interest income lies this quarter and maybe in coming quarters?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   No. We really can't provide much on that, it's our... I don't want to get into any guidance on so granular on that.  Scott P. Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities   And I'm not sure, you did it, can you talk about with this quarter was?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   We decided not to release information below the operating income line. So I prefer not to go there.  Scott P. Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities   Okay. I understood. Thank you.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   You're welcome.  Operator   Your next question comes from Sterling Auty.  Sterling Auty - J. P. Morgan   Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. I just wonder if you could characterize with the changes that you are making both headcount and I would think that you are down, how far along do you think you are in terms of the changes, structural changes that you want to make for the company as a whole, are you 25% down, 50% down where are you in the process?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   I honestly don't want to, I mean as much as; a) we took the right type of early actions, but you know actually we are working on an internal plan on an ongoing basis to really get to develop some financial flexibility that's going to allow me without a shattering changes realign the resources, address the key reengineering fundamental issues that they may have built into the business and get to a point where I can start moving resources from one place to the other, in a way that keeps me agile and not through major plans as we've seen. Another one I minimize the fact that you know, I clearly won't need to be in a position where by developing some financial flexibility I can invest in the future of the company, I can invest it in an innovation engine. This company has planned its entire like innovating there's no reason why we could not continue to do so. So, the type of actions that we are likely to take are more into process that as I have mentioned the first time, and we are definitely leaning behind those optimizing R&D, starting to think about optimization of our delivery process being from the point of getting a purchase sold at the point of delivery to the customer and acceptance being a lot more rigorous about this process. So, there is a lot of thing shifting that are not visible to the external market, but I clearly think the notion that the senior management team in Tel Aviv, and myself with that the holding team are working on continuously. We've agreed to the kind of the template that's going to allow us to move more a lot swifter than we have in the past.  Sterling Auty - J. P. Morgan   Okay. And the comments that you made, that CNS have significant bookings improvement in the quarter. How much of that is due to macro factors, and how much of it would be attributed to perhaps improved execution on your part?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   That's very hard for me to see that. I don't think that they were. Honestly, let me put it this way, between the first quarter and the second quarter, I do not believe that they were macro factor of significance that would have impacted the bookings. So, we will take the credit for the execution, Scott, as much as I can say, but I think we can point fairly good solid growth in booking sequentially.  Sterling Auty - J. P. Morgan   Okay. And I have got a number of... already from investors that they are a little confused about the whole backlog things. Are you suggesting they found an answer to an earlier question that we should take the total backlog, and that back out what you say $59 million or $60 million from Witness do estimate or?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Sorry Scott, to interrupt you no, no, no, I was referring to on this $59 million to $60 million is an entire quarter... an entire quarter of revenue to give you some guide post into how Witness performed, but no the backlog was nowhere close to that.  Sterling Auty - J. P. Morgan   Okay. So, again...  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   The Witness backlog was not as high as that.  Sterling Auty - J. P. Morgan   Okay. So, Witness backlog was lower than $60 million, because everybody is still wondering whether the backlog was up, down, or flat sequentially next quarter?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Actually, you know, Sterling I would rather check these and that's Avi, I want to ask Avi for that. I don't... Avi, go ahead.  Avi T. Aronovitz - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President - Finance and Treasurer   We believe that it was higher than a $60 million, Sterling.  Sterling Auty - J. P. Morgan   Okay.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Okay  Sterling Auty - J. P. Morgan   All right. Fair enough. Thanks guys.  Operator   Your next question comes from Stan Enders [ph]. Mr. Enders your line is open. Hearing no response, we will go to our next question, which is from Yar Rener [ph].  Unidentified Analyst   Hello. This is Yar here. My question is actually been answered. Thank you.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Thanks Rener [ph].  Operator   Your next question comes from Larry Berlin.  Larry Berlin - First Analysis Corp   Actually my question was just answered. I'll so listen not to avoid, have a great New Year.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Sure, thanks.  Larry Berlin - First Analysis Corp   Okay. Bye-bye.  Operator   Your next question comes from Jeff Kvaal.  Jeff Kvaal - Lehman Brothers   Yes. Thanks very much. Andre, my question is about product mix of the solution variations here. Would you be able to tell us a little about what products are higher operating margin portfolio and what is lower? And then secondarily, are you... whether you consider to be a normalized place in terms of product mix or should we expect to be significant variation from quarter-to-quarter? Thanks very much.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Yes. Sure, Jeff. I think in general, the mix in any one given quarter has been different from the other. But I can't give you too much the specificity about the higher profitability by product; in fact, we are working on an ongoing basis to get the point where we have full understanding of that. But in general, I mean it's going to depend on the content of services versus product revenue, license revenue. So, we've had a good balance this quarter. But again, I don't want to mislead, I think the contribution came from two points. One is the product mix being one. And two, some of the early savings actions we took in the quarter.  Jeff Kvaal - Lehman Brothers   Okay. Well, as a follow on there then Andre would be, in thinking about the next leg in your margin improvement, should we be thinking about further improved mix or is the next cut off, primarily about your OpEx reduction campaign? Thanks.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   I think, I don't want to trying to provide too much as clearly again the mix variations are almost unpredictable quarter over time. So, where I... remember we are... what I am trying to do is get to the fixed cost base of the company, regardless of the mix based on various contribution of the product lines, are put in place sufficient, financial discipline and established a baseline for the fixed cost. So, we can count on modest revenue growth to achieve sustainable double-digit operating margin, which is absolutely a must, one. And once we reach that cruising altitude to build through the second set of improvements to our business, hopefully, also counting on an industry that's growing a little better than what we see right now or what we have seen over the last few months. So that's kind of the story. But what I am not doing either is counting on the favorable product mix every time we do make something happen.  Jeff Kvaal - Lehman Brothers   Okay. Should we be preparing ourselves for quarter-to-quarter volatility perhaps something like a couple of 100 basis points in the operating margin depending on mix?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   I really don't want to comment on that because I think we are... I was kind of clear if you consider that I provided some guidance on operating margin. I stated double-digit within the next couple of quarters, implying clearly that I'm taking it in consideration that we may have variability on the way there, but the question of how much variability or should we expect some, I don't think I can answer that question at this point.  Jeff Kvaal - Lehman Brothers   Okay. Thanks very much Andre.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Thank you.  Operator   You have a follow up question from Daniel Ives.  Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.    Yes, Andre I just wanted to clarify something, when you talk about CNS, we're here to stay. Could you say the amount were not for sale? Look, I just... it's important to just clarify this, right, on a call?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Dan, I think there were enough rumors about every component of the business that were written in various press around essentially in Tel Aviv in Israel, and it clearly... that has contributed to a morale challenge entirely, because there were people hear that. So no, CNS is not for sale. I don't have the plan right now to sell CNS. There are no hidden plans that I carry that only myself and a few people know about. However, again I repeat the statement of the strategic review process is ongoing and I'll provide as much update as possible when appropriate. I mean that's kind of the position.  Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.    So just to clarify, yes, there is no plan to sell now but the strategic review is ongoing, in that I mean that's an ongoing thing right, you've just talked about?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Daniel, I think it's ongoing I think you know exactly the financial position of the company relative to the restatement and I'll repeat CNS is not for sale.  Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.    Okay. So you are saying that CNS is not for sale, and that something regardless of the strategic review?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   I never said that the strategic review process would stick in consideration almost to everything, the capital structure of the company, the corporate structure, the various businesses of the company, but I have to say the... we are in a leadership position in CNS. It is a core asset for Comverse Technology and where we stand behind this asset very strong. So I'm not at this point prepared to discuss what else we may do with the various assets of the company, but we certainly will keep the market updated when the time is right with any of the asset.  Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.    Which will include CNS?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Well, Danny.  Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.    No. It's important to clarify, right?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   It is important we are not... we never mentioned ever that we were going to sell CNS.  Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.    But then you've never, okay. I just wanted to understand in the context of the strategic review ongoing, as you said all options are on the table. Yes, I am just trying to put the two together to gain some?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   We did say that we are assessing every aspect of the business, the corporate holding, the capital structure, the various companies in which we have investments, and in that context all of the assets are being considered. However, I will tell you we have not considered selling CNS.  Daniel Ives - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.    To date. Okay. Thanks.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Welcome.  Operator   Your next question comes from Eyal Ofer [ph].  Unidentified Analyst   Thanks. Congrats on the turnaround in the operating margins. I just have a quick question, can you just provide me with an update on the fully diluted share counts for the quarter? Thanks.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Just hold on, Avi.  Avi T. Aronovitz - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President - Finance and Treasurer   Sure, the fully diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 209.3 million shares outstanding.  Unidentified Analyst   Okay great. And all the other questions I had were already answered thanks.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Thank you.  Operator   Your next question comes from Tal Liani from Merrill Lynch.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Hey Tal.  Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch   Oh, here I go, I was on mute, I am sorry. Sorry, I turned late, so you may have answered this, but can you give a status what's the current status of your filing? And also you made comments on product mix which make me to assume, just assumption that voicemail did not grow much or even declined this quarter in terms of recognized revenues because overall CNS was only 1% up sequentially and 5% year-over-year. So you also made a comment I think that penetration of voicemail is about 40% currently and the question is what's stopping really voicemail from growing to 100% penetration. What is there in the upgrade cycle that prevents some carriers from going all the way and replace this set of old technology with your new InSight? Thanks.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   I just want to say what we say this InSight represent 40% of the total installed base of voicemail. That's what we said and that 40% we... 60% of it has 2 or more applications attached to it. As far as the product mix, it's impossible to come to the conclusion you are coming to, and we have variability in the product mix on an ongoing basis, I can tell you that when I... we do an assessment of mega deal, we see there are some major vast voicemail messaging opportunities. So I couldn't provide you a lot more colors than that as far as our product mix on an ongoing basis for a value of that mix over time routed to share of the market. As far as the filing, I'll ask Avi to give you some data on that.  Avi T. Aronovitz - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President - Finance and Treasurer   Sure. We've said that we expect to be a current filer by the end of fiscal year. We've made nice progress on our restatement and we still believe that we'll be fine by the end of the year.  Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch   Now, just going back on the revenue question on product mix. So if 40% of your installed base is InSight that means that 60% is Trilog. So the question is what prevents the 60%... there is certainly... even if it didn't slow down, the fact that CNS is only growing 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially implies that InSight had major deceleration when I look at the trailing four quarters, when I look at sort of year-over-year trends in '06, versus '05, this is '07. So regardless of the right number, there is certainly deceleration in sales of InSight versus what we've seen in the prior two years. So the question is if 60% is still Trilog of the installed base, why is it starting to decelerate so early? What prevents it from... what prevents customers from upgrading to Trilog?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Well I think there are a number of things. They are number [ph] of mail and life on equipment that has not been reached yet. There are a number of factors. I think what's more important Tal here is the overall market... worldwide market in voicemail probably doesn't grow as fast as it used to grow because of various market saturation. Now with that said, we are still seeing opportunity for end of life, opportunity for upgrade, and now what I consider some opportunities that are driven by new applications, new services, visual voicemail being one of the new countless potential, and judging by the early market interest and the first few orders that we've got, I have to say we definitely are going to lead the category in that space, but if you kind of want to come to a conclusion that just as the overall voicemail market is growing slower, I think its driven also by the macro marketing of voicemail around the globe at various places.  Tal Liani - Merrill Lynch   Great. Thank you.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Thank you.  Operator   : Your final question comes from Sterling Auty.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   I think we have two more on the line.  Sterling Auty - J. P. Morgan   Hi it's Sterling again. I got two follow-ups. First is related to those new services that you mentioned. Could you just generalize for us what the average new opportunity for those new services look like versus doing adherence and let's say the traditional voicemail space? That's number one, then I have a follow up.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   No I can't explain that.. I can't give you much data on that. First of all, on visual voicemail as you know, these are now could become very large deployment, because we are talking about large operators that are... heard about the capability, are looking at the deployment of iPhones and the usability of the service, and now are looking to potentially roll this out and deploy that on various devices, not necessarily iPhones. I can't give you, I mean, it varies and it will vary based on the number of adoption around these services. So, I can't give you more color than that.  Sterling Auty - J. P. Morgan   Okay.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   As then what was the second part of the question?  Sterling Auty - J. P. Morgan   Yes. The second question actually was related to the comment about the... you mentioned 209 million shares, is that just shares outstanding? That's not before you do with the share count is that right?  Avi T. Aronovitz - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President - Finance and Treasurer   That's diluted, yes.  Sterling Auty - J. P. Morgan   Now, would that be for GAAP purposes, given a GAAP loss, so that would, probably would be in more like 230?  Avi T. Aronovitz - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President - Finance and Treasurer   That's for pro forma purposes, where we had income. So, that's the diluted share account.  Sterling Auty - J. P. Morgan   All right. So it's 209?  Avi T. Aronovitz - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President - Finance and Treasurer   Yes.  Sterling Auty - J. P. Morgan   All right. Thank you.  Avi T. Aronovitz - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President - Finance and Treasurer   Thank you.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Think we have a last question or?  Operator   Yes, sir. Your final question comes from Daniel Meron.  Daniel Meron - RBC Capital Markets   Yes. Thanks Andre for taking the question. Couple of quick things, first of all, can you describe a little bit more in detail your activity in the IPTV market? It sounds like you guys had some good inroad so far and if you can just give us some color there and what exactly you are looking to provide in that segment? And then just a quick follow up to that.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Well, in general in the area of IP communication, we've been very active in Europe as you know. And we have recently won a European IPTV deal. In general, we are focused on not necessarily all of the mentioned, but we are focused on triple play primarily, but have been involved in a few quad plays most recently. And we are experiencing a bit of success in the delivery of these services. I mean that's all I can provide you. So, we can... Danny, I can send you some specific on any one opportunity that we have disclosed, if you want.  Daniel Meron - RBC Capital Markets   Sure. But --  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   We have a variety of partners in this space, by the way.  Daniel Meron - RBC Capital Markets   Right, yes. But from the standpoint of traction, I mean you have an eccentrics in your ability, increased your IMS portfolio, and all that. Where do you stand today versus say a 6 months ago, 12 months ago. Did you see better traction, better deal volume, better margins in that aspect, if you can just give a little bit more color?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   We do see more traction. We see a little more market demand. We saw a number of operators first of all, looking at more mobile conversations, and entering the IPTV space. We see a little more demand in that. Maybe in some cases as an offset to voice fixed line type of opportunities.  Daniel Meron - RBC Capital Markets   Okay. And then final one from me, on the... once you do have... once you are current with your filings with the SEC towards the end of the fiscal year. Would it be fair to assume that's right after that you would go after re-listing in the National Exchange and if so, what would be the timing for that?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Yes, absolutely. I mean you have people here in the room are laughing. As you can imagine, we are anxious for a number of reasons; a) becoming re-listed is kind of an implication that we are back in business as a normal company, as a technology company. We can address equity-based compensation for our employees I mean there are number of substantial positive factor. We can't come out and be more transparent as far as the market is concerned, as far as our business, so clearly yes.  Daniel Meron - RBC Capital Markets   And a timing for that following the... being current is a matter of weeks, months sequentially?  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   I would say this is probably more a matter of weeks than months to do that first off.  Daniel Meron - RBC Capital Markets   Okay.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   I am sure the lawyers are going to slap me this evening on that so.  Daniel Meron - RBC Capital Markets   That's their job, okay. Thank you, Andre and Avi, good luck going forward and Shanat Yovel.  Andre Dahan - President and Chief Executive Officer   Thank you, Shanat Yovel. Let me try to close this, I really hope that during this call we were able to provide you a little more visibility on progress we made this quarter towards achieving our near and mid-term objective of significant improvement and profitable growth, and business momentum at Comverse Technology. I strongly believe that the results this quarter are reinforcing all of our confidence here for sustained profitable growth. The achievement of 6.7% pro forma operating margin at Comverse, Inc. and the 7.1% on the consolidated basis is the first half, but it is a very important first half. We are now on track for double-digit operating margin at Comverse Inc. in the next couple of quarters and as a sustainable base for our future improvements.  We are committed to achieving industry leading results, committed to maximizing shareholder value through a thorough and reasoned review of our portfolio and structure.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Richard Galanti Thank you, Samantha and good afternoon to everyone. I’ll start by saying that these discussions will include forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today’s call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company’s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today’s press release, we reported our third quarter and year-to-date fiscal year 2017 operating results for the 12-week and 36-week periods ended May 7th. For the 12-week fiscal third quarter, our reported earnings of $1.59 a share or $0.35 a share above last year's third quarter reported earnings of $1.24.  As noted, in this afternoons release, the $1.59 reported EPS figure included an $82 million or $0.19 per share income tax benefit in connection with the $7 a share special cash dividend that the company declared on April 25th and which is payable tomorrow May 26th.  The realized tax benefit related to the special dividend payable to company's 401k plan participants as it is considered compensation to employees under U.S. tax law. There is about a little over 30 million Costco shares held by employees among our other investments in the 401k plan. In addition to this one time earnings benefit, here are few other items I would note, when comparing year-over-year results. Number one first, our co-branded credit card as well as the case in both the first and second fiscal quarters in this past year, the Citi Visa co-branded credit card program, positively impacted year-over-year margins by 16 basis points, and SG&A expenses by 20 basis points. And our overall bottom line in Q3, benefitted earnings by $0.14 a share. By comparison and I believe in Q1 and Q2 the numbers were up $0.01 or $0.02 less than that per share, but still significant as we are still in the first year of the program change. Number two, gas profitability, our profits from gas during the quarter as compared to last year's third quarter were higher by $37 million pre-tax or better year-over-year by $0.05 a share. Gross margin, last year's third quarter earnings included a $19 million pre-tax benefit from a non-recurring legal settlement and this represented an improvement of gross margin of 7 basis points year-over-year or $0.03 a share, which was in last year and not this year.  SG&A, this year's third quarter earnings included a $14 million or $0.02 a hit to SG&A this year related to two non-recurring legal items, so whereas last year had a benefit, this year had a detriment. IT expenses, as a percent of sales was actually flat year-over-year as percent of sales and in-line with sales growth during the quarter.  Number six, FX, the two FX items, as compared to year ago during the third quarter, foreign currencies where we operate were mixed relative to the U.S. dollar and our aggregate weakened versus the U.S. dollar most notably in Canada, the UK and Mexico and this resulted in our foreign earnings in Q3 where we convert back into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes being slightly lower by about $5 million or about $0.01 a share, then if the exchanges rates have been flat. Conversely we had a gain reflected in our interest income and other line related to forward FX contracts and U.S. dollar holdings by our international subsidiaries, we do that when they use to pay for U.S. dollar denominated merchandize payables. In Q3 that benefited P&L by $9 million or a little over a $0.01 a share year-over-year.  LIFO, there was no LIFO charge or credit in this year's third quarter results whereas last year in the quarter we had LIFO credit of $13 million reflecting deflation in our LIFO indices. That represented about a $0.02 a share benefit credit last year and versus nothing this year but we do have deflation. There is no LIFO reserve to draw from and essentially you can't go below zero. Income tax rate, as previously discussed, our third quarter tax rate was very favorable due to the treatment of the special dividend, as a result the reported tax rate in Q3 was 26.8%. Excluding the impact from the special dividend our normalized tax rate would have been 35.3% for the quarter. Turning to our third quarter sales, reported sales were up 8% and our 12 week total company reported comparable sales figure was up 5%. For the quarter, the plus five comp sales figure was helped by gasoline price inflation to the tune of about 140 basis points and offset or hurt from FX by about minus 60 basis points.  By segment the company increases were as follows; U.S. six, Canada two, international four excluding the impacts from gas and FX, the six in the U.S. would have been at five, the reported Canada of two would have been three and the international reported at four would have been a six, still totaling up to five overall. In terms of new openings, our opening activities and plans, we opened 12 net new locations during the first two fiscal quarters, the first half of the year; in Q3 we opened a net of two new units, three total and one [indiscernible], so including our 37th location in Mexico and our first business center in Canada in Ontario.  For all of fiscal 2017 we have current plans to open a total of 12 more locations, so 26 net locations for the year; of the 26 for the entire fiscal year 13 were in the U.S., six in Canada, on a base of 91, one each in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Mexico and Australia as well as our first openings both in Iceland, which occurred two days ago, on Wednesday and France coming towards the end of next month in June. This afternoon I'll also review membership trends and renewal rates, the upcoming membership fee increases plan for the U.S. and Canada, those become effective next week on June 1st.  An update on the CV’s Anywhere card program, additional discussion about our margins and expenses in the quarter. E-commerce results and the recent special dividend and related $3.8 billion debt offering that we completed recently. So starting with improve results. As I mentioned, sales were up at $28.22 billion, up 8% over last year’s $26.15 billion in the quarter. Again, on a reported basis and on ex-gas and FX basis, comps were up 5%. For the quarter, our 5% reported comp figure was a combination of an average transaction increased of 2% and an average shopping frequency increased a little over 3% and as little over 3% is something wide and was the 4% just in the U.S. In terms of sales comparison by geography, Texas and Midwest regions were strongest, with Northwest, Southeast and California not far behind. Internationally, in local currencies, better performing countries the UK, Korea and Mexico. In terms of merchandise category sales for the quarter, for the third quarter within food and sundries and was up in the low-single-digits spirits, deli and candy were the leaders.  Tobacco continues to be a negative, and as we have mentioned in the last two to three quarters anniversary itself by the end of June the tobacco component. For hard lines, overall in the mid-single-digits, strongest department sales were in tires, hardware, and health and beauty aids. Our consumer electronics overall were down low singles. Soft lines also were up in the mid-single-digit range, with apparel, house wares and domestic showing these best results. And in fresh foods comps were up in the low-single-digits. Within ancillary, gas had great comps in the quarter aided by of course the higher sell price per year to $2.42 per share versus $2.08 a year ago, as well as strong comp gallon growth. In addition, hearing aids were up in the mid-teens in terms of comps followed by optical in the high-singles and pharmacy in the low to mid-singles. In the third quarter, the U.S. front-end basket. U.S. units were just under percentage point. Well average basket value was slightly positive. These results now standing they were still seeing a little deflation in the core business. Lastly, in Q3, the number of MVM promotional days, if they were to stay year-over-year in Q3 plan change from Q2 and year-over-year during the 12 weeks in the second quarter, they were 17 fewer in the MVM promotional days and as we have mentioned in the last call need to make changes. So the lack of promotional days wouldn’t impact company as much as it had impact since the quarter. Moving to the line items in the income statement, membership fees reported came in at $644 million, up 4% in dollars or $26 million and down eight basis points as a percent of sales. FX had a low to do with the dollar increased and also the number of new openings year-over-year in the quarter. In terms of membership, we continue enjoy strong renewal rates 90.2% in U.S., Canada 87.5% worldwide on a fully capture basis and we continue to see increasing penetration of the executive membership and those companies where we offer that.  At the end of the quarter, we had $37.8 million Gold Start members, up from 37.5 million 12 weeks earlier at the end of the second quarter. This is primary $7.4 million, the same quarter-over-quarter for 12 weeks. Business add-on $3.4 million and $3.4 million. Household we had $48.6 million member households that for $48.3 million 12-weeks earlier. Notwithstanding the effect where we just had a few openings in the quarter. Total card holders, came in at the end of the quarter 88.9 million, up from 88.1 million at the end of the second quarter. Also at the end of the third quarter, paid Executive Memberships stood at 18.3 million, and increased during the 12-weeks of 345,000 new Executive Membership or about 29,000 a week increase in the quarter. Executive Members now represents about 38% of our member base, and about two-thirds of our sales closer to 70% of sales in those countries based on the countries where it operates.  In terms of renewal rates, business members renewed and these members would be in U.S. and Canada which is about over 80% of our business. Business came in at 94.1% at the end of the quarter, down from 94.3% at the end of the prior quarter consistent with what we have seen in the U.S. as we are still in the process in first year of year-over-year from moving the card over to the new Visa Citi card.  Gold Star, remains both at second quarter end and third quarter end at 89.5 and its total was 90.2 both in the quarter end, so again we rounding, causing some of that, but those are the numbers 90.2 both at second quarter end and at the third quarter end. Worldwide, which includes the outside of U.S. and Canada actually and at the end of the quarter it was 87.5, we rounded up to 87.7 at the end of the second quarter, which had been up from 87.5 at the end of the first quarter.  Regarding the increases in annual membership fees in the U.S. and Canada these go into effect again next week on June 1 st , recall that we had taken fee increases in several of other countries this past September for us is the beginning of our current fiscal year. Our primary membership will increase $5 to $60 and Executive Memberships will increase to $120 up $10. And with regard to Executive Membership the 2% reward caps associated with the Executive Membership is being increased from the current $750 per year level to a $1,000 per year level based on eligible purchases by these Executive Members.  In all, the fee increase impacts about 35 million member households will be impacted by it about half of whom are Executive Members and half of who are Primary Members, so $10 to $5. Note that the Membership fees are accounted for differed basis, so in terms of when it will benefits the membership fee income line of the P&L. The full P&L impact would be over 23 months timeline based on the fact that it's over the next 12 months that renewers will get their first increase and then it's differed over a year period from which from the time that they originally pay it.  Before continuing down the income statement a quick update and few updated stats on the Citi Visa card offering which began last June early in our fiscal fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Recall we would began last June with approximately 11.4 million co-branded cards which represented 7.4 million accounts that were transferred to city at the conversion.  As of Q3 end we now have about 1.5 million new approve member accounts, which represents about 2 million new cards since the last June 20th and that 1.5 million that represents about 290,000 additional accounts over the past 12 weeks since Q2.  And overall we are seeing the Citi Visa co-branded portfolio total spend higher year-over-year that both organically from cards converted to Citi last June and from these new accounts. In terms of the conversion the usage in this signs-offs the card I think as I said a quarter ago and a quarter before that so far so good. Turning down to the gross margin-line, gross margins reported were up eight basis points, I'll ask you to do a little metrics here, four columns, well there will be two columns for Q2 2017 and two for Q3 2017, column one will be reported to 2017 year-over-year, column two will be without gas inflation and then columns three and four again will be reported for Q3 2017 and then Q3 without gas inflation. Those would be the year-over-year basis points change.  The first line item is core merchandizing, in Q2 year-over-year was plus one basis points and ex-gas it was plus nine , and Q3 reported plus seven and ex-gas plus 20. Ancillary businesses, minus 20 and minus 18 in Q2 and the two columns of Q3 will be plus 15 and plus 19. 2% reward, zero and minus one, and then minus two and minus four, LIFO minus fives across the board, again having some deflation this year but comparing to credit deflation last year in the credit but nothing to credit since we are below zero there.  Other zero and zero in the two Q2 columns, and minus seven and minus seven in two Q3 columns, so all to all the year-over-year in Q2 we reported gross margins in Q2 down 24 basis points and ex-gas they were down 15, this year in the quarter there was plus eight reported and plus 23 ex-gas.  Now if you take the numbers that I talked to you about on the benefit from the change to Citi Visa as compared to what it would have been had we had the old program. We benefitted as I mentioned by 16 basis points year-over-year in Q3, and I believe in Q2 we also benefited year-over-year by 16. So again if you just simply look at the total of just two Q3 here, the reported plus eight would have been minus eight ex that single benefit of the Citi Visa and the plus 23 would have been plus seven ex that, and that's how it shook out. Overall Q3 reported gross margin again as I mentioned was started by eight or reported basis 0.3% excluding, as I usually do I'll go through the core merchandize component which is about 80% of our sales, food and sundries, hardlines, soft lines and fresh foods, the core merchandize component gross margin was actually higher by seven basis points year-over-year and up 20 basis points excluding gas price inflation.  Excluding the benefits of Citi Visa, minus nine and plus four, so again the plus four excluding gas inflation will be the number if you look at here. I'm sorry, it's essentially wrong. The plus side it was what I really told about the whole company.  In terms of the subcategories at the core, food and sundries, hardlines, soft lines and fresh foods, as a percent of their own sales they were actually positive year-over-year in the quarter by 12 basis points, with food and sundries, and hardlines both higher year-over-year, our soft lines and fresh foods little bit year-over-year but net of all four under our sales was up 12.  Second, ancillary and other businesses gross margins were up about 15 basis points, about 19 ex-gas deflation, about two of theirs that year-over-year increase was due to higher gas profits as I mentioned earlier in the call, but even ex that the other ancillary businesses, that year-over-year were up a little bit.  2% rewards, minus two basis points and minus four ex-gas, that basically means more usage by numbers you get the 2% Executive Member reward into spend or more. LIFO I talked about twice already. And lastly the other that minus seven if you will is the fact that last year, that was an $19 million non-recurring legal settlement, which of course zero this year so it’s a minus seven year-over-year comparisons. Overall, margins we felt were good, with solid results in the quarter to plus 12 basis points on core sales and gas margins again also positively contributing not only in terms of higher gross margin within the gas sales as well. Offset by negative year-over-year comparisons from LIFO in the one-time settlement from last year. Moving onto SG&A, our SG&A percentage in Q3 year-over-year was low or better by 14 basis points, and that plus 14 will be flat or zero without gas inflation, coming but plus 14 was basically 10.44 versus 10.30 last year. Again as I mentioned earlier, the benefit effectively lower fees related to taking new card versus our own program. Year-over-year would have been better by 20 basis points in those numbers are in here. So again, I will ask you to do a little metrics with the same four columns, Q2 2017 reported and Q2 2017 ex-gas and then Q3 2017 reported and Q3 2017 ex-gas.  In terms of core operations, reported into 2017, we were up 8 basis points, I’m sorry better or lower by 8 basis points year-over-year, without gas better or lower by 1 basis point. And then Q3 reported lower or better by 21 and ex-gas lower better by nine. Central minus two and minus three, so that was higher by that amount year-over-year and minus one and minus three.  Stock compensation pretty much in-line with the sales, but it’s always a big impact in the Q4, in Q1 what we do our big brand each year. Stock compensation was minus one and minus two or higher year-over-year in Q2, to two Q2 columns and minus one and minus one again a little higher in the Q3 columns. Other is zero to zero in Q2 in this two Q3 columns minus five and minus five and again that relates to the $14 million in the two legal items that we are non-recurring that impacted this year Q3. Also told, last year in Q2, SG&A reported was lower or better by plus five basis points and in natural gas inflation higher or slightly higher by four basis points. This year reported better by 14 ex-gas zero basically flat and again I’ll just use the two Q3 columns. If you take out the benefit from the Citi Visa conversion and that was 20 of the 14 if you will so ex that it would have been higher or over minus six and again the zero would have been higher or minus 20.  Now excluding the Citi Visa Central year-over-year was higher by basis point reported in three without gas. Nothing unusual to quarter, depreciation expense was slightly higher year-over-year again stock compensation expense was a basis point higher and that other was minus five. Next on the income statement line. Pre-opening expense $3 million lower this year coming in the 15 million versus 18 million. Quite a few less openings, eight last year in the quarter and three this year and but that has to do timing of locations to all the pre-opening doesn’t actually happen in the quarter, which the actual opening occurs.  And certainly this year’s figure also include some of the pre-opening expense rate turn entry into two new countries Iceland and France. All told operating income in Q3 came in at 968 million or better by 110 million, which is 13% higher year-over-year. Below the operating income line reported interest expense came in at 21 million.  Interest expense in Q3 this year is quite a bit of a lower improvement from last year's Q3 came in at 21 million as 9 million lower than last year reported $30 million for a year. Virtually all of it is due to the payments back in March of the our 1.1 billion, 5.5% fixed rate note that we as a [indiscernible] year note that we paid it off on March 15th, so that is about 60 million a year annualized interest savings since that end March 15th date. As we reported last week, we successfully completed a new debt issuances totaling 3.8 million and that was done in fourth tranches, there was an $800 million five year tranche and then three $1 billion tranches at five, seven and 10 years. The details of that can be found in the press release dated May 9th. [indiscernible] the new debt have the un-mounted rate of little over 2.6%. As well on May 15th we gave notice of early pay-off of our December 2017 $1.1 billion 108% notes and the expected pay-off date will June 15, 2017. Next line item on the income statement, interest income and other, it was higher year-over-year by $11 million coming in at 18 million in Q3 as compared to 7 million a year earlier. Now actual interest income for the quarter was better, but better year-over-year by 2 million. In addition we have benefitted by about 9 million I mentioned that earlier in credits mostly relating to the various FX items discussions and that I have discussed in the beginning of the call.  So adding these two line items, from operating income overall pre-tax income was higher by a 130 million or 16%, coming in at 965 million this year during 12 weeks as compared to 835 million a year-ago.  Again in terms of income taxes our reported tax rate this quarter of 26.8% normalized that would be 35.3 and that compares to last year 34.2, and we would expect it to be in that 35.3-ish range for the year. Overall, reported net income came in right at $700 million and that's compared to our reported $545 million a year-ago.  A quick rundown of the other usual topics. The balance sheet as included in this afternoons release, a couple of quick items that I always go through that one of them that’s not on their is depreciation and amortization for the quarter total $320 million and year-to-date $929 million.  One of the metrics we always look at is accounts payable as a percent of inventories as through the balance sheet came in at 97% it was 99% a year-ago in the quarter. We also take on all the non-merchandize payables and we calculate it so it's merchandize payables as a percent of inventories and that to came down two percentage points from 89 a year-ago to 87 so there is still a vast majority of inventories being trade balance. Average inventory per warehouse that was up $693,000, coming in at $13.4 million compared to $12.70 million a year ago, about almost that quite 40% of it was majors electronic, we are seeing a big shift and finally a big increase and particularly in TVs kind of the next generation of bigger more K and you name it as well as some other electronics areas.  Small increases in various other departments as well some buildup in inventories related specifically to our e-commerce as just in the last year we have gone from seven to 19 e-commerce fulfillment centers in the U.S. year-over-year, but many of those and mostly those are connected to our depot operations we not their building along the new warehouses just for that. In terms of CapEx, In Q1 , we spent $670 million. In the Q2 515 and Q3 538, so year-to-date we are at 1.723 billion. And overall for the year we'd probably be in the 2.5 to 2.7 range, probably it's maybe 100 less than we had estimated the quarter or so ago, just a couple as you saw in the number we are expecting 26 for the year, just a few delays nothing terribly different.  In terms of e-commerce we continue in the locations where we were 12 weeks ago, U.S., Canada, UK, Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, and we expect to do additional countries over the next one and a half or so years. For Q3 sales and profits were up, online sales were up 11% a quarter as well as comps at the same locations. Within the 12 weeks, we look at four week periods ourselves, that came net 11, represented 13 or 14 in the seventh, and the seven was weak in part due to the shift in both Easter, Mother's Day, but overall the number for the quarter was 11.  We continue to improve our offerings, and enhance our member experience, we continue to add new areas of merchandize, improved in-stocks on high velocity items as evidenced by conditional inventories in those areas and more locations. In April, we launched something new GE Appliances along with their self services delivery schedule, it's starting off well, but again it's just started off, and we will continue to add additional names. In terms of online Kirkland Signature items, we recently launched Kirkland Signature maternity apparel, they have all so expanded from our KS groceries and consumable items on dot-com, and if you are in the mood for A4 Wagyu Center Cut New York Strip Steaks, we apparently have a great deal on four or 12 ounce steaks for $499.99. In terms of improving the experience functionality we have improved search, streamlined the checkout process both mobile and desktop, improved the members ability to track orders and Nevada made in much of the merchandize returns process.  Now, many people have that, we are newer to it, but we have done a good job I think in the last six to nine months of getting that member experience and functionality a lot better on the site.  Overall good things are happening online and both in terms of member experience and expanded products and certainly the great value is to our members. We still want you to come into the warehouse of course. Next discussion expansion, as mentioned for the third quarter we opened three locations clearly one reload so net of two, quite of a lot openings in Q4, 12 total including Iceland just a couple of days ago. In fiscal 2016 if you recall we opened 29 units, so about 4.5% square footage growth, this year it was at 26 if it wasn't been delayed into the fall, 26 for the year that will be about 4% square footage growth, of the 26, half 13 are in the U.S., a quarter six are in Canada, and then one each in those countries that I mentioned earlier. And again of course this is our first locations opened to fans which is scheduled for I believe June 22nd and again Iceland just opened.  Total square footage some of you asked about Q3 ended sort of 105.4 million square feet. In terms of buybacks in Q1 we brought back $122 million worth, Q2, $66 million, Q3, $45 million, total of $233 million of stock or 1.486 million shares at an average of about $156.5. Regarding dividends in addition to special dividend, we increased our quarterly dividend, that was announced also on April 25 th . The new amount is $0.50 per share per quarter, so $2 a year, that's up 11% from the prior $0.45 a share and again that will be also be paid tomorrow on May 26th or 56 quarterly amount. The $2 a share annualized dividend represents a total annual cost of company of about just under $900 million. And as I mentioned earlier, the $7 share driven that will be paid on to shareholders tomorrow as well. Lastly, our fiscal 2017 fourth quarter scheduled earnings release date and this is for the 17-week this international week in the year. For the 17-week fourth quarter that Amazon that is September 3rd, we will do the earnings release after the market closes on Thursday October 5th, with the earnings calls that afternoon it to get to be a pacific time. With that, happy to open it up for a questions-and-answers. And I’ll turn it back over to Samantha. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel. John Heinbockel So Richard, first topic expansion and business centers. So you have added some more there is couple of coming here in the next month or so. How do you think about business centers versus regular clubs number one? And when you think about is there a big potential business center expansion here. And then lastly on expansion when you think about, is it too early to think about 2018 and we sort of get back to 30 openings worldwide next year? Richard Galanti Well, first of all with regard to the business centers, I think we started the year with 14 and signed up four this year so 18, that should be up by 1, and are first in Canada, we call that we had business centers for, I think we are going from four or five to seven or eight over about 10 plus years. And so we continue to be hit and news say we have found something that seems to work now and then there is a little method to that madness.  And but it’s corollary to what our primary businesses is opening full Costco membership warehouses. And we were continue to open more, but I think again this is guess at this point. But on assuming the base at end of the year is 18 that should be up one using that two to seven or two to six or three to five, I mean, that will be in that range for the next couple of years. We are not looking to go from 14 to 18 to 28 in a year.  And so far so good, I think a couple of years ago, we said to ourselves one day that this would be since there would be 13 or 14 weeks who knows. I remember when we said years ago one day could we have 100 Costco's in the U.S. and we are approaching 500. So it’s by no means, the same as it regular royal spot in terms of capacity a lot lower than that but I just look at more of general to the last couple of years and extrapolate that for the time being.  John Heinbockel Okay, and then and is it too early for next year? Can we think about... Richard Galanti Surely, it's too early I mean it is I mean our goals will be to get towards that but it seems to be challenging this year and but we can work in towards that end. John Heinbockel And then lastly on gross margin so if I look at ancillary ex-gas ancillaries that maybe six or seven basis points so was that anyone department to rise that and sort of how is pharmacy doing within that. And then the major categories within their own sales, so that was improved about five basis points versus last quarter. Is there anything to that or that was fairly broad based? Richard Galanti I think it's more broad based than anything. I think pharmacy is fine. That was sustaining all the challenges with that industry has and we have continued to [indiscernible] putting all there. Now I don’t see if there is anything specific I think it gets more back to the call a quarter ago where we said things are okay and it's not like we have it's changed a lot but these are going to fluctuate some basis points up and down periodically.  John Heinbockel Okay, thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman. Simeon Gutman Hey Richard and thanks for the color on the bigger more K TVs. My serious question is first to get the lien gross profit dynamics for Q4. Can you just give us a sense relative compare. And then I'm going to have one follow-up? Richard Galanti Right, as everyone knows when oil prices go up we make a little less, our margins come down we make a less and when they go down we make a little more year-over-year Q3 that's where the period gas prices generally were going down that was good. But I think the direction when asked on the second quarter call which Q2 haven't been a great comparison with the other way.  We didn’t think it was going to be this good but we would also did know the cash prices have been key down they have gone up lately, so we will see as we had very good profits last year in Q4 some of that has to do there is a trends down towards the end of summer prices in general ex what is going into the market but it's that's why we show every corner and because there is going to be fluctuations that are dictated by what oil prices are doing. Simeon Gutman Got it, okay. And then my follow-up is on the credit card. Can you share with us were about I guess it's almost the year away from cycling the initial I guess the initial change over can you share with us - I know there is a few buckets of margin that we are helping some of its new sign-ups some it's the spend outside of Costco. Can you give us a sense and we lap the initial been effort from last year, what accretes - what the additive and year-over-year versus what it goes away I'm guessing that the bounty's on the new sign-ups will probably fade, but can you just share with us how we should think about it? Richard Galanti Well, I mean generically the biggest bang is in the first year is there a little extra - on the one hand there is little extra because things maybe there were some transition challenges right around there for few weeks okay that's good news going forward for little bit longer. But there was also more incentive and a bigger bank for your bucks and the first time you offer it you get more sign-ups in the first week and the second week than the third week as no more sign-ups being more bounty. So generally speaking, we still think it will be a net accretive if you will or additives to the company in the second year but the big bang is in the first year. Simeon Gutman Okay, thanks. Richard Galanti And if you look at Q4, Q4 there is five or six weeks of the big bang if you will before June 20th and 10 or 11 weeks afterwards so and there is a little bit above the two-thirds of its after that anniversary.  Simeon Gutman Okay, thanks.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser. Michael Lasser My first question is on e-commerce growth which was in the low double-digits in the quarter. Richard are you mindful of maintaining your relevant online especially at a time when other traditional retailers are aggressively growing their e-com presence yet one of your big box competitors talk about 69% e-com growth in the most recent quarter and I believe you are 11% came on an easier comparison it sounds like it flowed throughout the period, so are you mindful of that at all? Richard Galanti I guess I'll use my phrase that I used several times on the last call, not to be arrogant or cavalier about it but we feel good about what we are doing, we have got great brick-and-mortar comps, we are doing things offensively in our view, not defensively on mind and we have got a lot of things going on the online side but we are not really worried about what others are doing and there is lot of good things about online and there is challenges and we are trying to do more of the good things but again we will look into the way we do it, don't expect us to increase by 69% partly through acquisition and we are going to keep doing organically, we think we have got, we made a lot of changes in the last year probably more than we had in the last several years online, and that will show some good results. Michael Lasser My follow-up question is on the group core gross margin being up 20 basis points, that's on the heels of you making some investment in everyday low price in the prior quarter, so did you get the intended effect of those price investments, and is there now an opportunity to do more especially as your gross margin continues to float up? Richard Galanti Well I think the 12 year is 12 on the core, I have already turned that sheet to the side, but look we are going to always do more investing in price, just when you think it's safe to go outside you guys we are going to drive sales top-line and certainly the fact that our margins are strong that we have got upcoming fee increases just starting that we have got additional monies from the credit card, all of those things allow us to do things in an offensive way and drive our business and so we kind of think we can do both, have decent margins and drive our business and lower prices. Michael Lasser I just follow-up on that, because you mentioned the upcoming fee increase in your response to the answering about price investments, should we expect that a good portion more than half would be - that if you get enough fee increase you are going back on the price? Richard Galanti Well I can’t really tell you that, but we are known for giving a lots of things back to the consumer, to remember and it's not completely formulated but we are going to constantly try to excite our members and drive our competitors crazy. Michael Lasser Thank you very much and good luck. Operator Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst Good afternoon Richard. A couple of questions here, first curious that penetration on the new Visa card as you use the tender here in the third quarter and relative to the first half of the year and also curious to where it was relative to when you had the agreement with AmEx? Richard Galanti Well I think we are talking in U.S. dollars because it's a U.S. program, I believe we are in 46 range currently and that's trended up since its inception a year ago, I think the highest we were on AmEx that was with AmEx co-brand, it was -- by the way but that number I'm giving you is all Visa not just Citi Visa because we accept all Visa's and we excepted all AmEx cards, not just the Costco co-brand one, I believe we have got up to the 43, 44 range, and so we have exceeded that but we wouldn't expect it to given the improved value proposition to the member, and the fact that there is just more market share out there and more places probably rewards garden to be used and again more incentive for that part to be used everywhere which helps us as well.  Unidentified Analyst And has the basket changed at all? Richard Galanti I don’t know, and I know there was some anecdotal items in the very beginning at the transition on big ticket items like hearing aids or big screen TVs or furniture but I think the answer is yes it has a probably has a plus sign in front of it is so the minus but not huge and again as more anecdotal stories I have heard I didn’t heard anything big. The biggest thing in terms of the whole part is the fact the inside and outside spend, we are very successful under our own program over 14 or 16 years getting the outside spend on that card up to, to get to 2.5 plus for every dollar spend inside. And that where this issuers all of the issuers wherever the co-brand card is they want more spend on that card because that creates APR that creates carry balances and late fees and everything else, and it's just a big in portfolio. And as we would expect, given the greater market share presence that a Visa has in the market there is going to be more usage if we can get that member to have that as top of wallet there is going to be more usage on it and that's exactly what is happened. Anything that get the expectations have been little better than planning on that. Unidentified Analyst Okay, and just switching gears a little bit Michael's question on e-commerce I think you said 11% growth. Can you just remind us where the penetration is today and also the numbers SKUs that you guys are offering online so we realize you don’t want to have the 350 million that Amazon has, but how big do you think you can grow that and then also on the margin profile the e-commerce business have you believe it's better than your brick-and-mortar margins just wondering if you could clarify that directionally? Richard Galanti Yes, well the sales are about little under 3.5% of sales again is the year that we are going to end up doing just extrapolating the first three quarters something in the mid-120s we had an extra weekend there to this year. And so again it's over a well over 4 billion now. And that's we don’t that's pure e-commerce online we do have delivery online, and we don’t include that we have travel online we don’t include that it's just been normal online that we started with. And I'm sorry, in terms of profitability nothing has really changed their generally speaking the gross margin of dot-com compared to the gross margin of warehouse as gas the four walls of the warehouse, the warehouse is a little higher. The SG&A on dot-com is a lot lower, so the pre-tax earnings of dot-com it is higher and nothing has really changed there. Unidentified Analyst Okay, and just number of SKUs and if you have at the percentage overlap of those SKUs relative to what is in store? Richard Galanti As we had somebody had I think there the SKU challenge ex-office supplies because that's not through a third party and there is 8,000 or 10,000 [Indiscernible] I believe, but I think we have got about 8,000 to 10,000 items and that's exclusive of like - about 2,000 of the roughly 4,000 in the warehouse are online. Unidentified Analyst Okay, perfect. Thanks very much. Richard Galanti And I need to say fresh foods is not online other than through third-parties like Google or like Instacart or like that in Google.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short. Karen Short Hi thanks for taking my question. I just actually trying to get a sense on the gross margin in terms of the MVM. How much was a change in the MVM from Q2 to 3Q or how much of this does year-over-year change in margin-at-margin in 2Q versus 3Q would have been a function of the end game changes and then just wondering what is the number of days on the MVM we can expect in 4Q 2017 versus 4Q 2016? And then I just got another follow-up? Richard Galanti Okay. Well, first of all in terms of the number of days, I think it's like four or less this coming year versus a year ago. Three or four? It's a few days, so not totally meaningful, I mean the big meaningful was in Q2 when it was 17 less on 84 days. And I'm sorry the other question, Karen, the first one you had asked. Karen Short Well when we just look at how the merchandize margin in 2Q versus merchandize margin change in 3Q, I guess how much of the difference I mean sequentially was due to the MVM changes, like the pressure that you had in 2Q versus what we are looking out on 3Q? Richard Galanti I think the biggest change from Q2 year-on-year and Q3 year-on-year was the number of MVM days. we are still being pretty aggressive on the MVM being fewer items with better savings and it's plus a little more if you will that have a seat at the table there from a vendor merchandizing standpoint. But we are also [indiscernible] if we need to - we are not here just to drive margins down, we have got lot of buckets of stuff and when you have increasing kind of inflation and some higher margins areas like fresh foods or some high margins area like pharmacy, those things help as well. But there is something in little pieces that can effect it. Overall we felt pretty good about the Q3 comparison versus the Q2. But there is no material change. Karen Short Okay. And then I guess just as obviously we are kind of getting out of a deflationary period and into flat or maybe slightly inflationary there has just been a lot of questioning as to how deflation impacted your P&L versus how inflation will impact your P&L and I guess I just want to talk through that a little because it would seems to me that deflation, because you had some much tonnage, it actually is a double set, because you have so much more labor involved in meeting the demand. So I don't know if there is any way you try to talk through a little bit on how much more easing I guess you'd have on the P&L as we are no longer in a deflationary period [indiscernible]. Richard Galanti Well I think for low margin retailers and certainly we are at the low end and the lowest end of margins, but super market is well on the food side, a little inflation is good, a little deflation hurts you a little bit it still has the D in front of it, not the IN and so it’s still impacting some. it hurts you most in items like I think the example I gave last quarter was of fresh meats where year-over-year, second quarter or first quarter year-over-year per pound beef was down by 10% and we were selling more than 10% more tonnage and certainly we are having lower gross margin dollars because of that and so as that changes that will help us a little bit. Karen Short Well I guess presumably higher growth SG&A dollars to you because of the labor content, that's kind of where I'm getting at it, there seems like you didn’t have a lot… Richard Galanti Actually on the fresh foods we have higher labor, inflation would help all those things. Karen Short Okay. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem. Zachary Fadem Hi good evening. So, Kirkland Signature continues to perform pretty well, just to what extent is this growth coming at the expense of branded items if any and when you think about positioning the brand going forward are there any areas where you think Kirkland is underpenetrated and work pursuing expansion? Richard Galanti Well, I'm sure of it in term of the expensive branded some of that though in some cases it's the branded manufacturers they are supplying as not always by no means not all the time and but it's another competitor and again we are pretty transparent about it we want brands and private label and so we will continue to see both of those. it really is an item business and some of the success on the - all of the big items I mean paper trails, water, giant items that are 100s of millions as dollar - we have a several items that are billion dollars in unit sales several KS items.  In some cases we have a billion plus dollars on the branded side of the same time, whether it's assortment or bounty and Kirkland Signature one those two items whether it's various regional brand names of order of its Kirkland Signature order. And it works for us and we will continue to do that. Our new category, while I think in the last in the last year or two I think the thing that has done very well for us is the wine and spirits and that continues to have some legs and substantial legs and the good news like other KS items when the brands loose the market share they get sharper on their own prices which with us not only with everybody hopefully which makes it a season more competitive more on the brands. So all of that stuff works in our view will sure benefit and having the brand loyalty certainly helps with membership and wanting them to come back to Costco.  Other areas our voice apparel still has legs if you will and arms I guess. You have got cosmetics organic items and there has been several organic items probably every month of the budget meeting we see new organic items whether its chicken broth or beef broth or some candy caramel chocolate things or nuts clusters and these are $10 million to $25 million whole margin items for us without competitor. In terms of it's not replacing a branded item necessarily. We have done really well in some of the other snack items and energy bar items. We have items where - if a bar I don’t need names here, but if a retail bar, retails for $2 meaning we would sell it for $1.49 we are out there sell the buck on a great item and a full margin for us and providing to some real volume and so I think apparel, cosmetics, health and beauty aids, organic food items not fresh, but packaged food items all those are areas where we continue to I think have some room to grow. Zachary Fadem Okay, thanks for the color. So Richard could you - I know and nothing to beat on e-commerce so again but could you provide some early color on the Instacart and ship partnerships and is there anything notable you could call out regarding customers response or basket sizes versus an in store shop and then just going forward how should we think about potential expansion of these partnerships? Richard Galanti Well it's still a very small piece of our business, but it seems to be working in a sense, since that it's growing for them. We have Google Express which is operates on a five cities with several markets but they are in the process out there of offering as several items in one to three day delivery and we are participating in that with them, so that should be a positive for the program. Instacart has continued to grow dramatically, they currently operate in 40 of our cities up from 26 a year ago utilizing 240 of our warehouses from a 132 a year ago so that's growing, and then there is a few others that I mentioned [indiscernible] was one or something else. Boxed, I don't know if we are doing that, that’s [indiscernible] and look two big ones are Google Instacart and there is not a whole lot of other color, they are working; we want sell merchandizing and they help us do that, but again don't expect us to be doing anything giant and big in one [indiscernible]. Zachary Fadem Got it. Thanks Richard. I appreciate the Time. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler. Matthew Fassler Thanks a lot Richard, good afternoon. First question is a follow-up on inflation, we are seeing overall CPI start to recover, but we have seen the producer price index for PPI come back a little bit faster, are you concerned at all about any kind of gross margin squeeze s or is what you are seeing on the cost front resembling some of those macro indicators or should we just think about the fact that pricing is moving higher and general is being in that positive [indiscernible]. Richard Galanti Pricing move general is net positive, if anything though I think we create some of our own deflationary pressures because we are good at - look at the MVM example, greater value to the member means greater lower prices which means us and our vendor lowering the price some and most of that is driving prices down from our suppliers with the anticipation of significantly more unit volume. The good is, most of time that happens and so that's what we do, but that does drive - those things work, don't always work in concert with the immediate bottom line improvement. Matthew Fassler Understood and then second question, just relates to competition. As Amazon takes 10s and billions of dollars of retail share annually and clearly the biggest share gain or by far the biggest one we have seen in a while. Are you seeing any - obviously your comps overall are increasing at a faster rate than most of the states, is there anything you are seeing in the mix that we might not catch through some of the commentary, that would suggest a change in complexion of how the consumer is really using your store, is it more consumable focused than it had been or is it kind of business as usual with no sign of change in the backdrop? Richard Galanti Look so far, and there is no guarantee in the future, but so far it's been business as usual. There is a number I read few months ago about how Amazon - if the entire U.S. sale, increase in sales or whatever, it was 50 billion they were half of it, well they were, 25 divided by 50 is half, but we were also up, the fact is there is others in the industry that were down 50 billion and so they were a quarter of a 100, minus 50 to plus 50.  That 25 billion is still credible and formidable, but in our view we are fortunate that a lot of the impact is it's impacting some food items or even packaged food items, it's traditional food retail that is getting hit more than us. We have to keep driving our member into our warehouse and we do that with off course great prices and great items certainly fresh foods, certainly gas station and traffic, which brings them into parking lot if you will and certainly the loyalty program which they have on to, all those have been helped us and then the treasure hunt.  We love it when we hear from someone that they heard that we had something, they went the next day and it wasn’t there. well we are still pretty good at all that stuff and I think again the Kirkland Signature help that as well. now so far so good. When we look at the specifics even in markets where whether those Amazon or somebody else is taking share, a lot of were there taking on fracture something, fracture is hard and even they would acknowledge and others. There will be more competition in the future, but who is going to get - we are asked a lot about legal coming into the east coast, they are going to take share, but they are going to take share from everybody else a lot more than they can take share from us. So we haven’t really seen a big change like people are buying less something at Costco because of other formats out there. Matthew Fassler Thank you so much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell. Paul Trussell Hey Richard. On SG&A we have recently cycled some labor investments made a year-ago. Could you just outline for us some other puts and takes we should keep in mind that’s is going to impact the P&L in 4Q and beyond? Richard Galanti I'm sorry could you repeat that. Paul Trussell So on SG&A on the expense front, really just want you to help us think about some puts and takes on the expense side of things in 4Q and beyond especially since we just cycled some of the labor investments you made a year-ago?  Richard Galanti Right, well look the biggest put and take is sales. If we can get another percentage point or two in sales that's always good and that solves a lot of things. When you look at some of the line items payroll is the next one, yes we just anniversaried some of that at the end of March that helps a little bit. Healthcare is still a challenge in the U.S. increasing penetration outside of the U.S. helps that number just by a higher a penetration within the total cost of the company and lot less everywhere else. But again that's going to happen slowly overtime in a positive way, and in some quarters the inflation the U.S. is does more than any small offset to that.  IT expenditures, somebody internally said we probably get the question asked upon it is the zero year-over-year basis point or inflection point, probably not we got to be lucky. Sales were a little higher, we had lot of expenses last year leading up to the end of the fiscal year or day one of the new fiscal year when we installed the new [indiscernible] counting platform on which other things will be built and so we had a lot of third-party contracts, lot of training which you write off, you don’t capitalize and so that will get a little help there. But in fact, it will come down overtime but it's not going to be zero. I think we e-commerce helps a little bit to the extent even at 11% last quarter or 13% or 14% in the first two-thirds of the quarter before the Mothers Day and what have you that's a higher growth rate than the rest of the company. So that a much lower SG&A, so that helps you a little bit. But I think we do pretty well at trying to drive the things in a right direction, but not touching certain things, we are not going to tweak wages a little bit less or does have an increase that’s a little bit less.  We don't do big things like some of those incremental things that anniversary at March like done on scale. We ended that I think in six years, but every three years we look at everything formal way. And so we are still couple of years away from looking again in terms of the big way. I still vote for a sales increase, if you get some extra sales everything else falls in place. Paul Trussell And then just could you speak to Gold Star and overall household membership growth; the growth has slowed a little bit. Just how you are thinking about membership count in the U.S. and also what you are seeing on the international front? Richard Galanti Part of it has to do where we are spending, several of our units in the past couple of years in the U.S. for example that it's do small markets, where you don't give the biggest bang. I think we had one big bang, I gave you example of Tulsa in new market, but that's not as small as some of the markets we want to do. When we open in another Seattle unit which we have two in last couple of -- two and a half years, or in the Greater LA market, it's a great success net of cannibalization. But you don't get a few 1,000 extra members, because everybody is member couple of more frequently because 20 minutes for driving the roadmap 40. We also -- part of the growth depends on how many units we are opening overseas. When we open a new unit in Asia, as of opening date signups paid signups over the eight or 10 or 12 weeks prior and through opening day, you could have 25,000 to 40,000 new members. Iceland although there is only one location in Iceland, as of opening day we had I think over 35,000 members, over 35,000 and it's national news. And so I don't worry looking into the numbers, it's much based on where we have opened, it's not like a life opening compared to two years ago is getting fewer signups. Operator And your next question comes from Scott Mushkin. Scott Mushkin I just want to follow-up on the last question, just a dated question jumped into my head. Are comp memberships actually rising in U.S.? Richard Galanti Comp memberships…you mean comp buildings? Scott Mushkin The memberships going up and…. Richard Galanti I think they are but it's probably a very small number, I mean closer to zero than the number of others. And part of that is when you are opening in a, let's say when we opened in Redmond where Microsoft's headquartered, that cannibalized knowingly three locations, two of them doing in the low to mid 300s a year, and doing in the mid 200s or low 200s a year. We signed up several 1,000 new members, but not 20,000 new members. If we average roughly 62 -- if we are just adding to our membership number of households divided by number of locations, it's about 61,000 or 62,000. And next year of that opening the comp of those three locations is down because some of those members now are allocated to the new rounds. Scott Mushkin So the one I want to just ask about just popping in my head. So how do you think about that as your business matures in the U.S., I mean does that make you want to slow down your center growth I mean how should we frame that, it's maybe the number eventually goes negative? Richard Galanti Maybe it does, I don't think we are there yet. For 25 years people have asked what is your next, whatever -- what is your next fresh foods, what is your next gas station, what is your next pharmacy, what is your next geographic market. Five years ago, I don’t think any of us thought about and I am not assuming us about going into New Orleans, in Baton Rouge, in Mobile and Rochester and Toledo and Tulsa and the like. And we know by the way on average that you are going to be a little slower to take few extra years, but they still have good metrics to them. We have slowed I think using the two examples in Greater Seattle area in last 2.5 to 3 years we have opened Woodville and Redmond we waited on Redmond for 10 years to do knowing that we actually owned land in Redmond 15-20 years ago. But as we opened [indiscernible] there can be in the first one of these sides of CNE and then several years later opened Woodville, which is north of that north of Redmond, we have kept -- we actually sold the land and years ago. And finally -- so we are we try to be pragmatic about what we do. But overtime you are right we haven’t found the bottom, that's the good news. In terms of, again anecdotally, I remember years ago when we have included we needed a minimum of 0.5 million population to serve the warehouse. And then it was 450, now it is 400 and we have the very successful warehouses that you divide the number of households in the community in the population, it's in the very low 200s and if you were in the high 100s. So hopefully we will keep pacing that goal in that direction and that will give us little more life hopefully the business center create some life, and hopefully that term fee is to improve. And hopefully we find couple of more countries. So we think we have got plenty to go and so that changes we'll let you know. Scott Mushkin So then my follow-up question and my real question was I noticed BJs competitor of you has offerings and pretty significant discounts on their memberships. I think you get the first three months free if I am remembering the commercial correctly and $40 for the first year. How do you -- is that matter to you guys I mean you are putting a fee increase through. But a competitor in the northeast and Mid-Atlantic southeast is offering significant discounts. I just wanted to get your comments on that and then all yield? Thanks. Richard Galanti Sure. And I think first if the advertise is good, we don’t advertise we don’t spend on that and we would love seeing add TV and the print adds still from both other competitors. And we are not concerned about it. We think that the value of the Costco is still as significantly higher price or without the free three months is a much better value. And we think that's evidence by our success of what we have done overtime and the fact that even what we have done in the past renewal rates have not really been impacted by it. Operator And your next question is from Brian Nagel. Brian Nagel On the gross margin Richard it was definitely a better performance here than the prior quarter, s going back to the discussion we had on the conference call last quarter. How much of the better performance reflected I guess more stable gas price environment, was that a significant contributing factor to the gross margins this quarter? Richard Galanti Well, the guest helps the margins as did other ancillary business as well. But again to put me in terms the chase, the roughly 80% of our sales which is food, sundries, fresh -- food, sundries, hardlines, soft lines and fresh foods, year-over-year on their own sales they were up 12 basis points. So, it was a lot of different things. Operator And your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli. Scot Ciccarelli Two questions, number one, in terms of the e-commerce business as you guys reach a certain scale. Do you need to change your processes or do you continue to go with the drop ship philosophy? Richard Galanti What relates to what, I didn't hear the first question? Scot Ciccarelli Your e-commerce… Richard Galanti Well, as I mentioned earlier, part of the inventory increase in the Company because we are just rejuvenated by number of warehouses, you give me a number and we'll maybe change that over time. But we had an increase in inventory for e-commerce related stuff, not at the warehouses but we went from seven to 19 distribution points in the last year. So we are getting closer to the customer, we are also working with third parties. I mentioned in the call the GE scheduling system there is other scheduling thing that we are doing. And I mentioned the thing we are testing right now in our Bedford Illinois Business Center. I mentioned last quarter where in addition to 50 or 70 mile radius where we deliver with Costco truck through third party, there is one or three day delivery to 17 states all the way to the Pennsylvania New Jersey. And so if anything I think we are getting it's getting quicker and cheaper to do these things for us. And maybe we started off high and begin with how we baked and how we did it, but we are improving. Scot Ciccarelli And then second question is hopefully this is an easy calculation here. We look at the debt redemption the issuance, looks like you guys would be incurring about 25 million more a year in interest cost call it 6 million a quarter. Should that just be a pretty straight calculation or is there something else we should keep in mind as we kind of work on our model? Richard Galanti I did a back of the envelop this morning and I came in with a number that's few million higher that still has two in front of it. Now it's pretty straightforward I mean you've got 3.8 billion tons somewhere between 260 and 270, call it 265 it’s a rounded number, you've to pay down of the March debt that we did, which was 60 million a year savings, you've got the call, shortly of the 1.1 billion, 108% that's on the interest expense line, a little bit of an offset will be the cash. As you know we borrowed 38, roughly 31 is the dividend, the others 700 is cash earning less than net interest rate, and even less than the one that’s coming up. But it all moves up to something like you said, if you go back to the March where we had in place the March 2017 5.5%. Operator Your next question is from Oliver Chen. Oliver Chen Our question is on multi vendor mailer, how are you feeling about what you've been doing in terms of testing and learning; and that the MVM product versus the product that you are offering at every day values? It's been -- I know you are thinking about how to optimize that appropriately; so just curious about the status of that? And the second question is about the mobile app, and Amazon has a really good mobile app. So what features do you want to have in your mobile app over time that you don't have now? Thank you. Richard Galanti I want to get back to you on the latter question. Just because I don't have something here you can help me on that one. The first one, I forgot now, what was it? Oliver Chen The monthly vendor mailer…. Richard Galanti I think we feel good about it. I think as I have said on the last call, something as we enhanced the value and kept in the multi vendor mailer and items some of the things we took out and did everyday little pricing on; sometimes it's still better value based on and the vendor working towards that end and to have it more prominent, so there is lots of different things. It was 12 weeks ago that I said to you and many of you on the phone things are fine, there is a few things that impacted us a little more or something that didn’t work. I think we have improved on all of those things but we will continue to do that it's been only as we haven’t solve family answered everything but we feel good about what is happened in the last 12 weeks as it relate to that question. Oliver Chen Richard, lastly on traffic and store traffic you've been able to do a great job on the multiyear basis with physical store traffic. What are some of the opportunities ahead or what are some of the plans you have just aim to sustain that in a sustainable healthily growing manner? And how do we or should we be more cautious because it's been still good on a multiyear basis. Just it's something we monitor and it's been impressive for you to achieve such good store traffic in a tough environment. Richard Galanti Well, this is where we go all shocks. And I think we are going to keep focusing on driving value of items and identify the item that makes sense. And I mean it as many of you known us for years as we have said many times, it's the good news it's a lot of little things. Even gasoline is a lot of little things today, because it had a big help for several years in the U.S. -- in Canada for few years. We now have about a dozen plus unit at the gas stations and countries like Japan and Australia, and soon a couple of other countries. And not everywhere, but it's now a lot of its little extra thing in some of those countries. I think the wine and spirit thing has caught us off guard in a positive way that what started as a few line items a number of years ago we are actually receiving rewards on price points that are nobody can match and the trust to the brand. On the spirit side, we never thought we would be successful, and it's a double positive because it's not only selling us the full margin private label item but it's creditors the brands don’t like losing market share to us and they want to get look better on pricing at Costco, so all those things had helped us. I think the apparel area as I have mentioned has been something we hadn’t thought about it. But over the last two or three years, it's a $5 plus billion business that's been growing at 9% compound it's 3.5 years. And that has more lives even though retail apparel was weak. And so we will keep coming up with stuff. I think the first trend that our traffic went from a boring 4.2 compound for seven calendar years '09 through '15 and then it hit 38, 35, 33, 28 and everybody is saying Bob and I others were the first to say, this could very well be the durable not just punch on it but 4.2 is pretty hard to do. With that being said we feel really -- where we got some things for traffic drivers and fresh food still has legs, JS still has legs, gasoline still has legs executive membership so the credit card extra value. So we feel pretty good about -- that's in a way or not quantitative answer but all things are relatively sorted. Oliver Chen Richard, you have very talented merchant. Did Amazon is trying to hire them is that something that comes up in terms of that capability being such a competitive advantage? Richard Galanti I would hope not. To my knowledge, we lost one or two merchants but not in the last few years. We lose a few IT engineers several of whom 18 months of the date call us back after they hit their [indiscernible]. But that's everywhere I mean look Amazon is in our town and they hire a lot of people from every company in town and out of town. We have been fortunate, people have chosen to stick around but the answer is no, we haven't. But we cross our fingers to you in the future. Operator And the next question is from Kelly Bania. Kelly Bania Just another one with e-commerce, I think you mentioned that you've expanded some KS items online. Just wondering if you could elaborate what categories those are. And really just what is the pricing strategy with online versus in-store for those items that I think you said 2,000 items that crossover. I mean should we expect prices are the same or is there a difference in pricing strategy online versus in the club? Thanks. Richard Galanti Sometimes online they don't hire for delivery, sometimes as we tried some, what call them velocity apparel items, stocks and shirts and things. We need to some of that ourselves in terms of shipping as we want to get people comfortable ordering velocity items, whether its apparel or health and beauty aids or sundries like Jacobs. And unfortunately, I don't have the list in front of me and some of the new items with several KS items, but other brands as well. And again give me a call after the holiday -- I just don't have that information with me. Kelly Bania And then can I just ask one more just clarification on gross margin. I think when you talked about the core gross margin the up 7 up 20 with and without gas that includes the 16 basis points from the Citi Visa but the up 12 the 80 basis or the 80% of the core business, up 12, that excludes the Citi Visa. Is that correct? Richard Galanti That’s correct, yes. Operator And your next question is from Peter Benedict. Peter Benedict Richard, just a couple of quick ones, MFI trends, some underlying slowing there I mean is that just a friction from the new card changeovers or are you seeing anything in terms of signups that's concerning you? Richard Galanti The biggest issue is re-openings in the quarter, actually two net openings. One was there so no, nothing that's terribly -- that's concerning. Nothing that is dis-concerning, I shouldn't have used the word terribly. Peter Benedict Second question, the lift in comp that you've seen over the last several months recovering comp trends; has there been anything in terms of business members versus Gold Star, anything like that that has kind of disproportionately driven that? Richard Galanti No, not really. Peter Benedict And then my last question is just around the e-commerce fulfillment centers, just get 19 of those. Where do you see that number going in the next few years? And then could the clubs actually be used for that whether you said 2,000 items that are in the clubs that are also offered online, can the clubs to be used to sell that delivery of those? Richard Galanti First of all, going from 7 to 19 has a lot. And again, we are more than saving on that because we are getting the stuff to you quicker. We are spending less on freight we did it somewhat inefficiently to start with. There’ll be more -- I don’t that's I don’t know if -- I just know what those few data points for 7 and 19. The other question was where we ever use the warehouses fulfillment centers, yes sure. And I'm saying that not suggesting it's going to happen tomorrow. And one of the things we are doing with the Bedford, Illinois Business Center in a way is e-commerce related, you order online and it will be deliver in one to three days via third party carrier; certain items, I mean I think the items have certain weight and size limitations we are not to be delivering sofas to New Jersey from there. But probably we will be delivering that but using the business centers like using a warehouse and different set of items, but it was easy to do because it will set up at some ways to accommodate it fat. And we’ll see, but it's logical to think that would you have some of allocations around the country that could do some things at night when they closed or a low volume unit that could help out. But we haven’t -- don’t expect anything on that front for at least the next year, and I would always suggesting to next year that this we haven’t really talked about and a lot of other than could we. Operator And your next question is from Greg Melich. Greg Melich Richard, could you fill us in on what gas was the percentage of sales. And I think you said the gallons comp positive and if you have the number that would be great. And I have follow-up? Richard Galanti It was okay we are almost there. Greg Melich Should I go with the next question? Richard Galanti Yes. Greg Melich Okay, so the other question I just want to make sure I get the timing of Visa fitting and how that came in last year. So it is the 36 bps of help to the EBIT margin, if I get this right. And in the fourth quarter, we should probably get another four or five weeks of that benefit. Am I thinking about that right or is there some other thing at work, if I remember correctly, as you are running out the Amex program you were not signing up people and not getting the payments for signing up people for the card? Or is it just the straight forward think about that got a few more weeks of the benefit cycles? Richard Galanti I think it's like six weeks, not just three or four but then you get -- there was 220 that we have some disruption around it. We are also conservative on some of the assumptions. I mean look it’s not going to be nearly as it was in the last three quarters, but it's not going to be a quarter is the only of quarters base. In terms of the gallon comps, it's a very strong number. It has two digits but not -- is very low two digits, so I can't tell you anything. Greg Melich Low single digits, and gas a percentage of total company sales? Richard Galanti Yes, hold on a second… Greg Melich And maybe why you are digging that out, since I got -- the membership fee growth in local currencies, how much effect that line? Richard Galanti First of all gas is a little under 10% and the other one was membership fees, that was in my -- membership fees reported was up 4% in dollars, or $26 million and 5% without FX. FX was a $3.6 million hit to the number. FX should have been flatter -- the number would have been $3.6 million higher. Operator And your next question is from Edward Kelly. Edward Kelly Richard, just a couple of quick one for you entail on here, on the gross margin in Q4. Is there any extra leverage from the extra week in Q4 that we should expect, that's meaningful at all? Richard Galanti Nothing. The margin very little on the expense side almost nothing. Edward Kelly And then on just a follow-up on fresh food, just provide maybe more color on what is tied up here in terms of things you've been talking about, particularly in organics. And is there any kind of step change or just continuation of what you've been doing? Richard Galanti Global store sales -- being the largest purveyor of USDA prime beef in the universe and we are now -- in the U.S. we are something like a third of all U.S. prime beef sales. Before ’08, vast majority of all prime beef sales went to restaurants and hotels. Edward Kelly And how are you doing on capacity and some items in produce from an organic standpoint that maybe you struck a little bit in the past? Richard Galanti I think, overall, and not just us but everybody has benefitted in fact there is more supply out there. I think we feel competitively from a standpoint that we are well positioned because I think we have used the number on produce. We source produce from 44 countries, nobody does that and that gives us some additional advantage in that area. But it's gotten less hard but it's still organic as -- there is more demand than there is supply. But if I look at the price points of organic versus conventional, on most items, the premium is still a premium but not as big a premium that it was two years ago because of the fact that there is less of a supply demand imbalance.

Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel. John Heinbockel So Richard, first topic expansion and business centers. So you have added some more there is couple of coming here in the next month or so. How do you think about business centers versus regular clubs number one? And when you think about is there a big potential business center expansion here. And then lastly on expansion when you think about, is it too early to think about 2018 and we sort of get back to 30 openings worldwide next year? Richard Galanti Well, first of all with regard to the business centers, I think we started the year with 14 and signed up four this year so 18, that should be up by 1, and are first in Canada, we call that we had business centers for, I think we are going from four or five to seven or eight over about 10 plus years. And so we continue to be hit and news say we have found something that seems to work now and then there is a little method to that madness.  And but it’s corollary to what our primary businesses is opening full Costco membership warehouses. And we were continue to open more, but I think again this is guess at this point. But on assuming the base at end of the year is 18 that should be up one using that two to seven or two to six or three to five, I mean, that will be in that range for the next couple of years. We are not looking to go from 14 to 18 to 28 in a year.  And so far so good, I think a couple of years ago, we said to ourselves one day that this would be since there would be 13 or 14 weeks who knows. I remember when we said years ago one day could we have 100 Costco's in the U.S. and we are approaching 500. So it’s by no means, the same as it regular royal spot in terms of capacity a lot lower than that but I just look at more of general to the last couple of years and extrapolate that for the time being.  John Heinbockel Okay, and then and is it too early for next year? Can we think about... Richard Galanti Surely, it's too early I mean it is I mean our goals will be to get towards that but it seems to be challenging this year and but we can work in towards that end. John Heinbockel And then lastly on gross margin so if I look at ancillary ex-gas ancillaries that maybe six or seven basis points so was that anyone department to rise that and sort of how is pharmacy doing within that. And then the major categories within their own sales, so that was improved about five basis points versus last quarter. Is there anything to that or that was fairly broad based? Richard Galanti I think it's more broad based than anything. I think pharmacy is fine. That was sustaining all the challenges with that industry has and we have continued to [indiscernible] putting all there. Now I don’t see if there is anything specific I think it gets more back to the call a quarter ago where we said things are okay and it's not like we have it's changed a lot but these are going to fluctuate some basis points up and down periodically.  John Heinbockel Okay, thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman. Simeon Gutman Hey Richard and thanks for the color on the bigger more K TVs. My serious question is first to get the lien gross profit dynamics for Q4. Can you just give us a sense relative compare. And then I'm going to have one follow-up? Richard Galanti Right, as everyone knows when oil prices go up we make a little less, our margins come down we make a less and when they go down we make a little more year-over-year Q3 that's where the period gas prices generally were going down that was good. But I think the direction when asked on the second quarter call which Q2 haven't been a great comparison with the other way.  We didn’t think it was going to be this good but we would also did know the cash prices have been key down they have gone up lately, so we will see as we had very good profits last year in Q4 some of that has to do there is a trends down towards the end of summer prices in general ex what is going into the market but it's that's why we show every corner and because there is going to be fluctuations that are dictated by what oil prices are doing. Simeon Gutman Got it, okay. And then my follow-up is on the credit card. Can you share with us were about I guess it's almost the year away from cycling the initial I guess the initial change over can you share with us - I know there is a few buckets of margin that we are helping some of its new sign-ups some it's the spend outside of Costco. Can you give us a sense and we lap the initial been effort from last year, what accretes - what the additive and year-over-year versus what it goes away I'm guessing that the bounty's on the new sign-ups will probably fade, but can you just share with us how we should think about it? Richard Galanti Well, I mean generically the biggest bang is in the first year is there a little extra - on the one hand there is little extra because things maybe there were some transition challenges right around there for few weeks okay that's good news going forward for little bit longer. But there was also more incentive and a bigger bank for your bucks and the first time you offer it you get more sign-ups in the first week and the second week than the third week as no more sign-ups being more bounty. So generally speaking, we still think it will be a net accretive if you will or additives to the company in the second year but the big bang is in the first year. Simeon Gutman Okay, thanks. Richard Galanti And if you look at Q4, Q4 there is five or six weeks of the big bang if you will before June 20th and 10 or 11 weeks afterwards so and there is a little bit above the two-thirds of its after that anniversary.  Simeon Gutman Okay, thanks.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser. Michael Lasser My first question is on e-commerce growth which was in the low double-digits in the quarter. Richard are you mindful of maintaining your relevant online especially at a time when other traditional retailers are aggressively growing their e-com presence yet one of your big box competitors talk about 69% e-com growth in the most recent quarter and I believe you are 11% came on an easier comparison it sounds like it flowed throughout the period, so are you mindful of that at all? Richard Galanti I guess I'll use my phrase that I used several times on the last call, not to be arrogant or cavalier about it but we feel good about what we are doing, we have got great brick-and-mortar comps, we are doing things offensively in our view, not defensively on mind and we have got a lot of things going on the online side but we are not really worried about what others are doing and there is lot of good things about online and there is challenges and we are trying to do more of the good things but again we will look into the way we do it, don't expect us to increase by 69% partly through acquisition and we are going to keep doing organically, we think we have got, we made a lot of changes in the last year probably more than we had in the last several years online, and that will show some good results. Michael Lasser My follow-up question is on the group core gross margin being up 20 basis points, that's on the heels of you making some investment in everyday low price in the prior quarter, so did you get the intended effect of those price investments, and is there now an opportunity to do more especially as your gross margin continues to float up? Richard Galanti Well I think the 12 year is 12 on the core, I have already turned that sheet to the side, but look we are going to always do more investing in price, just when you think it's safe to go outside you guys we are going to drive sales top-line and certainly the fact that our margins are strong that we have got upcoming fee increases just starting that we have got additional monies from the credit card, all of those things allow us to do things in an offensive way and drive our business and so we kind of think we can do both, have decent margins and drive our business and lower prices. Michael Lasser I just follow-up on that, because you mentioned the upcoming fee increase in your response to the answering about price investments, should we expect that a good portion more than half would be - that if you get enough fee increase you are going back on the price? Richard Galanti Well I can’t really tell you that, but we are known for giving a lots of things back to the consumer, to remember and it's not completely formulated but we are going to constantly try to excite our members and drive our competitors crazy. Michael Lasser Thank you very much and good luck. Operator Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst Good afternoon Richard. A couple of questions here, first curious that penetration on the new Visa card as you use the tender here in the third quarter and relative to the first half of the year and also curious to where it was relative to when you had the agreement with AmEx? Richard Galanti Well I think we are talking in U.S. dollars because it's a U.S. program, I believe we are in 46 range currently and that's trended up since its inception a year ago, I think the highest we were on AmEx that was with AmEx co-brand, it was -- by the way but that number I'm giving you is all Visa not just Citi Visa because we accept all Visa's and we excepted all AmEx cards, not just the Costco co-brand one, I believe we have got up to the 43, 44 range, and so we have exceeded that but we wouldn't expect it to given the improved value proposition to the member, and the fact that there is just more market share out there and more places probably rewards garden to be used and again more incentive for that part to be used everywhere which helps us as well.  Unidentified Analyst And has the basket changed at all? Richard Galanti I don’t know, and I know there was some anecdotal items in the very beginning at the transition on big ticket items like hearing aids or big screen TVs or furniture but I think the answer is yes it has a probably has a plus sign in front of it is so the minus but not huge and again as more anecdotal stories I have heard I didn’t heard anything big. The biggest thing in terms of the whole part is the fact the inside and outside spend, we are very successful under our own program over 14 or 16 years getting the outside spend on that card up to, to get to 2.5 plus for every dollar spend inside. And that where this issuers all of the issuers wherever the co-brand card is they want more spend on that card because that creates APR that creates carry balances and late fees and everything else, and it's just a big in portfolio. And as we would expect, given the greater market share presence that a Visa has in the market there is going to be more usage if we can get that member to have that as top of wallet there is going to be more usage on it and that's exactly what is happened. Anything that get the expectations have been little better than planning on that. Unidentified Analyst Okay, and just switching gears a little bit Michael's question on e-commerce I think you said 11% growth. Can you just remind us where the penetration is today and also the numbers SKUs that you guys are offering online so we realize you don’t want to have the 350 million that Amazon has, but how big do you think you can grow that and then also on the margin profile the e-commerce business have you believe it's better than your brick-and-mortar margins just wondering if you could clarify that directionally? Richard Galanti Yes, well the sales are about little under 3.5% of sales again is the year that we are going to end up doing just extrapolating the first three quarters something in the mid-120s we had an extra weekend there to this year. And so again it's over a well over 4 billion now. And that's we don’t that's pure e-commerce online we do have delivery online, and we don’t include that we have travel online we don’t include that it's just been normal online that we started with. And I'm sorry, in terms of profitability nothing has really changed their generally speaking the gross margin of dot-com compared to the gross margin of warehouse as gas the four walls of the warehouse, the warehouse is a little higher. The SG&A on dot-com is a lot lower, so the pre-tax earnings of dot-com it is higher and nothing has really changed there. Unidentified Analyst Okay, and just number of SKUs and if you have at the percentage overlap of those SKUs relative to what is in store? Richard Galanti As we had somebody had I think there the SKU challenge ex-office supplies because that's not through a third party and there is 8,000 or 10,000 [Indiscernible] I believe, but I think we have got about 8,000 to 10,000 items and that's exclusive of like - about 2,000 of the roughly 4,000 in the warehouse are online. Unidentified Analyst Okay, perfect. Thanks very much. Richard Galanti And I need to say fresh foods is not online other than through third-parties like Google or like Instacart or like that in Google.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short. Karen Short Hi thanks for taking my question. I just actually trying to get a sense on the gross margin in terms of the MVM. How much was a change in the MVM from Q2 to 3Q or how much of this does year-over-year change in margin-at-margin in 2Q versus 3Q would have been a function of the end game changes and then just wondering what is the number of days on the MVM we can expect in 4Q 2017 versus 4Q 2016? And then I just got another follow-up? Richard Galanti Okay. Well, first of all in terms of the number of days, I think it's like four or less this coming year versus a year ago. Three or four? It's a few days, so not totally meaningful, I mean the big meaningful was in Q2 when it was 17 less on 84 days. And I'm sorry the other question, Karen, the first one you had asked. Karen Short Well when we just look at how the merchandize margin in 2Q versus merchandize margin change in 3Q, I guess how much of the difference I mean sequentially was due to the MVM changes, like the pressure that you had in 2Q versus what we are looking out on 3Q? Richard Galanti I think the biggest change from Q2 year-on-year and Q3 year-on-year was the number of MVM days. we are still being pretty aggressive on the MVM being fewer items with better savings and it's plus a little more if you will that have a seat at the table there from a vendor merchandizing standpoint. But we are also [indiscernible] if we need to - we are not here just to drive margins down, we have got lot of buckets of stuff and when you have increasing kind of inflation and some higher margins areas like fresh foods or some high margins area like pharmacy, those things help as well. But there is something in little pieces that can effect it. Overall we felt pretty good about the Q3 comparison versus the Q2. But there is no material change. Karen Short Okay. And then I guess just as obviously we are kind of getting out of a deflationary period and into flat or maybe slightly inflationary there has just been a lot of questioning as to how deflation impacted your P&L versus how inflation will impact your P&L and I guess I just want to talk through that a little because it would seems to me that deflation, because you had some much tonnage, it actually is a double set, because you have so much more labor involved in meeting the demand. So I don't know if there is any way you try to talk through a little bit on how much more easing I guess you'd have on the P&L as we are no longer in a deflationary period [indiscernible]. Richard Galanti Well I think for low margin retailers and certainly we are at the low end and the lowest end of margins, but super market is well on the food side, a little inflation is good, a little deflation hurts you a little bit it still has the D in front of it, not the IN and so it’s still impacting some. it hurts you most in items like I think the example I gave last quarter was of fresh meats where year-over-year, second quarter or first quarter year-over-year per pound beef was down by 10% and we were selling more than 10% more tonnage and certainly we are having lower gross margin dollars because of that and so as that changes that will help us a little bit. Karen Short Well I guess presumably higher growth SG&A dollars to you because of the labor content, that's kind of where I'm getting at it, there seems like you didn’t have a lot… Richard Galanti Actually on the fresh foods we have higher labor, inflation would help all those things. Karen Short Okay. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem. Zachary Fadem Hi good evening. So, Kirkland Signature continues to perform pretty well, just to what extent is this growth coming at the expense of branded items if any and when you think about positioning the brand going forward are there any areas where you think Kirkland is underpenetrated and work pursuing expansion? Richard Galanti Well, I'm sure of it in term of the expensive branded some of that though in some cases it's the branded manufacturers they are supplying as not always by no means not all the time and but it's another competitor and again we are pretty transparent about it we want brands and private label and so we will continue to see both of those. it really is an item business and some of the success on the - all of the big items I mean paper trails, water, giant items that are 100s of millions as dollar - we have a several items that are billion dollars in unit sales several KS items.  In some cases we have a billion plus dollars on the branded side of the same time, whether it's assortment or bounty and Kirkland Signature one those two items whether it's various regional brand names of order of its Kirkland Signature order. And it works for us and we will continue to do that. Our new category, while I think in the last in the last year or two I think the thing that has done very well for us is the wine and spirits and that continues to have some legs and substantial legs and the good news like other KS items when the brands loose the market share they get sharper on their own prices which with us not only with everybody hopefully which makes it a season more competitive more on the brands. So all of that stuff works in our view will sure benefit and having the brand loyalty certainly helps with membership and wanting them to come back to Costco.  Other areas our voice apparel still has legs if you will and arms I guess. You have got cosmetics organic items and there has been several organic items probably every month of the budget meeting we see new organic items whether its chicken broth or beef broth or some candy caramel chocolate things or nuts clusters and these are $10 million to $25 million whole margin items for us without competitor. In terms of it's not replacing a branded item necessarily. We have done really well in some of the other snack items and energy bar items. We have items where - if a bar I don’t need names here, but if a retail bar, retails for $2 meaning we would sell it for $1.49 we are out there sell the buck on a great item and a full margin for us and providing to some real volume and so I think apparel, cosmetics, health and beauty aids, organic food items not fresh, but packaged food items all those are areas where we continue to I think have some room to grow. Zachary Fadem Okay, thanks for the color. So Richard could you - I know and nothing to beat on e-commerce so again but could you provide some early color on the Instacart and ship partnerships and is there anything notable you could call out regarding customers response or basket sizes versus an in store shop and then just going forward how should we think about potential expansion of these partnerships? Richard Galanti Well it's still a very small piece of our business, but it seems to be working in a sense, since that it's growing for them. We have Google Express which is operates on a five cities with several markets but they are in the process out there of offering as several items in one to three day delivery and we are participating in that with them, so that should be a positive for the program. Instacart has continued to grow dramatically, they currently operate in 40 of our cities up from 26 a year ago utilizing 240 of our warehouses from a 132 a year ago so that's growing, and then there is a few others that I mentioned [indiscernible] was one or something else. Boxed, I don't know if we are doing that, that’s [indiscernible] and look two big ones are Google Instacart and there is not a whole lot of other color, they are working; we want sell merchandizing and they help us do that, but again don't expect us to be doing anything giant and big in one [indiscernible]. Zachary Fadem Got it. Thanks Richard. I appreciate the Time. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler. Matthew Fassler Thanks a lot Richard, good afternoon. First question is a follow-up on inflation, we are seeing overall CPI start to recover, but we have seen the producer price index for PPI come back a little bit faster, are you concerned at all about any kind of gross margin squeeze s or is what you are seeing on the cost front resembling some of those macro indicators or should we just think about the fact that pricing is moving higher and general is being in that positive [indiscernible]. Richard Galanti Pricing move general is net positive, if anything though I think we create some of our own deflationary pressures because we are good at - look at the MVM example, greater value to the member means greater lower prices which means us and our vendor lowering the price some and most of that is driving prices down from our suppliers with the anticipation of significantly more unit volume. The good is, most of time that happens and so that's what we do, but that does drive - those things work, don't always work in concert with the immediate bottom line improvement. Matthew Fassler Understood and then second question, just relates to competition. As Amazon takes 10s and billions of dollars of retail share annually and clearly the biggest share gain or by far the biggest one we have seen in a while. Are you seeing any - obviously your comps overall are increasing at a faster rate than most of the states, is there anything you are seeing in the mix that we might not catch through some of the commentary, that would suggest a change in complexion of how the consumer is really using your store, is it more consumable focused than it had been or is it kind of business as usual with no sign of change in the backdrop? Richard Galanti Look so far, and there is no guarantee in the future, but so far it's been business as usual. There is a number I read few months ago about how Amazon - if the entire U.S. sale, increase in sales or whatever, it was 50 billion they were half of it, well they were, 25 divided by 50 is half, but we were also up, the fact is there is others in the industry that were down 50 billion and so they were a quarter of a 100, minus 50 to plus 50.  That 25 billion is still credible and formidable, but in our view we are fortunate that a lot of the impact is it's impacting some food items or even packaged food items, it's traditional food retail that is getting hit more than us. We have to keep driving our member into our warehouse and we do that with off course great prices and great items certainly fresh foods, certainly gas station and traffic, which brings them into parking lot if you will and certainly the loyalty program which they have on to, all those have been helped us and then the treasure hunt.  We love it when we hear from someone that they heard that we had something, they went the next day and it wasn’t there. well we are still pretty good at all that stuff and I think again the Kirkland Signature help that as well. now so far so good. When we look at the specifics even in markets where whether those Amazon or somebody else is taking share, a lot of were there taking on fracture something, fracture is hard and even they would acknowledge and others. There will be more competition in the future, but who is going to get - we are asked a lot about legal coming into the east coast, they are going to take share, but they are going to take share from everybody else a lot more than they can take share from us. So we haven’t really seen a big change like people are buying less something at Costco because of other formats out there. Matthew Fassler Thank you so much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell. Paul Trussell Hey Richard. On SG&A we have recently cycled some labor investments made a year-ago. Could you just outline for us some other puts and takes we should keep in mind that’s is going to impact the P&L in 4Q and beyond? Richard Galanti I'm sorry could you repeat that. Paul Trussell So on SG&A on the expense front, really just want you to help us think about some puts and takes on the expense side of things in 4Q and beyond especially since we just cycled some of the labor investments you made a year-ago?  Richard Galanti Right, well look the biggest put and take is sales. If we can get another percentage point or two in sales that's always good and that solves a lot of things. When you look at some of the line items payroll is the next one, yes we just anniversaried some of that at the end of March that helps a little bit. Healthcare is still a challenge in the U.S. increasing penetration outside of the U.S. helps that number just by a higher a penetration within the total cost of the company and lot less everywhere else. But again that's going to happen slowly overtime in a positive way, and in some quarters the inflation the U.S. is does more than any small offset to that.  IT expenditures, somebody internally said we probably get the question asked upon it is the zero year-over-year basis point or inflection point, probably not we got to be lucky. Sales were a little higher, we had lot of expenses last year leading up to the end of the fiscal year or day one of the new fiscal year when we installed the new [indiscernible] counting platform on which other things will be built and so we had a lot of third-party contracts, lot of training which you write off, you don’t capitalize and so that will get a little help there. But in fact, it will come down overtime but it's not going to be zero. I think we e-commerce helps a little bit to the extent even at 11% last quarter or 13% or 14% in the first two-thirds of the quarter before the Mothers Day and what have you that's a higher growth rate than the rest of the company. So that a much lower SG&A, so that helps you a little bit. But I think we do pretty well at trying to drive the things in a right direction, but not touching certain things, we are not going to tweak wages a little bit less or does have an increase that’s a little bit less.  We don't do big things like some of those incremental things that anniversary at March like done on scale. We ended that I think in six years, but every three years we look at everything formal way. And so we are still couple of years away from looking again in terms of the big way. I still vote for a sales increase, if you get some extra sales everything else falls in place. Paul Trussell And then just could you speak to Gold Star and overall household membership growth; the growth has slowed a little bit. Just how you are thinking about membership count in the U.S. and also what you are seeing on the international front? Richard Galanti Part of it has to do where we are spending, several of our units in the past couple of years in the U.S. for example that it's do small markets, where you don't give the biggest bang. I think we had one big bang, I gave you example of Tulsa in new market, but that's not as small as some of the markets we want to do. When we open in another Seattle unit which we have two in last couple of -- two and a half years, or in the Greater LA market, it's a great success net of cannibalization. But you don't get a few 1,000 extra members, because everybody is member couple of more frequently because 20 minutes for driving the roadmap 40. We also -- part of the growth depends on how many units we are opening overseas. When we open a new unit in Asia, as of opening date signups paid signups over the eight or 10 or 12 weeks prior and through opening day, you could have 25,000 to 40,000 new members. Iceland although there is only one location in Iceland, as of opening day we had I think over 35,000 members, over 35,000 and it's national news. And so I don't worry looking into the numbers, it's much based on where we have opened, it's not like a life opening compared to two years ago is getting fewer signups. Operator And your next question comes from Scott Mushkin. Scott Mushkin I just want to follow-up on the last question, just a dated question jumped into my head. Are comp memberships actually rising in U.S.? Richard Galanti Comp memberships…you mean comp buildings? Scott Mushkin The memberships going up and…. Richard Galanti I think they are but it's probably a very small number, I mean closer to zero than the number of others. And part of that is when you are opening in a, let's say when we opened in Redmond where Microsoft's headquartered, that cannibalized knowingly three locations, two of them doing in the low to mid 300s a year, and doing in the mid 200s or low 200s a year. We signed up several 1,000 new members, but not 20,000 new members. If we average roughly 62 -- if we are just adding to our membership number of households divided by number of locations, it's about 61,000 or 62,000. And next year of that opening the comp of those three locations is down because some of those members now are allocated to the new rounds. Scott Mushkin So the one I want to just ask about just popping in my head. So how do you think about that as your business matures in the U.S., I mean does that make you want to slow down your center growth I mean how should we frame that, it's maybe the number eventually goes negative? Richard Galanti Maybe it does, I don't think we are there yet. For 25 years people have asked what is your next, whatever -- what is your next fresh foods, what is your next gas station, what is your next pharmacy, what is your next geographic market. Five years ago, I don’t think any of us thought about and I am not assuming us about going into New Orleans, in Baton Rouge, in Mobile and Rochester and Toledo and Tulsa and the like. And we know by the way on average that you are going to be a little slower to take few extra years, but they still have good metrics to them. We have slowed I think using the two examples in Greater Seattle area in last 2.5 to 3 years we have opened Woodville and Redmond we waited on Redmond for 10 years to do knowing that we actually owned land in Redmond 15-20 years ago. But as we opened [indiscernible] there can be in the first one of these sides of CNE and then several years later opened Woodville, which is north of that north of Redmond, we have kept -- we actually sold the land and years ago. And finally -- so we are we try to be pragmatic about what we do. But overtime you are right we haven’t found the bottom, that's the good news. In terms of, again anecdotally, I remember years ago when we have included we needed a minimum of 0.5 million population to serve the warehouse. And then it was 450, now it is 400 and we have the very successful warehouses that you divide the number of households in the community in the population, it's in the very low 200s and if you were in the high 100s. So hopefully we will keep pacing that goal in that direction and that will give us little more life hopefully the business center create some life, and hopefully that term fee is to improve. And hopefully we find couple of more countries. So we think we have got plenty to go and so that changes we'll let you know. Scott Mushkin So then my follow-up question and my real question was I noticed BJs competitor of you has offerings and pretty significant discounts on their memberships. I think you get the first three months free if I am remembering the commercial correctly and $40 for the first year. How do you -- is that matter to you guys I mean you are putting a fee increase through. But a competitor in the northeast and Mid-Atlantic southeast is offering significant discounts. I just wanted to get your comments on that and then all yield? Thanks. Richard Galanti Sure. And I think first if the advertise is good, we don’t advertise we don’t spend on that and we would love seeing add TV and the print adds still from both other competitors. And we are not concerned about it. We think that the value of the Costco is still as significantly higher price or without the free three months is a much better value. And we think that's evidence by our success of what we have done overtime and the fact that even what we have done in the past renewal rates have not really been impacted by it. Operator And your next question is from Brian Nagel. Brian Nagel On the gross margin Richard it was definitely a better performance here than the prior quarter, s going back to the discussion we had on the conference call last quarter. How much of the better performance reflected I guess more stable gas price environment, was that a significant contributing factor to the gross margins this quarter? Richard Galanti Well, the guest helps the margins as did other ancillary business as well. But again to put me in terms the chase, the roughly 80% of our sales which is food, sundries, fresh -- food, sundries, hardlines, soft lines and fresh foods, year-over-year on their own sales they were up 12 basis points. So, it was a lot of different things. Operator And your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli. Scot Ciccarelli Two questions, number one, in terms of the e-commerce business as you guys reach a certain scale. Do you need to change your processes or do you continue to go with the drop ship philosophy? Richard Galanti What relates to what, I didn't hear the first question? Scot Ciccarelli Your e-commerce… Richard Galanti Well, as I mentioned earlier, part of the inventory increase in the Company because we are just rejuvenated by number of warehouses, you give me a number and we'll maybe change that over time. But we had an increase in inventory for e-commerce related stuff, not at the warehouses but we went from seven to 19 distribution points in the last year. So we are getting closer to the customer, we are also working with third parties. I mentioned in the call the GE scheduling system there is other scheduling thing that we are doing. And I mentioned the thing we are testing right now in our Bedford Illinois Business Center. I mentioned last quarter where in addition to 50 or 70 mile radius where we deliver with Costco truck through third party, there is one or three day delivery to 17 states all the way to the Pennsylvania New Jersey. And so if anything I think we are getting it's getting quicker and cheaper to do these things for us. And maybe we started off high and begin with how we baked and how we did it, but we are improving. Scot Ciccarelli And then second question is hopefully this is an easy calculation here. We look at the debt redemption the issuance, looks like you guys would be incurring about 25 million more a year in interest cost call it 6 million a quarter. Should that just be a pretty straight calculation or is there something else we should keep in mind as we kind of work on our model? Richard Galanti I did a back of the envelop this morning and I came in with a number that's few million higher that still has two in front of it. Now it's pretty straightforward I mean you've got 3.8 billion tons somewhere between 260 and 270, call it 265 it’s a rounded number, you've to pay down of the March debt that we did, which was 60 million a year savings, you've got the call, shortly of the 1.1 billion, 108% that's on the interest expense line, a little bit of an offset will be the cash. As you know we borrowed 38, roughly 31 is the dividend, the others 700 is cash earning less than net interest rate, and even less than the one that’s coming up. But it all moves up to something like you said, if you go back to the March where we had in place the March 2017 5.5%. Operator Your next question is from Oliver Chen. Oliver Chen Our question is on multi vendor mailer, how are you feeling about what you've been doing in terms of testing and learning; and that the MVM product versus the product that you are offering at every day values? It's been -- I know you are thinking about how to optimize that appropriately; so just curious about the status of that? And the second question is about the mobile app, and Amazon has a really good mobile app. So what features do you want to have in your mobile app over time that you don't have now? Thank you. Richard Galanti I want to get back to you on the latter question. Just because I don't have something here you can help me on that one. The first one, I forgot now, what was it? Oliver Chen The monthly vendor mailer…. Richard Galanti I think we feel good about it. I think as I have said on the last call, something as we enhanced the value and kept in the multi vendor mailer and items some of the things we took out and did everyday little pricing on; sometimes it's still better value based on and the vendor working towards that end and to have it more prominent, so there is lots of different things. It was 12 weeks ago that I said to you and many of you on the phone things are fine, there is a few things that impacted us a little more or something that didn’t work. I think we have improved on all of those things but we will continue to do that it's been only as we haven’t solve family answered everything but we feel good about what is happened in the last 12 weeks as it relate to that question. Oliver Chen Richard, lastly on traffic and store traffic you've been able to do a great job on the multiyear basis with physical store traffic. What are some of the opportunities ahead or what are some of the plans you have just aim to sustain that in a sustainable healthily growing manner? And how do we or should we be more cautious because it's been still good on a multiyear basis. Just it's something we monitor and it's been impressive for you to achieve such good store traffic in a tough environment. Richard Galanti Well, this is where we go all shocks. And I think we are going to keep focusing on driving value of items and identify the item that makes sense. And I mean it as many of you known us for years as we have said many times, it's the good news it's a lot of little things. Even gasoline is a lot of little things today, because it had a big help for several years in the U.S. -- in Canada for few years. We now have about a dozen plus unit at the gas stations and countries like Japan and Australia, and soon a couple of other countries. And not everywhere, but it's now a lot of its little extra thing in some of those countries. I think the wine and spirit thing has caught us off guard in a positive way that what started as a few line items a number of years ago we are actually receiving rewards on price points that are nobody can match and the trust to the brand. On the spirit side, we never thought we would be successful, and it's a double positive because it's not only selling us the full margin private label item but it's creditors the brands don’t like losing market share to us and they want to get look better on pricing at Costco, so all those things had helped us. I think the apparel area as I have mentioned has been something we hadn’t thought about it. But over the last two or three years, it's a $5 plus billion business that's been growing at 9% compound it's 3.5 years. And that has more lives even though retail apparel was weak. And so we will keep coming up with stuff. I think the first trend that our traffic went from a boring 4.2 compound for seven calendar years '09 through '15 and then it hit 38, 35, 33, 28 and everybody is saying Bob and I others were the first to say, this could very well be the durable not just punch on it but 4.2 is pretty hard to do. With that being said we feel really -- where we got some things for traffic drivers and fresh food still has legs, JS still has legs, gasoline still has legs executive membership so the credit card extra value. So we feel pretty good about -- that's in a way or not quantitative answer but all things are relatively sorted. Oliver Chen Richard, you have very talented merchant. Did Amazon is trying to hire them is that something that comes up in terms of that capability being such a competitive advantage? Richard Galanti I would hope not. To my knowledge, we lost one or two merchants but not in the last few years. We lose a few IT engineers several of whom 18 months of the date call us back after they hit their [indiscernible]. But that's everywhere I mean look Amazon is in our town and they hire a lot of people from every company in town and out of town. We have been fortunate, people have chosen to stick around but the answer is no, we haven't. But we cross our fingers to you in the future. Operator And the next question is from Kelly Bania. Kelly Bania Just another one with e-commerce, I think you mentioned that you've expanded some KS items online. Just wondering if you could elaborate what categories those are. And really just what is the pricing strategy with online versus in-store for those items that I think you said 2,000 items that crossover. I mean should we expect prices are the same or is there a difference in pricing strategy online versus in the club? Thanks. Richard Galanti Sometimes online they don't hire for delivery, sometimes as we tried some, what call them velocity apparel items, stocks and shirts and things. We need to some of that ourselves in terms of shipping as we want to get people comfortable ordering velocity items, whether its apparel or health and beauty aids or sundries like Jacobs. And unfortunately, I don't have the list in front of me and some of the new items with several KS items, but other brands as well. And again give me a call after the holiday -- I just don't have that information with me. Kelly Bania And then can I just ask one more just clarification on gross margin. I think when you talked about the core gross margin the up 7 up 20 with and without gas that includes the 16 basis points from the Citi Visa but the up 12 the 80 basis or the 80% of the core business, up 12, that excludes the Citi Visa. Is that correct? Richard Galanti That’s correct, yes. Operator And your next question is from Peter Benedict. Peter Benedict Richard, just a couple of quick ones, MFI trends, some underlying slowing there I mean is that just a friction from the new card changeovers or are you seeing anything in terms of signups that's concerning you? Richard Galanti The biggest issue is re-openings in the quarter, actually two net openings. One was there so no, nothing that's terribly -- that's concerning. Nothing that is dis-concerning, I shouldn't have used the word terribly. Peter Benedict Second question, the lift in comp that you've seen over the last several months recovering comp trends; has there been anything in terms of business members versus Gold Star, anything like that that has kind of disproportionately driven that? Richard Galanti No, not really. Peter Benedict And then my last question is just around the e-commerce fulfillment centers, just get 19 of those. Where do you see that number going in the next few years? And then could the clubs actually be used for that whether you said 2,000 items that are in the clubs that are also offered online, can the clubs to be used to sell that delivery of those? Richard Galanti First of all, going from 7 to 19 has a lot. And again, we are more than saving on that because we are getting the stuff to you quicker. We are spending less on freight we did it somewhat inefficiently to start with. There’ll be more -- I don’t that's I don’t know if -- I just know what those few data points for 7 and 19. The other question was where we ever use the warehouses fulfillment centers, yes sure. And I'm saying that not suggesting it's going to happen tomorrow. And one of the things we are doing with the Bedford, Illinois Business Center in a way is e-commerce related, you order online and it will be deliver in one to three days via third party carrier; certain items, I mean I think the items have certain weight and size limitations we are not to be delivering sofas to New Jersey from there. But probably we will be delivering that but using the business centers like using a warehouse and different set of items, but it was easy to do because it will set up at some ways to accommodate it fat. And we’ll see, but it's logical to think that would you have some of allocations around the country that could do some things at night when they closed or a low volume unit that could help out. But we haven’t -- don’t expect anything on that front for at least the next year, and I would always suggesting to next year that this we haven’t really talked about and a lot of other than could we. Operator And your next question is from Greg Melich. Greg Melich Richard, could you fill us in on what gas was the percentage of sales. And I think you said the gallons comp positive and if you have the number that would be great. And I have follow-up? Richard Galanti It was okay we are almost there. Greg Melich Should I go with the next question? Richard Galanti Yes. Greg Melich Okay, so the other question I just want to make sure I get the timing of Visa fitting and how that came in last year. So it is the 36 bps of help to the EBIT margin, if I get this right. And in the fourth quarter, we should probably get another four or five weeks of that benefit. Am I thinking about that right or is there some other thing at work, if I remember correctly, as you are running out the Amex program you were not signing up people and not getting the payments for signing up people for the card? Or is it just the straight forward think about that got a few more weeks of the benefit cycles? Richard Galanti I think it's like six weeks, not just three or four but then you get -- there was 220 that we have some disruption around it. We are also conservative on some of the assumptions. I mean look it’s not going to be nearly as it was in the last three quarters, but it's not going to be a quarter is the only of quarters base. In terms of the gallon comps, it's a very strong number. It has two digits but not -- is very low two digits, so I can't tell you anything. Greg Melich Low single digits, and gas a percentage of total company sales? Richard Galanti Yes, hold on a second… Greg Melich And maybe why you are digging that out, since I got -- the membership fee growth in local currencies, how much effect that line? Richard Galanti First of all gas is a little under 10% and the other one was membership fees, that was in my -- membership fees reported was up 4% in dollars, or $26 million and 5% without FX. FX was a $3.6 million hit to the number. FX should have been flatter -- the number would have been $3.6 million higher. Operator And your next question is from Edward Kelly. Edward Kelly Richard, just a couple of quick one for you entail on here, on the gross margin in Q4. Is there any extra leverage from the extra week in Q4 that we should expect, that's meaningful at all? Richard Galanti Nothing. The margin very little on the expense side almost nothing. Edward Kelly And then on just a follow-up on fresh food, just provide maybe more color on what is tied up here in terms of things you've been talking about, particularly in organics. And is there any kind of step change or just continuation of what you've been doing? Richard Galanti Global store sales -- being the largest purveyor of USDA prime beef in the universe and we are now -- in the U.S. we are something like a third of all U.S. prime beef sales. Before ’08, vast majority of all prime beef sales went to restaurants and hotels. Edward Kelly And how are you doing on capacity and some items in produce from an organic standpoint that maybe you struck a little bit in the past? Richard Galanti I think, overall, and not just us but everybody has benefitted in fact there is more supply out there. I think we feel competitively from a standpoint that we are well positioned because I think we have used the number on produce. We source produce from 44 countries, nobody does that and that gives us some additional advantage in that area. But it's gotten less hard but it's still organic as -- there is more demand than there is supply. But if I look at the price points of organic versus conventional, on most items, the premium is still a premium but not as big a premium that it was two years ago because of the fact that there is less of a supply demand imbalance. Operator And there're no further questions. Richard Galanti Well, thank you everyone. Have a good afternoon, and holiday. Operator And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Baird Jeff Goldstein - Morgan Stanley Operator Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Hansen Thank you and good evening. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2017. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report that revenue for the third quarter, which ended February 28th was $1.281 billion, an increase of 5.3% over last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of work days was 6.5%. New business wins; penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains strong. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment accelerated to a rate of 7.3%. Third quarter gross margin improved to 44.2% from 43.1% last year. As Cintas Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer stated in this afternoon's press release, this is our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. This and our industry leading revenue growth are indicative of a healthy company, with significant opportunities ahead. We thank our employees whom we call partners for best in class execution and results. Gross margin of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment improved to 45%, an increase of 100 basis points, compared to last year's third quarter. The First Aid and Safety segment gross margin improved to 44.8%, a year-over-year increase of 260 basis points, due to the realization of synergies from the acquisition of ZEE Medical in fiscal 2016. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter, compared to 27.3% in last year's third quarter. 50 basis points of the increase was the result of a difficult comparison due to favorable workers' comp experience in the prior year's third quarter. In addition, labor and related expenses increased as a percentage of revenue as we continue to prepare for the acquisition of G&K Services. Operating income for the third quarter of $195 million increased 0.9% from last year's third quarter. Operating income margin was 15.2%, compared to 15.9% in last year's third quarter. Third quarter operating income included $9 million or 0.7% of third quarter revenue of transaction expenses related to the previously announced agreement to acquire G&K. Excluding this G&K transaction related expense, our operating income margin was 15.9%. We're pleased with our incremental profit margins. Note that our third quarter had one less work day than last year. That's had negative impact of approximately 40 to 50 basis points on this year's operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation and amortization being determined on a monthly basis instead of a work day basis. In addition, as Paul will soon discuss in greater detail, energy had a negative impact on this year's third quarter operating margin of 50 basis points. So, to put it in perspective, excluding G&K transaction expenses, operating margin was same as last year's third quarter, despite about 100 basis points of headwinds from one less work day in energy. Net income and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the third quarter were $119 million, and $1.08 respectively. This quarter's EPS, included a positive $0.03 impact from a change in the accounting for equity compensation, as required under ASU 2016-09. Remember that this benefit shows up in the way of the lower effective tax rate, offset by higher equity compensation expense and share counts. We also had a $0.06 negative impact from expenses related to the G&K transaction, such as legal and professional expenses associated with the regulatory review. Exclusive of these items, EPS was $1.11. Yesterday, we closed on the acquisition of G&K. First and most importantly, I want to welcome our new partners from G&K. We look forward to getting to know you better and we remain very excited about this opportunity. As we have discussed, we continue to expect annual synergies in the range of $130 million to $140 million in the full year following the acquisition. We will now begin the process of integrating the two companies together. As Scott Farmer indicated in today's press release, we have pulled our revenue and EPS guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017, because we need to complete the purchase accounting process and confirm our assumption used in estimating non-recurring costs. For example, in an acquisition of this size, we are required to use a third party to value our intangibles. There can be a fairly wide range of outcomes in this type of analysis, and we won't know that outcome until the third party completes its process. Another example is that we need to record all G&K fixed assets and inventory as fair value. Much of this work is performed by a third-party firm. Again, we will not know these values until the process is completed. In the absence of this information, providing a meaningful guidance range for our fourth fiscal quarter is not possible at this time. Paul will soon provide additional details of the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Paul though, I wanted to add that we are very pleased with our third quarter results. Excluding the impact of the G&K acquisition that will come in our fourth quarter, our third quarter results keep us on pace to attain the annual guidance previously provided, and to achieve a seventh consecutive year of organic growth in the mid to high single digits with double digit growth in EPS. I’ll now turn the call over to Paul. Paul Adler Thank you, Mike. First please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains one less work day than fiscal year 2016. As Mike stated, it was this quarter, the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that had one less day in the prior year quarter. One less day will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points, and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. The negative impact on the fiscal 2017 third quarter was about 40 to 50 basis points of revenue growth and about 40 to 50 basis points of operating margin. Our fiscal fourth quarter contained 66 work days, the same number in the prior year fourth quarter. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All other consist primarily of fire protection services and our direct sale business. First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $993 million, an increase of 6.1% compared to last year’s third quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, acquisitions and work day differences, the organic growth rate was 7.3%, compared to 6.5% last quarter. We continue to see the impact of weakness in the oil, gas and coal industry. However, as we predicted on last quarter’s earnings call, the impact has lessened. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 60 basis points in the third quarter. This compares to about a 75-basis point headwind in the previous quarter. Our Uniform Rental and Facilities Services segment gross margin was 45.0% for the third quarter, an increase of 100 basis points from 44.0% in last year’s third quarter. Energy related costs were about 20 basis points higher than in last year’s third quarter. In addition, job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment’s current year third quarter operating margin by about 30 basis points. So, on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 50 basis points. Keep in mind that margins were also negatively impacted by one less day of revenue. Therefore, gross margin expansion of 100 basis points was achieved despite about 100 basis points of headwind from one less work day and energy. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products, and Training. This segment’s revenue for the third quarter was $124 million, which was 4.4% higher than last year’s third quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 5.5%. Last quarter, we disclosed that we believe that the First Aid segment organic growth rate hit the bottom and the segment was positioned for improving organic growth rates. Acceleration in the organic growth rate from 3.3% in the second quarter to 5.5% this quarter was expected. Route consolidation and optimization have been completed. We previously disclosed that we added sales reps in our first quarter. ZEE Medical did not have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relied only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps will help us grow the acquired customer base through penetration with our broad range of products and services. We expect improving organic growth rates through the remainder of this fiscal year. This segment’s gross margin was 44.8% in the third quarter, compared to 42.2% in last year’s third quarter, an increase of 260 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses. Our year-to-date gross margin dollars are up 51% over two years ago, and up 18% over last year. Our year-to-date gross margin percentage is almost back to pre-ZEE levels and our revenue of course is significantly greater. Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $163 million, an increase of 1.9% compared to last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate was 2.4%. All Other gross margin was 39.1% for the third quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 38.9% for last year's third quarter. The direct sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are such as Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid. Therefore, the growth rates are generally low and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million-dollar account. Our Fire business however continues to grow at a consistently rapid pace. The fire business organic growth rate was just short of 10%.  As Mike stated earlier, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter compared to 27.3% in last year's third quarter. 50 basis points of the increase was the result of the difficult comparison due to favorable workers' compensation experience in the prior year third quarter. We're self-insured, which can result in some volatility from time-to-time. In addition, labor and related expenses increased as a percentage of revenue, as we continued to prepare for the acquisition of G&K. Finally, this year's third quarter includes SAP expenses amounting to about 20 basis points of revenue. Regarding SAP, since last quarter's earnings call more locations have been converted. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. Due to the acquisition of G&K, we are planning and adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary.  Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter was 34.5%, compared to 33.8% for last year's third quarter. This year's third quarter rate is lower than historical rates due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on stock compensation. Note that last year's third quarter effective tax rate benefited from the closing of a federal tax audit with favorable results. Our cash balances as of February 28, were $147 million, and we had no marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from investing, or rather cash flow from operating activities in the current year quarter was $182 million, and free cash flow was about $119 million. Uses of cash in the third quarter included CapEx and payments of our regular annual dividend.  Capital expenditures for the third quarter were about $63 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows. $55 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $5 million in First Aid and Safety and $3 million in All Other. As of February 28, total debt was about $1.1 billion, consisting of $399 million in short term debt and $745 million of long-term debt. Subsequent to quarter end, debt increased about $2.3 billion to fund the acquisition of G&K. Sources of acquisition funds included the following; $100 million of G&K senior notes, $50 million of additional existing Cintas senior notes due in 2022, $1 billion of senior notes due in 2027, $650 million of senior notes due in 2022, a new term loan of $250 million and commercial paper of about $250 million. With this additional debt, we estimate that our leverage has increased to about 3.1 times debt to EBITDA. Our goal is to reduce our leverage to 2 times debt to EBITDA within three years. With $300 million of senior notes maturing in December that we will not refinance; $250 million of term loan and $250 million of commercial paper, we have structured our debt appropriately to achieve the goal. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're happy to answer your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari The first question is just on customer attrition. Are you guys baking in any customer attrition post the G&K deal? Obviously, that's closed now. And any thoughts on the Uniform market potentially getting incrementally more competitive, as you work to integrate that deal? Mike Hansen Well, Hamzah, I would say that the industry is always very competitive and it will continue to be so. As it relates to the customer attrition or retention, I don't know that I expect much of a difference there, but let me speak a little bit towards revenue; our thoughts on revenue in general. So, when we think about the Cintas business as we move forward, we have no expectations for change. We continue to expect growth in that mid-to-high single-digits. When we think about the G&K revenue though, you can think about it in terms of there's a new business component, there is the kind of customer penetration, and there's a lost business or attrition component, in the normal course of doing business. And as we move forward, we're going to continue to have that customer attrition that we've seen in -- that G&K has seen historically, and that we'll likely see continue into the future. There will likely be a little bit of an increase due to disruption of the integration, but generally speaking I would say not a lot of change. The difference though will be the new business component. So as you can kind of think about new business and the G&K sales team over the course of the last seven months, they have been trying to sell in an environment where selling a five-year contract under kind of an uncertain future is, as you could imagine is quite difficult. So the new business component certainly has been pressured quite a bit over the last seven months. As we move into now the post-closing process, that momentum carries into our post-closing process. In addition, as we think about their sales people, you can imagine that the difficulty in selling new business and contractual new business in the environment resulted in some attrition. And so as we move forward, we will need to hire new people to replace some of those sales people, but also train all of their sales people as we move forward. So training them on selling our products and services, training them on our systems, using our processes et cetera and there certainly will be a productivity -- a negative productivity impact. So as we look forward, we will continue to probably see the normal customer attrition that the business has seen, maybe a little bit higher. But we will also see some significant pressures on the new business. And so as we think about that moving forward, our experience has been for years and years that we will see some pressure to the point where we may see revenue come down in the 5% to 10% range over the course of the next year or so. Hamzah Mazari That’s extremely helpful. And just a follow up question. Are there any divestitures build into your cost synergy target number of 130 to 140 or is that something you are working through right now? Mike Hansen There were no divestitures baked into that assumption. Operator Our next question comes from Gary Bissey with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jay Hanna Hi, this is actually Jay Hanna on for Garry today. I was wondering if you guys could give a little more detailed look at what the pace of those cost synergies will be? And maybe a more detailed timeline for the full integration of G&K within Cintas as well? Mike Hansen Well, as you probably have seen, we talked about $130 million to $140 million in annual synergies, fully realized in year four. We have also talked about this being fully accretive or accretive in our second full year. That would be our fiscal '19. As we move forward, we certainly have had a lot of assumptions about those synergies, but I will tell you over the course of the last seven months, one thing that I need to make sure is clear, is we have been operating as two separate companies, and that was a requirement, so that we were not jumping ahead of the regulatory process. And I tell you that because we are just now -- we just closed yesterday. We are just now getting into the confirming of our assumptions, and we need to do that before we can provide more timing, more specific timing on the synergies. But we do feel like we will be accretive in year two, and in year one we are going to have some onetime expenses that are non-recurring in nature; things like rebranding, asset impairments, severance, lease breakage type thing and we're going to be going to work over the course of the next several months, really confirming what those amounts will be. Once we do that, once we confirm our assumptions for the integration plan, we'll have a better idea of what fiscal '18 will look like and our expectation would be we certainly share that in July. But having said all of that, we certainly do think that there will be synergies in year one. We’re just not ready to provide any specific numbers. Jay Hanna Great. And then excluding the acquisition and following in this quarter, you spoke to it a little bit earlier. But do you think full year ’17 guidance, would it remain the same or possibly increase following third quarter? Mike Hansen I would say that we would likely have either left them the same or possibly narrowed by bringing the bottoms up a little bit. So third quarter, we are very pleased with the third quarter. I think we’ve got some nice momentum and execution going on in the business and we are poised to have a good fourth quarter. Operator And we’ll take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Joe Box Yes. Hey guys. So I was hoping to dig into the 80 basis points sequential pick-up in organic growth for Uniform. Looks like there was about 15 basis points sequential tailwind from less oil and gas drag. So can you maybe put a little bit more color on the non-oil and gas improvement, really just aside from calling out ancillary products and better customer retention? Paul Adler Yes. Joe, it’s Paul. You are right, the 15 basis points is part of the math. I would say in addition to that, we had a very good strong quarter from a new business perspective, especially as it related to garments. And so not only do you benefit from the new business in terms of that additional recurring revenue, that you will receive from the garments going forward over these five-year agreements, but we have new business installed related to garments. You also have some good revenue in terms of peripheral charges, incentive fees and emblem costs. So that definitely helped as well. But really outside of that Joe, there was nothing extraordinary. It’s just the continuation of execution that the game plan, quality service, retention remained strong, a very strong organic revenue growth quarter, something we’re proud of, given all the excitement of the pending acquisition. But just continuation of what we’ve done the last six years of growing top-line and that 5% to 7% organically, and again proud of those growth rates compared to the competition, which has been posting much, much smaller organic growth rates. Joe Box I appreciate it Paul. And then just a question on guidance. I guess, I’m just curious, why not provide a non-cash goal post here. So purchase accounting is really kind of the biggest unknown. And then I guess just from an expectation standpoint, should we think about maybe an inter-quarter 8-K with guidance, once you guys get the third-party valuations done or should we be thinking about this as being maybe a more 4Q call type item? Mike Hansen As a relates to why not provide some sort of guidance, whether it’s cash or something else. Joe, we’re going to get busy right away and we’re going to get busy on the integration items. And as we do that, the businesses blur. It’s not like we’re going to go through the next two and slightly over two months and have two distinct businesses still by the end. They are going to get blurred, because we’re bringing them together and we’re going to be doing quite a bit of integration work. And it just -- it becomes very, very difficult to keep those pieces separate. And because of that we're not -- I don’t like the idea of trying to dissect that. If we do come up with the purchase accounting results during the quarter and we feel that we're in a position to provide them, you may see us do that, but our first goal is to really understand it and get it right and then provide. Joe Box Understood, and I do appreciate that the lines will get blurred here, but I assume that the fiscal year 4Q revenue guidance for standalone Cintas probably is still generally intact. Is that fair? Mike Hansen As we've talked about, yes. We think that's fair and it probably -- we would probably have narrowed it by bringing the bottom up. We feel good about the fourth quarter and the third quarter I think is very indicative of the second half of the year that we expected to have. So yes, the answer to your question is yes.  Operator [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman Hi, would you be willing to talk how long you think the amortization period will be. And in year one if it wasn't for the amortization, would the merger be accretive? Mike Hansen The amortization period will be 10 years most likely. We expect that to be in the range of about 3% to 4% of the deal value. And would it be accretive without that? I think yes. I think the answer Andrew is yes, that you can kind a think about that as a what, $66 million to $88 million annual number. It will be fairly a large non-cash number.  Operator Our next question comes from Minaz Putnik with Barclays.  Minaz Putnik  Thank you, good evening gentlemen, and firstly congratulations on getting the deal done. So I appreciate -- I think why you I guess retracted the guidance to '17. And just to your point on calling out that amortization as a non-cash number in Q4. Going forward when you guys do initiate '18 guidance, will you be -- if not giving sort of the cash EPS number at least call out all these non-cash charges pretty clearly for us to calculate that? Mike Hansen That will be our goal yes. We will likely provide GAAP guidance but we will -- our goal will be to give you some of these large items to give you a sense of what the performance detail will look like. Minaz Putnik Okay that would be very helpful. And then just on the organic performance, another strong quarter obviously. Just like how you describe the three components for G&K in terms of new business penetration and retention, or attrition, can you just help lay that out in terms of where the growth is coming for Cintas standalone right now? Paul Adler Definitely new businesses continue to be the strongest driver of the growth. As we've said it, new business in terms of new customers; we're still selling that 60/40 split of 60% of the new business wins, our new programmers versus the 40% taking market share. So that's been very consistent through this year and really in the near past as well. New business also includes the penetration of our existing customers. That is certainly part of our vision and that continues at a very good pace. A lot of the hygiene products that we've talked about in the past, our Sanis signature series, new offering in the last couple of years, that's really helped us with penetration. Retention has been roughly 95%. So still strong, no significant change in that. So, really no significant movement in any of the key component of organic growth drivers. Minaz Putnik And that 40% share gain you talked about, does that typically end up being from the smaller regional players or do they -- or is it a broad mix with the national players as well? Mike Hansen No, it's a broad mix of wins versus small, medium, large competitors. Operator Our next question comes from George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Adrian Paz Hi this is Adrian Paz calling for George. I just have question on the G&K transaction. Can you provide -- on the synergies, can you provide the breakdown of what's going to be revenue synergies versus what's going to be synergies? Mike Hansen We have not included any revenue synergies in that $130 million to $140 million. Those are cost synergies and they come in four primary buckets and in no particular order. We think of them in terms of material cost. So, a sourcing benefit. We think of them in terms of production improvements. So, the more efficient use of capacity. We think of them in terms of the route density allowing us to use less fuel because of more dense routes. And then we think about it in terms of overhead and the reduction of duplicate overhead. Did not include any revenue synergies in that amount. And one of the reasons we didn’t is because we need to get through the integration work. We need to get them on to our systems. We need to optimize the routes and we need to have our new G&K partners really trained and comfortable in selling our product line, and that takes a little bit of time. Adrian Paz And on the -- so with the SAP implementation, do you expect your cost savings from the SAP platform to be bigger within the G&K transaction or are your estimates since then? Mike Hansen We do expect the benefit to be bigger. We are -- first of all the additional revenue certainly provides better leverage over the system. But certainly, operating on one system in total certainly will create additional benefits for us. And the better visibility into all of our new customers will certainly help us in terms of identifying cross seller penetration opportunities, identifying where certain industries we are -- customers in certain industries where we believe we have got a good product mix to provide value, but certain customers in that industry don’t have some of those. We think there is a lot of opportunity, and certainly by adding the G&K volume, that certainly helps it out. Paul Adler And to add to that. More benefits and then really not a lot of significant additional costs; that's the beauty of the acquisition. Just another positive is that we get to leverage G&K over that existing $140 million spend. So, we'll have some have additional licensing costs, nominal amount but the capital investment is not going to increase. Adrian Paz And if I could just ask one more, on the non-programming market or the no-programmer market, how do you think about that market and how much growth you believe is available there and do those declines have the margin profile as your existing clients? Mike Hansen We think there is a lot of runway there. As Paul said about two thirds of our new business comes from that no-programmer segment, and it's been that way for a long time. The -- we have talked a little bit about what that no-programmer may look like. It could be outdoor trades, people that are now renting our Carhartt products. It could be culinary people now renting our Chef Works product, it could be healthcare workers now renting our scrub rental programs. There are lots of opportunities there and there will continue to be. The margin profile is I would say is not significantly different from any other type of account, but certainly we know that with all of our customers the more penetration that we can take -- that we can have, the product and services that we can add to them, the more valuable those stocks become. Usually the lesser the probability that they leave us because we are more fully penetrated. So once we sell any account, penetration becomes really important afterwards. Operator And our next question comes from Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Justin Hauke I just wanted to talk a little bit more about maybe how does think about revenue synergies, and I guess the reason why I ask is obviously you guys have been very successful in broadening out services that you offered. You are acquiring 170,000 customers here. Is there a difference, and maybe you can give us the number of average services you sell to your current customers and how that compared to G&K; so we can kind of think about what the incremental opportunity to sell into that base is? And I guess related to that also would be, is there any material difference in the 95% retention rate that you have and the retention rate that maybe you are acquiring here? Mike Hansen I would -- so first of all, I don’t know the penetration of G&K. Again, we haven’t had visibility and insight until really starting today, and we’ll start to learn that more and more. So it’s hard for me to try to estimate what any revenue penetration might be. We have told -- we have talked a lot about, if you think about our Uniform Rental customers for example, the highest penetrated item is our mats, entrance mats. And I would say about 60% of our Uniform Rental customers have entrance mats. That doesn’t mean they have as many as we believe that they should we have, but it means they have at least some presence in the entrance mat. In addition to that, all of our other products are less than 20% penetrated. So we have a lot of runway on our own and I would suspect that G&K’s profile is from a Uniform Rental and match, is probably not a lot different than ours, although that is purely a guess. And I would say that the broader line for us likely in the hygiene and the chemical cleaning First Aid and Safety Fire Protection, those become nice opportunities. I don’t have any kind of information as far as qualifying that, because we just don’t know enough about those customers. And an example would be, I want to see, or we would want to see the profile of the G&K customers. And that’s when we start to analyze or look for the opportunities in terms of what are the products and services we can provide to that. So we need some time to be able to do that. As it relates to your second question of retention, again don’t have specifics on that, but I would say that they are probably not two different from ours. Although, I would suggest that because our growth rate is so much higher than the industry in general, that our retention is likely a little bit better. Justin Hauke Okay, great. No, I understand it’s still early. So that’s fair, and we’ll look forward to learning more about it, as you learn more about it. I guess just two more mechanical questions into modeling purposes. First, are you planning on reporting all of G&K in the rental segment or should we think that some of it goes in the other business? And how much of it would go there? And then second, the SAP cost that you previously outlined, the 40 million to 45 million for 2018, how should we think about that number, now that you’re bringing in G&K? Is that still the right number or does it have to be larger than that? Mike Hansen So your first question is, yes. I would say almost all of that revenue and operating income would fall into the rental segment. As it relates to the second question, we will give some thoughts on SAP, when we provide our guidance in July. But I would suggest that it’s going to be lower than 40 to 45 for -- probably because, we’ve seen that we’ve been a little bit more efficient this year than we expected. And the additional -- any additional costs related to an integration of G&K will come in the way of length and integration or implementation process. So I wouldn't expect that it drives up our costs in fiscal '18. I would just -- I think we talked a little bit about it drives the implementation process into fiscal '19. So we'll see a little bit of -- a little bit more expense in '19 than we initially expected, because of the duration with G&K. But again, the process has been going well and we've been spending less than we expected, and I would expect that results in lower numbers for '18.  Operator [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.  Jeff Goldstein Hey this is actually Jeff Goldstein on for Toni. I wanted to piggyback a little bit on an earlier question. One of your primary competitors called out industry weakness in the most recently completed quarter. Can you just comment on what you're seeing in the marketplace, why you think you continue to have more; and if you've seen any type of irrational behavior among competitors, maybe in anticipation of your merger with G&K. Mike Hansen I would say from a -- what are we seeing differently. From an economic standpoint, I would say that our third quarter from an economy standpoint didn't really feel any different than our first two quarters of this fiscal year, other than there has been a lot of sentiment about maybe the new administration being a little bit more pro-business et cetera. But I would say I'm not sure that's translated much into what we've seen on the street. Having said that it's been a constructive environment, and with the exception of the oil and gas vertical, which we've in fact seen get a little bit better, we haven't seen much of a change one way or the other. And because of that, as you've seen, we've continued to execute well and continued at maybe organic growth levels of the first half of the year and in fact even a little bit better. And I think that is simply as Paul mentioned good execution, good new business productivity. Our sales people are doing a great job.  As it relates to your second question of are we seeing any irrational behavior, I would just say that it's always very competitive. Once we get into the to talk more of our G&K partners, we may find that it's -- it was a probably a little bit more aggressive on G&K customers. But we certainly know when an acquisition is announced the competition gets very aggressive around the acquired customers. And I would say that's kind part for the course. Jeff Goldstein Okay. And then can you just provide a little more color on the sequential decline in First Aid margins and what the big driver of that beyond just the one fewer workday? And then just longer term, do you think the First Aid segment could ever close the margin gap with rental or do you see kind of structural differences in those businesses of that. Paul Adler Yes Jeff, First Aid we were pleased with the results overall. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we felt like last quarter that we had hit a bottom, and that became reality and then we expect those organic growth rates to continue to climb. That business should grow in the high single-digits. That's what it grew coming into ZEE, and that's what we expect going forward. In terms of the margins though, we're -- the gross margins continue to improve. We mentioned in the prepared remarks, how much the dollars are up over couple of years, 50 some odd percent, 18% year-over-year increase in gross margin dollars. The incremental gross margins have been very strong. Last year they were in the 30% range. This year last two quarters they were 100%. So gross margins are moving along as we expected, as we continue to realize those synergies. SG&A we do have a little bit of heavier investment in the selling part of that component. As we mentioned in our first quarter we invested in the sales force to be able to grow that acquired big block of ZEE business. And they've only been there what, a quarter or two at most. They'll continue to become more productive; they'll grow that top line, we'll get that leverage and so we are optimistic about not only the top line growth but the margin improvement going forward. Mike Hansen I think Jeff, as Paul mentioned, we've made an investment in our sales team there. ZEE did not have a sales team and so we've -- as we came out of the system conversion, it was time to start really selling in a little bit more -- well, in higher volumes and that's what we did. We invested to be able to do that. Do we have the confidence that those margins can get into those mid to high teens? We certainly do and if you go back to our fiscal '15 results, we were at about 13.8 for the year of fiscal '15, but the last three quarters all exceeded 14%. And with the addition of the ZEE business, that certainly is going to benefit us long term and we really like the business. It's doing exactly what we would expect that it should do, and those margins will continue to improve. Operator It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Hansen I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Mike Hansen Well thank you for joining us tonight. We'll issue our fourth quarter earnings in mid-July and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Good night. Operator And that does conclude today's presentation.

If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at:  transcripts@seekingalpha.com . Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead. Hamzah Mazari The first question is just on customer attrition. Are you guys baking in any customer attrition post the G&K deal? Obviously, that's closed now. And any thoughts on the Uniform market potentially getting incrementally more competitive, as you work to integrate that deal? Mike Hansen Well, Hamzah, I would say that the industry is always very competitive and it will continue to be so. As it relates to the customer attrition or retention, I don't know that I expect much of a difference there, but let me speak a little bit towards revenue; our thoughts on revenue in general. So, when we think about the Cintas business as we move forward, we have no expectations for change. We continue to expect growth in that mid-to-high single-digits. When we think about the G&K revenue though, you can think about it in terms of there's a new business component, there is the kind of customer penetration, and there's a lost business or attrition component, in the normal course of doing business. And as we move forward, we're going to continue to have that customer attrition that we've seen in -- that G&K has seen historically, and that we'll likely see continue into the future. There will likely be a little bit of an increase due to disruption of the integration, but generally speaking I would say not a lot of change. The difference though will be the new business component. So as you can kind of think about new business and the G&K sales team over the course of the last seven months, they have been trying to sell in an environment where selling a five-year contract under kind of an uncertain future is, as you could imagine is quite difficult. So the new business component certainly has been pressured quite a bit over the last seven months. As we move into now the post-closing process, that momentum carries into our post-closing process. In addition, as we think about their sales people, you can imagine that the difficulty in selling new business and contractual new business in the environment resulted in some attrition. And so as we move forward, we will need to hire new people to replace some of those sales people, but also train all of their sales people as we move forward. So training them on selling our products and services, training them on our systems, using our processes et cetera and there certainly will be a productivity -- a negative productivity impact. So as we look forward, we will continue to probably see the normal customer attrition that the business has seen, maybe a little bit higher. But we will also see some significant pressures on the new business. And so as we think about that moving forward, our experience has been for years and years that we will see some pressure to the point where we may see revenue come down in the 5% to 10% range over the course of the next year or so. Hamzah Mazari That’s extremely helpful. And just a follow up question. Are there any divestitures build into your cost synergy target number of 130 to 140 or is that something you are working through right now? Mike Hansen There were no divestitures baked into that assumption. Operator Our next question comes from Gary Bissey with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jay Hanna Hi, this is actually Jay Hanna on for Garry today. I was wondering if you guys could give a little more detailed look at what the pace of those cost synergies will be? And maybe a more detailed timeline for the full integration of G&K within Cintas as well? Mike Hansen Well, as you probably have seen, we talked about $130 million to $140 million in annual synergies, fully realized in year four. We have also talked about this being fully accretive or accretive in our second full year. That would be our fiscal '19. As we move forward, we certainly have had a lot of assumptions about those synergies, but I will tell you over the course of the last seven months, one thing that I need to make sure is clear, is we have been operating as two separate companies, and that was a requirement, so that we were not jumping ahead of the regulatory process. And I tell you that because we are just now -- we just closed yesterday. We are just now getting into the confirming of our assumptions, and we need to do that before we can provide more timing, more specific timing on the synergies. But we do feel like we will be accretive in year two, and in year one we are going to have some onetime expenses that are non-recurring in nature; things like rebranding, asset impairments, severance, lease breakage type thing and we're going to be going to work over the course of the next several months, really confirming what those amounts will be. Once we do that, once we confirm our assumptions for the integration plan, we'll have a better idea of what fiscal '18 will look like and our expectation would be we certainly share that in July. But having said all of that, we certainly do think that there will be synergies in year one. We’re just not ready to provide any specific numbers. Jay Hanna Great. And then excluding the acquisition and following in this quarter, you spoke to it a little bit earlier. But do you think full year ’17 guidance, would it remain the same or possibly increase following third quarter? Mike Hansen I would say that we would likely have either left them the same or possibly narrowed by bringing the bottoms up a little bit. So third quarter, we are very pleased with the third quarter. I think we’ve got some nice momentum and execution going on in the business and we are poised to have a good fourth quarter. Operator And we’ll take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Joe Box Yes. Hey guys. So I was hoping to dig into the 80 basis points sequential pick-up in organic growth for Uniform. Looks like there was about 15 basis points sequential tailwind from less oil and gas drag. So can you maybe put a little bit more color on the non-oil and gas improvement, really just aside from calling out ancillary products and better customer retention? Paul Adler Yes. Joe, it’s Paul. You are right, the 15 basis points is part of the math. I would say in addition to that, we had a very good strong quarter from a new business perspective, especially as it related to garments. And so not only do you benefit from the new business in terms of that additional recurring revenue, that you will receive from the garments going forward over these five-year agreements, but we have new business installed related to garments. You also have some good revenue in terms of peripheral charges, incentive fees and emblem costs. So that definitely helped as well. But really outside of that Joe, there was nothing extraordinary. It’s just the continuation of execution that the game plan, quality service, retention remained strong, a very strong organic revenue growth quarter, something we’re proud of, given all the excitement of the pending acquisition. But just continuation of what we’ve done the last six years of growing top-line and that 5% to 7% organically, and again proud of those growth rates compared to the competition, which has been posting much, much smaller organic growth rates. Joe Box I appreciate it Paul. And then just a question on guidance. I guess, I’m just curious, why not provide a non-cash goal post here. So purchase accounting is really kind of the biggest unknown. And then I guess just from an expectation standpoint, should we think about maybe an inter-quarter 8-K with guidance, once you guys get the third-party valuations done or should we be thinking about this as being maybe a more 4Q call type item? Mike Hansen As a relates to why not provide some sort of guidance, whether it’s cash or something else. Joe, we’re going to get busy right away and we’re going to get busy on the integration items. And as we do that, the businesses blur. It’s not like we’re going to go through the next two and slightly over two months and have two distinct businesses still by the end. They are going to get blurred, because we’re bringing them together and we’re going to be doing quite a bit of integration work. And it just -- it becomes very, very difficult to keep those pieces separate. And because of that we're not -- I don’t like the idea of trying to dissect that. If we do come up with the purchase accounting results during the quarter and we feel that we're in a position to provide them, you may see us do that, but our first goal is to really understand it and get it right and then provide. Joe Box Understood, and I do appreciate that the lines will get blurred here, but I assume that the fiscal year 4Q revenue guidance for standalone Cintas probably is still generally intact. Is that fair? Mike Hansen As we've talked about, yes. We think that's fair and it probably -- we would probably have narrowed it by bringing the bottom up. We feel good about the fourth quarter and the third quarter I think is very indicative of the second half of the year that we expected to have. So yes, the answer to your question is yes.  Operator [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Andrew Steinerman Hi, would you be willing to talk how long you think the amortization period will be. And in year one if it wasn't for the amortization, would the merger be accretive? Mike Hansen The amortization period will be 10 years most likely. We expect that to be in the range of about 3% to 4% of the deal value. And would it be accretive without that? I think yes. I think the answer Andrew is yes, that you can kind a think about that as a what, $66 million to $88 million annual number. It will be fairly a large non-cash number.  Operator Our next question comes from Minaz Putnik with Barclays.  Minaz Putnik  Thank you, good evening gentlemen, and firstly congratulations on getting the deal done. So I appreciate -- I think why you I guess retracted the guidance to '17. And just to your point on calling out that amortization as a non-cash number in Q4. Going forward when you guys do initiate '18 guidance, will you be -- if not giving sort of the cash EPS number at least call out all these non-cash charges pretty clearly for us to calculate that? Mike Hansen That will be our goal yes. We will likely provide GAAP guidance but we will -- our goal will be to give you some of these large items to give you a sense of what the performance detail will look like. Minaz Putnik Okay that would be very helpful. And then just on the organic performance, another strong quarter obviously. Just like how you describe the three components for G&K in terms of new business penetration and retention, or attrition, can you just help lay that out in terms of where the growth is coming for Cintas standalone right now? Paul Adler Definitely new businesses continue to be the strongest driver of the growth. As we've said it, new business in terms of new customers; we're still selling that 60/40 split of 60% of the new business wins, our new programmers versus the 40% taking market share. So that's been very consistent through this year and really in the near past as well. New business also includes the penetration of our existing customers. That is certainly part of our vision and that continues at a very good pace. A lot of the hygiene products that we've talked about in the past, our Sanis signature series, new offering in the last couple of years, that's really helped us with penetration. Retention has been roughly 95%. So still strong, no significant change in that. So, really no significant movement in any of the key component of organic growth drivers. Minaz Putnik And that 40% share gain you talked about, does that typically end up being from the smaller regional players or do they -- or is it a broad mix with the national players as well? Mike Hansen No, it's a broad mix of wins versus small, medium, large competitors. Operator Our next question comes from George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Adrian Paz Hi this is Adrian Paz calling for George. I just have question on the G&K transaction. Can you provide -- on the synergies, can you provide the breakdown of what's going to be revenue synergies versus what's going to be synergies? Mike Hansen We have not included any revenue synergies in that $130 million to $140 million. Those are cost synergies and they come in four primary buckets and in no particular order. We think of them in terms of material cost. So, a sourcing benefit. We think of them in terms of production improvements. So, the more efficient use of capacity. We think of them in terms of the route density allowing us to use less fuel because of more dense routes. And then we think about it in terms of overhead and the reduction of duplicate overhead. Did not include any revenue synergies in that amount. And one of the reasons we didn’t is because we need to get through the integration work. We need to get them on to our systems. We need to optimize the routes and we need to have our new G&K partners really trained and comfortable in selling our product line, and that takes a little bit of time. Adrian Paz And on the -- so with the SAP implementation, do you expect your cost savings from the SAP platform to be bigger within the G&K transaction or are your estimates since then? Mike Hansen We do expect the benefit to be bigger. We are -- first of all the additional revenue certainly provides better leverage over the system. But certainly, operating on one system in total certainly will create additional benefits for us. And the better visibility into all of our new customers will certainly help us in terms of identifying cross seller penetration opportunities, identifying where certain industries we are -- customers in certain industries where we believe we have got a good product mix to provide value, but certain customers in that industry don’t have some of those. We think there is a lot of opportunity, and certainly by adding the G&K volume, that certainly helps it out. Paul Adler And to add to that. More benefits and then really not a lot of significant additional costs; that's the beauty of the acquisition. Just another positive is that we get to leverage G&K over that existing $140 million spend. So, we'll have some have additional licensing costs, nominal amount but the capital investment is not going to increase. Adrian Paz And if I could just ask one more, on the non-programming market or the no-programmer market, how do you think about that market and how much growth you believe is available there and do those declines have the margin profile as your existing clients? Mike Hansen We think there is a lot of runway there. As Paul said about two thirds of our new business comes from that no-programmer segment, and it's been that way for a long time. The -- we have talked a little bit about what that no-programmer may look like. It could be outdoor trades, people that are now renting our Carhartt products. It could be culinary people now renting our Chef Works product, it could be healthcare workers now renting our scrub rental programs. There are lots of opportunities there and there will continue to be. The margin profile is I would say is not significantly different from any other type of account, but certainly we know that with all of our customers the more penetration that we can take -- that we can have, the product and services that we can add to them, the more valuable those stocks become. Usually the lesser the probability that they leave us because we are more fully penetrated. So once we sell any account, penetration becomes really important afterwards. Operator And our next question comes from Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Justin Hauke I just wanted to talk a little bit more about maybe how does think about revenue synergies, and I guess the reason why I ask is obviously you guys have been very successful in broadening out services that you offered. You are acquiring 170,000 customers here. Is there a difference, and maybe you can give us the number of average services you sell to your current customers and how that compared to G&K; so we can kind of think about what the incremental opportunity to sell into that base is? And I guess related to that also would be, is there any material difference in the 95% retention rate that you have and the retention rate that maybe you are acquiring here? Mike Hansen I would -- so first of all, I don’t know the penetration of G&K. Again, we haven’t had visibility and insight until really starting today, and we’ll start to learn that more and more. So it’s hard for me to try to estimate what any revenue penetration might be. We have told -- we have talked a lot about, if you think about our Uniform Rental customers for example, the highest penetrated item is our mats, entrance mats. And I would say about 60% of our Uniform Rental customers have entrance mats. That doesn’t mean they have as many as we believe that they should we have, but it means they have at least some presence in the entrance mat. In addition to that, all of our other products are less than 20% penetrated. So we have a lot of runway on our own and I would suspect that G&K’s profile is from a Uniform Rental and match, is probably not a lot different than ours, although that is purely a guess. And I would say that the broader line for us likely in the hygiene and the chemical cleaning First Aid and Safety Fire Protection, those become nice opportunities. I don’t have any kind of information as far as qualifying that, because we just don’t know enough about those customers. And an example would be, I want to see, or we would want to see the profile of the G&K customers. And that’s when we start to analyze or look for the opportunities in terms of what are the products and services we can provide to that. So we need some time to be able to do that. As it relates to your second question of retention, again don’t have specifics on that, but I would say that they are probably not two different from ours. Although, I would suggest that because our growth rate is so much higher than the industry in general, that our retention is likely a little bit better. Justin Hauke Okay, great. No, I understand it’s still early. So that’s fair, and we’ll look forward to learning more about it, as you learn more about it. I guess just two more mechanical questions into modeling purposes. First, are you planning on reporting all of G&K in the rental segment or should we think that some of it goes in the other business? And how much of it would go there? And then second, the SAP cost that you previously outlined, the 40 million to 45 million for 2018, how should we think about that number, now that you’re bringing in G&K? Is that still the right number or does it have to be larger than that? Mike Hansen So your first question is, yes. I would say almost all of that revenue and operating income would fall into the rental segment. As it relates to the second question, we will give some thoughts on SAP, when we provide our guidance in July. But I would suggest that it’s going to be lower than 40 to 45 for -- probably because, we’ve seen that we’ve been a little bit more efficient this year than we expected. And the additional -- any additional costs related to an integration of G&K will come in the way of length and integration or implementation process. So I wouldn't expect that it drives up our costs in fiscal '18. I would just -- I think we talked a little bit about it drives the implementation process into fiscal '19. So we'll see a little bit of -- a little bit more expense in '19 than we initially expected, because of the duration with G&K. But again, the process has been going well and we've been spending less than we expected, and I would expect that results in lower numbers for '18.  Operator [Operator Instructions].

Ctrip does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement except as required under applicable law. James, Jane, and Cindy will share our strategy and the business updates, operating highlights and financial performance for the first quarter as well as the outlook for the second quarter of 2017. After the prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. With that, I will turn the call over to James for our business update. James, please? James Jianzhang Liang - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Thank you, Cecilia (01:57), and thanks to everyone for joining us today on the call. We kicked off 2017 with great results. Net revenues were up 46% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by solid organic growth and the inclusion of Skyscanner. Non-GAAP operating margin was 15% for the quarter improving significantly from 0% in the same period a year ago. In the following discussion, I would like to share some update on Ctrip's progress, expanding into lower tier cities and international markets. The blooming travel market in lower tier cities continues to offer growth opportunities for Ctrip. A recent survey conducted by China Central Television shows that travel has been ranked number one in Chinese consumers' personal spending list for three consecutive years. In addition, the travel demand in the second and third tier cities is catching up quickly, with close to half of the local customers showing interest in travel in 2017. We're excited about this trend and have made great strides in solidifying our leadership in gaining more market share in China, especially in lower tier cities. Ctrip is dedicated to provide the most comprehensive product offerings with competitive pricing in targeted lower tier cities. Along with advertising, we have also run promotions and campaigns across business segments to raise brand awareness in these good markets. These efforts have effectively stimulated local travel demand. The number of room nights booked in the most recent quarter – in the most popular lower tier cities, our average grew 100% year-over-year during the Labor Day holiday. Next, I would like to comment on our international business development. Ctrip's outbound travel business has maintained a strong growth momentum in 2017, and our international expansion is further enhanced by the Skyscanner investment. We are working closely with the company to develop its direct booking capacity for air ticketing in the future. Skyscanner will collaborate more closely with its business partners by allowing them to operate storefronts on its platform. The new approach will bring a seamless booking experience. The results of the early entry – early trials have been encouraging. Skyscanner has seen strong uplift in conversion rates, ancillary upsell and mobile bookings for all the partners. The direct booking facility will be fully available in the second half of the year. Ctrip will leverage Skyscanner platform to better serve travelers around the world. In order to provide the talent to support our international expansion, Ctrip announced the establishment of international talent center in April. We will both develop the young leaders internally and recruit candidates overseas. Ctrip has been making solid improvement over the past 17 years. We are confident that we'll continue along the path and achieve great success in both domestic and international travel markets in the future. With that, I will turn the call over to Jane for business highlights. Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Thanks, James. Hello, everyone. I'm pleased to update you with the development of Ctrip's main business lines. First, hotel and other accommodations, total hotel revenue grew by 28% compared to the same period last year, driven by volume growth. This quarter's growth rate reflected a negative impact of approximately 5% to 10% due to the adoption of the VAT tax. At the end of the first quarter, Ctrip's domestic hotel coverage reached 540,000 hotels increasing by almost 30% over a year ago. The investments we made in penetrating into the second tier and third tier cities have started to bear fruits. Qunar's hotel revenue in the third and fourth tier cities increased around 90% year-over-year in the first quarter. Ctrip never stops innovating. The accommodation team recently introduced the Easy Stay strategy and launched several new products and services, including online room selection, invoice preordering, and automated check-in and check-out machines, et cetera. These initiatives have incorporated Ctrip's advanced IT technology and would further differentiate us from other players in the market. Second, transportation ticketing services. Total transportation revenue grew by 48% year-over-year in the fourth quarter benefiting from the fast-growing new business units and inclusions of Skyscanner. Air ticketing delivered a solid growth. We have continued to optimize our best-in-the-class services. Recently, we opened a new service center in Weihai, devoted to automated customer support in air ticketing. It improves service efficiency and increase convenience for our customers. Also, a recent survey showed the ancillary service provided by the platform have been well received by our customers. Over 50% of the travelers, who bought VIP products, expressed their interest in a repeat purchase. Ground transportation, including train ticketing, bus ticketing and car rental, achieved over 100% revenue growth year-over-year in the first quarter. These businesses have also been accelerating their international expansion. Train ticketing and bus ticketing have both extended their coverage outside of Mainland China. Our international car rental businesses have partnered with over 500 suppliers worldwide and achieved approximately 300% year-over-year growth in the first quarter. In addition, we have continued to strengthen our multi-model transportation offerings. In April, we added the bus plus train products to our platforms, which help transport our customers to lower tier cities in the countries where the final leg of their journey are not covered by train. Third, packaged tours. Packaged tour revenue increased steadily, up 26% year-over-year due to the healthy volume growth. Together with Travel (sic) [Traveling] Bestone, Ctrip pioneered the new retail model in the travel space, which seamlessly integrated online products with offline services. Travel (sic) [Traveling] Bestone has over 5,500 offline franchise stores in 23 provinces and municipalities across China, the majority of which are in the second tier and third tier cities. These stores are generating healthy profits. We plan to open 1,000 more offline franchise stores nationwide, where customers can enjoy one-on-one services from professional consultants and access over 700,000 products from more than 20,000 travel agencies around the world. In 2017, our packaged tour team will invest further in procurement, distribution, product development and service innovation. By working together with our partners, we will focus on improving industry efficiency, expanding our customer base, enhancing product sourcing and delivering high quality offerings. Fourth, corporate travel. The corporate travel business delivered a solid year-over-year growth of 25%. The corporate travel market in China continues to grow rapidly. According to a recent report established by Global Business Travel Association, China will replace the USA to become the largest corporate travel market in 2017. Ctrip is well-positioned to benefit from this favorable secular trend. Our corporate travel team is dedicated to strengthening our competitiveness of our platform and open to collaborating with all parties involved to create more value for our corporate customers. In March, the team announced a cooperative agreement with China Eastern Airlines for a deepened collaboration in client service and product sharing. The two parties will also explore new opportunities to optimize and upgrade corporate travel services in the future. The year of 2017 is shaping up to become another remarkable year. The group will continue to work hard to penetrate into the lower tier cities and expand internationally with our customers. These endeavors will further widen our competitive modes and strengthen our leadership in China travel industry. As always, we would like to thank our customers, business partners, employees and shareholders for their continued support. We will work hard and deliver great results in the years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Cindy for financial highlights. Cindy Xiaofan Wang - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Thank you, Jane. Thank you, everyone.

Question-and-Answer Session Operator Your first question is from the line of Amanda Chen. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Amanda Chen - Morgan Stanley Asia Ltd. Hi, management, thank you for taking my questions. My question is regarding the international market. The first one is, I think James you mentioned that – you shared some updates on the international expansion, especially with development of Skyscanner. I'm wondering could you share some updates in other areas such as the development of Ctrip's organic outbound travel business and the cooperation with MakeMyTrip and Priceline, et cetera. And then the second question is we noticed that you have a lot of cash sitting on the balance sheet. I think the stock performance is quite good as well. And if I read the number correctly, I think you borrowed around like RMB 4 billion short-term loan for the quarter. So, shall we expect more international M&A to come in near term, and if so, what kind of company that Ctrip might prefer, it's a company with more online traffic and content or it's a company with more offline resources? Thank you. James Jianzhang Liang - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Yeah. International market will be a huge opportunity for growth for years to come. Our strategy first is to develop more complete product offering. China will be the largest travel market in the world, and our scale advantage will give us advantage in providing product services to non-Chinese customers, especially in East Asia who typically travel to similar destinations as Chinese. Second, we'll work closely with partners to offer one-stop travel service globally, for example Skyscanner. And also, for example, we will continue to work very closely with Priceline to offer hotel products throughout the world, especially in non-Asia region. And lastly, we'll invest heavily in technology and innovation. And we are open to investing and partnering with technology and travel product leaders in the world. Our goal is to become most successful travel brand – one of the most successful travel brands in Asia and one of the most successful travel companies in the world. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Keung. Please proceed. Ronald Keung - Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC Thank you. Thank you, James, Jane, Cindy and Cecilia (24:38). Very strong set of results. Can you just give us some of the 2Q guidance and outlook on your revenue growth expectation by segment? We see very strong gross margins. Do you think this is sustainable? And usually seasonality-wise, should we expect gross margins to maintain such strength? Also the two cost items on sales and marketing that has declined quite a bit and the share-based compensation has fallen quite a bit and sales and marketing has gone up quite a bit. Can you just give us some expectations into the next few quarters? Thank you. Cindy Xiaofan Wang - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Sure. Thank you. So our net revenue will grow at a similar pace moving toward the second quarter of this year. Our net revenue will grow 40% to 45% year-over-year. With respect to the each business line items, please note that there is – the following guidance actually included 5% to 10% negative VAT tax impacted. So for the accommodation reservation business, we expect to have a 25% to 35% year-on-year revenue growth. And for the transportation ticketing business, we expect to have 40% to 50% year-over-year growth and packaged tour to have 20% to 30%, and corporate travel will maintain a very solid growth at around 15% to 25% year-over-year growth. And Ctrip will continue to be very disciplined on the cost side and expected to deliver RMB 900 million to RMB 1 billion in the non-GAAP operating profit. You already see we achieved savings in efficiency improvement in almost all expenses line items. And the reason why share-based compensation dropped significantly is because, in the first quarter last year, Ctrip Group has a one-time share-based incentive plan. That is the impact. And for the sales and marketing expenses, yes, we always closely monitor each sales and marketing channels in terms of the ROI. Once the ROI is positive, we will continuously to make investment. But moving into this year, as James and Jane both said, we will very decisively to make investment in the second and third tier cities because we see huge potentials in those comparatively lower market. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly. Please proceed. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Great. Good morning, management. Thank you for taking my question. Just touching around, I guess, on the expansion into the lower tier cities, can you talk about the ROI trends you're seeing in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities as you aggressively expand? And are you seeing any positive ROI in those cities? Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Sure. Thanks, Jed. Our approach has always been to start our business with the most profitable segment. So Ctrip in the past had been very successful, starting our business in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and the coastal area where the buying power is very strong. So Ctrip platform probably accumulates the most affluent customers on our platform. Now, going forward, the second tier, third tier cities, the GDP per capita is also growing. So we will decisively invest in these areas. All these cities represents new markets and new opportunities for us. And our strategy are twofold. First of all, we will extend our product offering into these cities, not only in hotels, but also in train tickets, bus tickets, ferry, rental car, et cetera. So our belief is if we provide these comprehensive products for these lower tier cities, it will be a very powerful product offering for the customers that will grow into our platform. Secondly, for these cities, we have not had invest heavily in our branding in the past. Now, our sales and marketing team are penetrating further into these cities and the results have been very promising. The year-over-year growth in these cities has been three-digits. So for these new areas, which represents a new market for us, we will aggressively make our investment. And our guidance has already reflected these investments. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Natalie Wu. Please proceed. Natalie Wu Wu - CICC Hi, management. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick questions here. The first one is about the growth of accommodation service. It seems to be accelerated if we compared to the guidance you gave us for the first quarter three months ago versus the second quarter you just mentioned. So just wondering what is the reason behind. And, secondly, about the recent CCA issue, so just wondering will it have any kind of impact on the take rate of your airline ticketing business. Thank you. Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Yes. So, for the first question, because of our investment, as James said, in the second lower tier cities, we see very promising growth in the lower tier cities in the hotel bookings. That's one of the reasons why you see kind of acceleration of our growth in those, especially in the lower tier markets. And your second question is regarding the air tickets, right? Is the take rate of the air ticket...? Natalie Wu Wu - CICC Yes. The impact from the CCA. Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Yeah. Yes. So, firstly, Ctrip uses cross-selling practice to facilitate one-stop travel experiences. And we basically personalized all the cross-selling options that had to fit customers' requirement based on their historical review and booking history. And that's why we see very positive feedback from our customers and we will continuously improve the conversion rate as well as the customer satisfaction rate. Lastly, but most importantly, customer actually can uncheck any extra services and review their shortlist before or after they check out. So as always, we will continue to work hard to provide the better value to our customers, and as long as we continue to reach customers with the best services to make their travel easier and Ctrip remains the most efficient and effective channel for all our suppliers, we will be able to keep a reasonable return based on our value proposition. Thank you. Natalie Wu Wu - CICC Thanks. Just to... Operator Your next question comes from the line of Wong Binnie. Please proceed. Binnie Wong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Good morning, James, Jane and Cindy. Congratulation on kicking off 2017 with a very solid quarter. Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Thank you. Binnie Wong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch So I have two questions here. First question – yeah, thank you. First question is on the operating margin improvement between your core business and your international revenue basically from Skyscanner this quarter. So, what is Skyscanner revenue contribution in this quarter? I want to understand the margin profile, so we can better understand what is it – how much is that improving in our China core business as well. So if you can share with us the revenue contribution for Skyscanner and also its margin profile, that would be very helpful. And second is that – a follow-on on Skyscanner is that, how is the implementation of the closed loop system is progressing? And then a follow-up on the cross-selling activities is that besides the changes we have already seen in your booking platform, right, and what is – is it already done or any other potential changes we plan to address the announcement by the China Consumer Association. And if we think about, say, some of these ancillary services on the air ticketing are unchecked by default now, how have you seen the conversion rate has changed it? And I guess if you can share with us more color on those, that would be very helpful. Thank you. Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Yeah. Thank you, Binnie. Our operating margin has been significantly improved because I think most important reason is because our very successful synergies we achieved on all the invested companies including Ctrip and Qunar brand. In terms of Skyscanner, their total revenue – their revenue contribution to Ctrip Group is about mid to high-single digit, and their margin profile actually is pretty consistent with Ctrip's Chinese business. So regarding the airline cross-selling, as I said, basically Ctrip is always very cautious about customers' satisfaction and the conversion rate. So we keep monitoring the conversion rate as well as the customer satisfaction rate and all the customers' user behavior. What we observed is that our conversion rate and customer satisfaction rate actually continuously to improve. So, as always, we will continue to work very hard to provide the best product products and best most appropriate cross-selling product to our customers. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alvin Jiang. Please proceed. Unknown Speaker Hi, management. This is Maria (36:19) on behalf of Alvin Jiang. So we have two questions here. So, the first one is, can management share the number of head count currently and what is the number of target for the full year? Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. The head count of Ctrip as a group is about 30,000, and we don't expect to add any material head count increase because of the internationalization strategy, so we will continuously very actively recruit people with international experiences, and as well as for the IT persons, we will continuously very aggressively recruit more talent in those two areas. But overall, we don't expect any material head count increase. Operator Your next question come from the line of Chi Tsang. Please proceed. Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I had a couple of questions in terms of your margins. We've seen a very nice pickup in your gross margins this quarter. I was wondering if you can sort of walk us through the drivers of that and sort of can we squeeze out more efficiencies on the gross margin side. And then secondly, if you can reiterate for us sort of your medium to long-term operating margin targets and sort of what markets are we going to see the most leverage from, is it from SG&A – I mean is it from sales and marketing or G&A or other areas? Thanks so much. Cindy Xiaofan Wang - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Yeah. So, for the gross margin, I think the most important reason is because in the last couple of years, we invested heavily in the IT technologies to automize all the service – backend service offerings. From a customers' perspective, actually if you use Ctrip, maybe you don't feel any difference between if a customer pick up your phone or we use like a machine to answer your basic questions. And to some extent actually, we closely monitor, for example, the NPS, the customer satisfaction ratios. Those ratio continuously to improve. So this is one of the reasons we kind of bear the fruit from the investment we made in the last couple of years. And the second, the minor reason is because Skyscanner's business model, they have the metasearch model. So their gross margin – they bring us about 1% to 1.5% increase in the gross margin. Yeah, as always, we will continuously improve our operational efficiency across all the business lines going forward, but I think the 80% gross margin has already reflected the very scalable business and efficient business models we have. So we believe the 80% would be pretty consistent at least in the next couple of quarters. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Justin Patterson. Please proceed. Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thank you very much management. And congratulations on another strong quarter. Two if I may. First on the MakeMyTrip capital raise you participated in recently. Could you talk about just what you've learned from being an investor in MakeMyTrip about penetrating the India market? And then secondly on Skyscanner, you mentioned some of your efforts to improve conversion on that platform. Could you discuss how quickly that's rolling along, how quickly you expect that to reach what you were able to achieve with Qunar? Thank you. Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Sure. For MakeMyTrip, we believe the Indian market is at the stage where China was 10 to 20 years ago. And the population is the second largest, upcoming to take over as the largest population in the whole world. That is why we are very positive in the market, although it might take some time. So the investment we made in MakeMyTrip is very helpful in terms of knowledge sharing and experience sharing because the two markets have experienced intense competition, and there are lot of things that we can share together. So we work very closely with the team by sharing our knowledge, our product, our past experience with them. And MakeMyTrip is the dominant – is the largest OTA in Indian market, and we are positive in the future, they will grow very well into this faster growing market. The second question is Skyscanner. Skyscanner and Ctrip are working very closely on the IT front to make the direct booking accessible for Skyscanner's team, and our original plan is by the end of the year, the first booking will be pushed through, but our both IT team worked very hard. So the first booking was pushed through a few weeks ago, much earlier than we expected. So we're very positive in moving forward to improve the service and users' experience on Skyscanner by providing the direct booking onto their sites. So it's moving much smoother and also faster than we originally planned. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap. Please proceed. Alicia Yap - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd. Hi, good morning, James, Jane and Cindy. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a follow-up question on the margin. I think Cindy you mentioned earlier that Skyscanner margins is consistent with the Ctrip China margins. So I just wonder if the Ctrip China margins is lower than the group reported margins, so actually excluding Skyscanner this quarter, the reported margin would have been higher, right? So, just wanted to get that sense. And then second is overall on your margins outlook, given your continued effort to expand into the global branding and also the lower tier cities, just wonder what would be the sales and marketing lines to be and then, well, Skyscanner also have the marketing spend as well to also impact the margins. Thank you. Cindy Xiaofan Wang - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Yeah. Ctrip, as always – we always continue to – first priority given we're still in the very early stage of our development with huge potentials both domestically and internationally. So we are in the very early stage. Our top priority is still to continuously gaining market share, firstly, in the lower tier city of China and secondly in the international market. And so, overall speaking, even with this top priority, given we already have the dominant position especially in the China market, we are very confident that our margin will go back to the non-GAAP 20% to 30% level in the next one to two years. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jia Long Shi. Please proceed. Jia Long Shi - Nomura International (Hong Kong) Ltd. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And I have two follow-ups. And for the CCA investigation, I think, Cindy, you mentioned earlier based on your observation the conversion rate actually has continued to improve. So I just wonder did you mean the conversion rate for the cross-selling service actually continued to improve even after you have made some adjustments recently to your practice of cross-selling in response to CCA investigation. For the Skyscanner, I understand you're trying to transform Skyscanner from a traffic generation model to direct booking model, which is similar to your own air ticketing service. I just wonder when you talk to those overseas airlines, what are their feedback to such a change in Skyscanner's service model? Are they cooperative in terms of allowing their passengers to complete the air ticketing booking within Skyscanner's website instead of those airlines' website? Thank you. Cindy Xiaofan Wang - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Yes. We – actually our air ticketing team there working very hard to find the most appropriate and useful product to cross-selling together with the air ticket. For example, the VIP Lounge service is over 50% of the customers, they choose once – select – will add them to the next shopping, which tells you how important and useful those cross-selling product is. And also, we believe Ctrip has – in the last couple years, we invested heavily in terms of both the pricing as well as the comprehensiveness of our international air ticket. So overall speaking, we believe as long as we can meet or even to some extent always provide the product that to some extent even exceed some of the customers' expectation, Ctrip has the value proposition to make profit at the most efficient distribution in the air distribution industry. And regarding Skyscanner, yes, actually Skyscanner, they provide marketplaces that offers carriers very strong branding controls through their storefronts whereby carriers can actually easily display their full range of products. And at the same time, travelers will also enjoy a more similar experience of selecting from a variety of air ticket choices, for example, the price choices or the seat selections, while they're interacting with the airline (48:18) during their bookings after they introduced direct booking. So we believe we already see a very positive – or the direct booking engines are very well received by all the airlines. Operator Again, ladies and gentlemen for questions, we're taking questions from analysts and you may ask one question per queue. If you have an additional question, you may queue back up for questions. Our next question comes from the line of Ming Xu. Please proceed. Ming Xu - UBS Securities (Asia) Ltd. Thanks, management, for taking my question and congratulation on strong quarter. Also some questions on take rate. So first of all, can you share with us the current take rate on the hotel side for Ctrip and for Qunar separately? And then given your market share in China and also the – we noticed that hotels operations are also improving recently. Is there any plan or potential for you to further raise the take rate on the hotel side? And we also noticed that you have launched several schemes such as step-up commission rate structure and also the prepaid hotel products. Are these products going to help you to actually raise your take rate on the hotel side? And finally (49:47 – 49:52). Cindy Xiaofan Wang - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Thank you. So our hotel take rate has been pretty consistent. Before couponing, our growth take rate on the hotel is about 10% to 15%. But we still keep a certain level of the couponing, especially in the lower tier – in the lower end of the market to make sure that we have the most competitive pricing in those markets. So the net take rate is about 8% to 10% on the hotel side. If you then – yes, definitely, there is room for us to further increase our net take rate on the hotel side. But given that for the hotel business both domestically and internationally, we are still in the very, very early stage. We have only single-digit of the total market share in the hotel segment. Our top priority is to further expand our market share both domestically as well as the international hotel markets. So we don't have the plan to increase significantly on the take rate. Rather we will grow our business mainly driven by the very healthy volume growth on the hotel side. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Juan Lin. Please proceed. Juan Lin - 86Research Ltd. Hi. Good morning, James, Jane and Cindy. Congratulations on another strong quarter. I have a follow-up question on gross margin. Could you help us to rank the gross margins of your different business lines? In particular, could you share with us the margin trend for your accommodation booking business, as you continue to penetrate into low tier cities? And also a quickly follow-up on the OPAC, your plan is opening 1,000 more franchise stores, whether you are going to leverage the retail stores of Bestone or are these all brand new stores and how will the plan impact the outlook of OPAC? Thank you. Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Yeah. These stores are franchise stores, so within one year, they will be profitable, so the strategic value for them to bring us is coupled with our penetration into the lower tier cities. We want to make sure it's a full product offering, penetrating strongly into the lower tier cities. So we're not only offering air tickets and hotels, the two main products, we are also offering packaged tour, train, bus, ferry, rental car, et cetera. With this comprehensive product offering, we'll be able to attract more customers from the lower tier cities. So the Bestone store in these cities will become a really valuable penetration method in terms of have the first-hand contact with our targeted customers. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tian Hou. Please proceed. Tian X. Hou - T. H. Capital LLC Morning, management. Couple of questions. The first one is regarding the transportation. It's grown really rapidly. I would like to gain some details about the contributions from different parts of the transportation in both revenue and volume. What's the contribution from the train, from the bus, from the air in the revenue and volume? So, that is the question one. The number two question... Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Within the transportation, the reason you see very healthy or rapid growth is firstly because our small business units including the train ticket, bus ticket and car services, all those small business lines they grow pretty significantly triple-digit growth. And in terms of the volumes, the train ticket already surpassed the air ticket to become the largest contributor in the transportation ticketing in terms of volumes. In terms of a revenue, train, bus as well as rental car services total contributed about 15% to 20% of our total transportation revenues, and the other reason is our addition of Skyscanner business. As you may know, Skyscanner, vast majority of their revenues coming from the air ticket. So, that's also the reason the transportation ticket has much higher growth rate than other business lines. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alex Yao. Please proceed. Alex Yao - JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. First question is a follow-up on gross margin. So if I understand correctly, the reason for gross margin improvement this quarter are two-folds. One is that you used more machine to replace labor services in the call center, which reduced fixed cost and then second reason is because the Skyscanner cost structure difference. So I think these two reasons are both structural and that the gross margin should be at least flattish at this level, but once we factor in the seasonality, that basically suggests that your gross margin will continue to improve in the next few quarters. Is this a correct statement? Secondly, I want to hear your thoughts on the lower tier investment strategy. Can you talk about, from product offering, competitive landscape and the return on investment perspective? How do lower tier city differs to the high tier city? Thank you. Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Sure. Thanks, Alex. First of all, on the margin, because we pushed very hard to improve IT system, the automation, robotic technology has taken off in our platform. We do have the ability to increase our scalability without adding more people. So the scale is there. So you are right. If we look at our existing portfolio, the margin improvements will be very much anticipated. However, as a fast-growing company, we always want to innovate and penetrate into the new market. So we will reserve sufficient funds and the resources to penetrate into the untouched market, and the second tier and third tier cities are our target this year. So we will use the savings on certain area and use these resources to help us to expand into the new markets in the second tier and third tier cities. And your question on investment in new product and ROI, again we normally start with the most significant products and most significant and profitable markets. So the first tier cities, Ctrip has very strong branding in these areas. And second tier cities and coastal areas are also very profitable. So we have strong hold in these profitable markets. And then we are looking to the new markets. And so we penetrate further into the third tier and fourth tier cities. These cities are relatively green and also GDP per capita is not reaching our target yet. However, by taking these new markets and offering comprehensive products into these area along with our sales and marketing expansion, we will be able to educate these new customers and grow them into our portfolio going forward, and they will become our new customers. So the initial investment of the ROI will be lower than the matured market, but for us, these are the new markets. We're not targeting to make too much money from them, but our target is aggressively gain market share. And our improved margins will enable us not only to penetrate into these lower tier cities, but also show a healthy expansion into the market. So our goal are three things. First of all, aggressive top line growth; second, expansion and healthy margin; third, aggressive investment into the new market. So we will be able to achieve these three goals simultaneously through the hard work from our IT team as well as our service and product teams.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator Your first question is from the line of Amanda Chen. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Amanda Chen - Morgan Stanley Asia Ltd. Hi, management, thank you for taking my questions. My question is regarding the international market. The first one is, I think James you mentioned that – you shared some updates on the international expansion, especially with development of Skyscanner. I'm wondering could you share some updates in other areas such as the development of Ctrip's organic outbound travel business and the cooperation with MakeMyTrip and Priceline, et cetera. And then the second question is we noticed that you have a lot of cash sitting on the balance sheet. I think the stock performance is quite good as well. And if I read the number correctly, I think you borrowed around like RMB 4 billion short-term loan for the quarter. So, shall we expect more international M&A to come in near term, and if so, what kind of company that Ctrip might prefer, it's a company with more online traffic and content or it's a company with more offline resources? Thank you. James Jianzhang Liang - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Yeah. International market will be a huge opportunity for growth for years to come. Our strategy first is to develop more complete product offering. China will be the largest travel market in the world, and our scale advantage will give us advantage in providing product services to non-Chinese customers, especially in East Asia who typically travel to similar destinations as Chinese. Second, we'll work closely with partners to offer one-stop travel service globally, for example Skyscanner. And also, for example, we will continue to work very closely with Priceline to offer hotel products throughout the world, especially in non-Asia region. And lastly, we'll invest heavily in technology and innovation. And we are open to investing and partnering with technology and travel product leaders in the world. Our goal is to become most successful travel brand – one of the most successful travel brands in Asia and one of the most successful travel companies in the world. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Keung. Please proceed. Ronald Keung - Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC Thank you. Thank you, James, Jane, Cindy and Cecilia (24:38). Very strong set of results. Can you just give us some of the 2Q guidance and outlook on your revenue growth expectation by segment? We see very strong gross margins. Do you think this is sustainable? And usually seasonality-wise, should we expect gross margins to maintain such strength? Also the two cost items on sales and marketing that has declined quite a bit and the share-based compensation has fallen quite a bit and sales and marketing has gone up quite a bit. Can you just give us some expectations into the next few quarters? Thank you. Cindy Xiaofan Wang - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Sure. Thank you. So our net revenue will grow at a similar pace moving toward the second quarter of this year. Our net revenue will grow 40% to 45% year-over-year. With respect to the each business line items, please note that there is – the following guidance actually included 5% to 10% negative VAT tax impacted. So for the accommodation reservation business, we expect to have a 25% to 35% year-on-year revenue growth. And for the transportation ticketing business, we expect to have 40% to 50% year-over-year growth and packaged tour to have 20% to 30%, and corporate travel will maintain a very solid growth at around 15% to 25% year-over-year growth. And Ctrip will continue to be very disciplined on the cost side and expected to deliver RMB 900 million to RMB 1 billion in the non-GAAP operating profit. You already see we achieved savings in efficiency improvement in almost all expenses line items. And the reason why share-based compensation dropped significantly is because, in the first quarter last year, Ctrip Group has a one-time share-based incentive plan. That is the impact. And for the sales and marketing expenses, yes, we always closely monitor each sales and marketing channels in terms of the ROI. Once the ROI is positive, we will continuously to make investment. But moving into this year, as James and Jane both said, we will very decisively to make investment in the second and third tier cities because we see huge potentials in those comparatively lower market. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly. Please proceed. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Great. Good morning, management. Thank you for taking my question. Just touching around, I guess, on the expansion into the lower tier cities, can you talk about the ROI trends you're seeing in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities as you aggressively expand? And are you seeing any positive ROI in those cities? Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Sure. Thanks, Jed. Our approach has always been to start our business with the most profitable segment. So Ctrip in the past had been very successful, starting our business in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and the coastal area where the buying power is very strong. So Ctrip platform probably accumulates the most affluent customers on our platform. Now, going forward, the second tier, third tier cities, the GDP per capita is also growing. So we will decisively invest in these areas. All these cities represents new markets and new opportunities for us. And our strategy are twofold. First of all, we will extend our product offering into these cities, not only in hotels, but also in train tickets, bus tickets, ferry, rental car, et cetera. So our belief is if we provide these comprehensive products for these lower tier cities, it will be a very powerful product offering for the customers that will grow into our platform. Secondly, for these cities, we have not had invest heavily in our branding in the past. Now, our sales and marketing team are penetrating further into these cities and the results have been very promising. The year-over-year growth in these cities has been three-digits. So for these new areas, which represents a new market for us, we will aggressively make our investment. And our guidance has already reflected these investments. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Natalie Wu. Please proceed. Natalie Wu Wu - CICC Hi, management. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick questions here. The first one is about the growth of accommodation service. It seems to be accelerated if we compared to the guidance you gave us for the first quarter three months ago versus the second quarter you just mentioned. So just wondering what is the reason behind. And, secondly, about the recent CCA issue, so just wondering will it have any kind of impact on the take rate of your airline ticketing business. Thank you. Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Yes. So, for the first question, because of our investment, as James said, in the second lower tier cities, we see very promising growth in the lower tier cities in the hotel bookings. That's one of the reasons why you see kind of acceleration of our growth in those, especially in the lower tier markets. And your second question is regarding the air tickets, right? Is the take rate of the air ticket...? Natalie Wu Wu - CICC Yes. The impact from the CCA. Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Yeah. Yes. So, firstly, Ctrip uses cross-selling practice to facilitate one-stop travel experiences. And we basically personalized all the cross-selling options that had to fit customers' requirement based on their historical review and booking history. And that's why we see very positive feedback from our customers and we will continuously improve the conversion rate as well as the customer satisfaction rate. Lastly, but most importantly, customer actually can uncheck any extra services and review their shortlist before or after they check out. So as always, we will continue to work hard to provide the better value to our customers, and as long as we continue to reach customers with the best services to make their travel easier and Ctrip remains the most efficient and effective channel for all our suppliers, we will be able to keep a reasonable return based on our value proposition. Thank you. Natalie Wu Wu - CICC Thanks. Just to... Operator Your next question comes from the line of Wong Binnie. Please proceed. Binnie Wong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Good morning, James, Jane and Cindy. Congratulation on kicking off 2017 with a very solid quarter. Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Thank you. Binnie Wong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch So I have two questions here. First question – yeah, thank you. First question is on the operating margin improvement between your core business and your international revenue basically from Skyscanner this quarter. So, what is Skyscanner revenue contribution in this quarter? I want to understand the margin profile, so we can better understand what is it – how much is that improving in our China core business as well. So if you can share with us the revenue contribution for Skyscanner and also its margin profile, that would be very helpful. And second is that – a follow-on on Skyscanner is that, how is the implementation of the closed loop system is progressing? And then a follow-up on the cross-selling activities is that besides the changes we have already seen in your booking platform, right, and what is – is it already done or any other potential changes we plan to address the announcement by the China Consumer Association. And if we think about, say, some of these ancillary services on the air ticketing are unchecked by default now, how have you seen the conversion rate has changed it? And I guess if you can share with us more color on those, that would be very helpful. Thank you. Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Yeah. Thank you, Binnie. Our operating margin has been significantly improved because I think most important reason is because our very successful synergies we achieved on all the invested companies including Ctrip and Qunar brand. In terms of Skyscanner, their total revenue – their revenue contribution to Ctrip Group is about mid to high-single digit, and their margin profile actually is pretty consistent with Ctrip's Chinese business. So regarding the airline cross-selling, as I said, basically Ctrip is always very cautious about customers' satisfaction and the conversion rate. So we keep monitoring the conversion rate as well as the customer satisfaction rate and all the customers' user behavior. What we observed is that our conversion rate and customer satisfaction rate actually continuously to improve. So, as always, we will continue to work very hard to provide the best product products and best most appropriate cross-selling product to our customers. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alvin Jiang. Please proceed. Unknown Speaker Hi, management. This is Maria (36:19) on behalf of Alvin Jiang. So we have two questions here. So, the first one is, can management share the number of head count currently and what is the number of target for the full year? Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. The head count of Ctrip as a group is about 30,000, and we don't expect to add any material head count increase because of the internationalization strategy, so we will continuously very actively recruit people with international experiences, and as well as for the IT persons, we will continuously very aggressively recruit more talent in those two areas. But overall, we don't expect any material head count increase. Operator Your next question come from the line of Chi Tsang. Please proceed. Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I had a couple of questions in terms of your margins. We've seen a very nice pickup in your gross margins this quarter. I was wondering if you can sort of walk us through the drivers of that and sort of can we squeeze out more efficiencies on the gross margin side. And then secondly, if you can reiterate for us sort of your medium to long-term operating margin targets and sort of what markets are we going to see the most leverage from, is it from SG&A – I mean is it from sales and marketing or G&A or other areas? Thanks so much. Cindy Xiaofan Wang - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Yeah. So, for the gross margin, I think the most important reason is because in the last couple of years, we invested heavily in the IT technologies to automize all the service – backend service offerings. From a customers' perspective, actually if you use Ctrip, maybe you don't feel any difference between if a customer pick up your phone or we use like a machine to answer your basic questions. And to some extent actually, we closely monitor, for example, the NPS, the customer satisfaction ratios. Those ratio continuously to improve. So this is one of the reasons we kind of bear the fruit from the investment we made in the last couple of years. And the second, the minor reason is because Skyscanner's business model, they have the metasearch model. So their gross margin – they bring us about 1% to 1.5% increase in the gross margin. Yeah, as always, we will continuously improve our operational efficiency across all the business lines going forward, but I think the 80% gross margin has already reflected the very scalable business and efficient business models we have. So we believe the 80% would be pretty consistent at least in the next couple of quarters. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Justin Patterson. Please proceed. Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thank you very much management. And congratulations on another strong quarter. Two if I may. First on the MakeMyTrip capital raise you participated in recently. Could you talk about just what you've learned from being an investor in MakeMyTrip about penetrating the India market? And then secondly on Skyscanner, you mentioned some of your efforts to improve conversion on that platform. Could you discuss how quickly that's rolling along, how quickly you expect that to reach what you were able to achieve with Qunar? Thank you. Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Sure. For MakeMyTrip, we believe the Indian market is at the stage where China was 10 to 20 years ago. And the population is the second largest, upcoming to take over as the largest population in the whole world. That is why we are very positive in the market, although it might take some time. So the investment we made in MakeMyTrip is very helpful in terms of knowledge sharing and experience sharing because the two markets have experienced intense competition, and there are lot of things that we can share together. So we work very closely with the team by sharing our knowledge, our product, our past experience with them. And MakeMyTrip is the dominant – is the largest OTA in Indian market, and we are positive in the future, they will grow very well into this faster growing market. The second question is Skyscanner. Skyscanner and Ctrip are working very closely on the IT front to make the direct booking accessible for Skyscanner's team, and our original plan is by the end of the year, the first booking will be pushed through, but our both IT team worked very hard. So the first booking was pushed through a few weeks ago, much earlier than we expected. So we're very positive in moving forward to improve the service and users' experience on Skyscanner by providing the direct booking onto their sites. So it's moving much smoother and also faster than we originally planned. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap. Please proceed. Alicia Yap - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd. Hi, good morning, James, Jane and Cindy. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a follow-up question on the margin. I think Cindy you mentioned earlier that Skyscanner margins is consistent with the Ctrip China margins. So I just wonder if the Ctrip China margins is lower than the group reported margins, so actually excluding Skyscanner this quarter, the reported margin would have been higher, right? So, just wanted to get that sense. And then second is overall on your margins outlook, given your continued effort to expand into the global branding and also the lower tier cities, just wonder what would be the sales and marketing lines to be and then, well, Skyscanner also have the marketing spend as well to also impact the margins. Thank you. Cindy Xiaofan Wang - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Yeah. Ctrip, as always – we always continue to – first priority given we're still in the very early stage of our development with huge potentials both domestically and internationally. So we are in the very early stage. Our top priority is still to continuously gaining market share, firstly, in the lower tier city of China and secondly in the international market. And so, overall speaking, even with this top priority, given we already have the dominant position especially in the China market, we are very confident that our margin will go back to the non-GAAP 20% to 30% level in the next one to two years. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jia Long Shi. Please proceed. Jia Long Shi - Nomura International (Hong Kong) Ltd. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And I have two follow-ups. And for the CCA investigation, I think, Cindy, you mentioned earlier based on your observation the conversion rate actually has continued to improve. So I just wonder did you mean the conversion rate for the cross-selling service actually continued to improve even after you have made some adjustments recently to your practice of cross-selling in response to CCA investigation. For the Skyscanner, I understand you're trying to transform Skyscanner from a traffic generation model to direct booking model, which is similar to your own air ticketing service. I just wonder when you talk to those overseas airlines, what are their feedback to such a change in Skyscanner's service model? Are they cooperative in terms of allowing their passengers to complete the air ticketing booking within Skyscanner's website instead of those airlines' website? Thank you. Cindy Xiaofan Wang - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Yes. We – actually our air ticketing team there working very hard to find the most appropriate and useful product to cross-selling together with the air ticket. For example, the VIP Lounge service is over 50% of the customers, they choose once – select – will add them to the next shopping, which tells you how important and useful those cross-selling product is. And also, we believe Ctrip has – in the last couple years, we invested heavily in terms of both the pricing as well as the comprehensiveness of our international air ticket. So overall speaking, we believe as long as we can meet or even to some extent always provide the product that to some extent even exceed some of the customers' expectation, Ctrip has the value proposition to make profit at the most efficient distribution in the air distribution industry. And regarding Skyscanner, yes, actually Skyscanner, they provide marketplaces that offers carriers very strong branding controls through their storefronts whereby carriers can actually easily display their full range of products. And at the same time, travelers will also enjoy a more similar experience of selecting from a variety of air ticket choices, for example, the price choices or the seat selections, while they're interacting with the airline (48:18) during their bookings after they introduced direct booking. So we believe we already see a very positive – or the direct booking engines are very well received by all the airlines. Operator Again, ladies and gentlemen for questions, we're taking questions from analysts and you may ask one question per queue. If you have an additional question, you may queue back up for questions. Our next question comes from the line of Ming Xu. Please proceed. Ming Xu - UBS Securities (Asia) Ltd. Thanks, management, for taking my question and congratulation on strong quarter. Also some questions on take rate. So first of all, can you share with us the current take rate on the hotel side for Ctrip and for Qunar separately? And then given your market share in China and also the – we noticed that hotels operations are also improving recently. Is there any plan or potential for you to further raise the take rate on the hotel side? And we also noticed that you have launched several schemes such as step-up commission rate structure and also the prepaid hotel products. Are these products going to help you to actually raise your take rate on the hotel side? And finally (49:47 – 49:52). Cindy Xiaofan Wang - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Thank you. So our hotel take rate has been pretty consistent. Before couponing, our growth take rate on the hotel is about 10% to 15%. But we still keep a certain level of the couponing, especially in the lower tier – in the lower end of the market to make sure that we have the most competitive pricing in those markets. So the net take rate is about 8% to 10% on the hotel side. If you then – yes, definitely, there is room for us to further increase our net take rate on the hotel side. But given that for the hotel business both domestically and internationally, we are still in the very, very early stage. We have only single-digit of the total market share in the hotel segment. Our top priority is to further expand our market share both domestically as well as the international hotel markets. So we don't have the plan to increase significantly on the take rate. Rather we will grow our business mainly driven by the very healthy volume growth on the hotel side. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Juan Lin. Please proceed. Juan Lin - 86Research Ltd. Hi. Good morning, James, Jane and Cindy. Congratulations on another strong quarter. I have a follow-up question on gross margin. Could you help us to rank the gross margins of your different business lines? In particular, could you share with us the margin trend for your accommodation booking business, as you continue to penetrate into low tier cities? And also a quickly follow-up on the OPAC, your plan is opening 1,000 more franchise stores, whether you are going to leverage the retail stores of Bestone or are these all brand new stores and how will the plan impact the outlook of OPAC? Thank you. Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Yeah. These stores are franchise stores, so within one year, they will be profitable, so the strategic value for them to bring us is coupled with our penetration into the lower tier cities. We want to make sure it's a full product offering, penetrating strongly into the lower tier cities. So we're not only offering air tickets and hotels, the two main products, we are also offering packaged tour, train, bus, ferry, rental car, et cetera. With this comprehensive product offering, we'll be able to attract more customers from the lower tier cities. So the Bestone store in these cities will become a really valuable penetration method in terms of have the first-hand contact with our targeted customers. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tian Hou. Please proceed. Tian X. Hou - T. H. Capital LLC Morning, management. Couple of questions. The first one is regarding the transportation. It's grown really rapidly. I would like to gain some details about the contributions from different parts of the transportation in both revenue and volume. What's the contribution from the train, from the bus, from the air in the revenue and volume? So, that is the question one. The number two question... Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Within the transportation, the reason you see very healthy or rapid growth is firstly because our small business units including the train ticket, bus ticket and car services, all those small business lines they grow pretty significantly triple-digit growth. And in terms of the volumes, the train ticket already surpassed the air ticket to become the largest contributor in the transportation ticketing in terms of volumes. In terms of a revenue, train, bus as well as rental car services total contributed about 15% to 20% of our total transportation revenues, and the other reason is our addition of Skyscanner business. As you may know, Skyscanner, vast majority of their revenues coming from the air ticket. So, that's also the reason the transportation ticket has much higher growth rate than other business lines. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alex Yao. Please proceed. Alex Yao - JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. First question is a follow-up on gross margin. So if I understand correctly, the reason for gross margin improvement this quarter are two-folds. One is that you used more machine to replace labor services in the call center, which reduced fixed cost and then second reason is because the Skyscanner cost structure difference. So I think these two reasons are both structural and that the gross margin should be at least flattish at this level, but once we factor in the seasonality, that basically suggests that your gross margin will continue to improve in the next few quarters. Is this a correct statement? Secondly, I want to hear your thoughts on the lower tier investment strategy. Can you talk about, from product offering, competitive landscape and the return on investment perspective? How do lower tier city differs to the high tier city? Thank you. Jane Jie Sun - Ctrip.com International Ltd. Sure. Thanks, Alex. First of all, on the margin, because we pushed very hard to improve IT system, the automation, robotic technology has taken off in our platform. We do have the ability to increase our scalability without adding more people. So the scale is there. So you are right. If we look at our existing portfolio, the margin improvements will be very much anticipated. However, as a fast-growing company, we always want to innovate and penetrate into the new market. So we will reserve sufficient funds and the resources to penetrate into the untouched market, and the second tier and third tier cities are our target this year. So we will use the savings on certain area and use these resources to help us to expand into the new markets in the second tier and third tier cities. And your question on investment in new product and ROI, again we normally start with the most significant products and most significant and profitable markets. So the first tier cities, Ctrip has very strong branding in these areas. And second tier cities and coastal areas are also very profitable. So we have strong hold in these profitable markets. And then we are looking to the new markets. And so we penetrate further into the third tier and fourth tier cities. These cities are relatively green and also GDP per capita is not reaching our target yet. However, by taking these new markets and offering comprehensive products into these area along with our sales and marketing expansion, we will be able to educate these new customers and grow them into our portfolio going forward, and they will become our new customers. So the initial investment of the ROI will be lower than the matured market, but for us, these are the new markets. We're not targeting to make too much money from them, but our target is aggressively gain market share. And our improved margins will enable us not only to penetrate into these lower tier cities, but also show a healthy expansion into the market. So our goal are three things. First of all, aggressive top line growth; second, expansion and healthy margin; third, aggressive investment into the new market. So we will be able to achieve these three goals simultaneously through the hard work from our IT team as well as our service and product teams.
