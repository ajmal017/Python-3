With me today are John Daane, our CEO; and Ron Pasek, Chief Financial Officer. After Ron and John’s initial remarks, we will take your questions. Prior to the Q&A session, the operator will be giving instructions on how you can access the conference call with your questions. We are aware of recent M&A rumors in the press. Altera has a long-standing policy to not comment on market rumors and therefore we ask that you refrain from asking related questions today, since we will not be able to respond. I would now like to turn the call over to Ron. Ronald Pasek Thank you, Scott. The first quarter proved to be more challenging than we expected with revenue decreasing 9% sequentially. With respect to gross margin several of our higher than average gross margin vertical markets underperformed versus our forecasted expectations. Industrial, test, compute and storage, and to a lesser extent military, fell short of our forecast. Additionally, within wireless our business was more pronounced in radio and less in baseband. Operating expense was below guidance due to mask and wafer timing, and some favorable foreign exchange. In addition, favorable discrete tax items reduced our tax rate in the quarter. The combined under-spend in operating expense and a lower tax rate allowed us essentially to meet our EPS guidance. We repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares in the quarter and we have $134 million left to complete the share repurchase that we previously announced in Q4 2013. Given the softness in Q1, for Q2 we are being cautious with our guidance of down 4% to 8%. Our telecom and wireless business, and particularly our wireless business globally looks to be quite weak in second quarter, while the rest for our business will in aggregate be flat to slightly up. We expect favorable vertical market mix in industrial, military, broadcast, and compute and storage, and as a result our forecasting a gross margin rebound into the 66.5% to 67.5% range. Consistent with my comments last quarter, our gross margin should continue to increase through the year, which will allow us to achieve the lower-end of the planned gross margin rate. At this point, we do see sequential growth returning in Q3 2015. In addition, assuming the dollar stays strong globally, we have $10 million to $13 million of foreign-exchange favorability to the $760 million operating expense plan. Finally, we did not complete or expect to buy-back in Q1 and we don’t know when we’ll be able to finish the remainder of the repurchase, which was expected to be completed by the end of Q2. Now, let me turn the call over to John. John Daane Thank you, Ron. We are in the midst of an unfortunate perfect storm in the wireless industry, where capital equipment delays from carriers in China, Japan, the US, and some developing countries are causing temporary decline in our wireless business in Q1 and Q2. Based on customer forecasts we expect the business to bottom in Q2 and grow through the back-half of the year. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be down 4% to 8% sequentially, again caused by delays in carrier spending. However, we expect strong growth in the computer server acceleration market and also double-digit sequential growth in our industrial IOT market. Despite the near-term revenue volatility, the long-term secular opportunity for FPGAs remains compelling. IoT, cloud computing, and big data analytics are providing new growth engines for the PLD industry. Because FPGAs are well-suited to manage motors, actuators, and cameras, our opportunity pipeline has significantly expanded not only for traditional industrial manufacturing equipment, but also for IoT systems and applications including security cameras with built-in analytics, smart grid, manufacturing process control and monitoring, robotics, and drones to name a few. The transfer of data from IoT sensors and devices to the cloud for processing will continue to fuel investments in the communications infrastructure where PLDs already have great success. And in the cloud, FPGAs are now being adopted in servers for acceleration as has been announced by our customers including Microsoft and IBM among others. In Microsoft’s case they were able to speed Bing search by 95% using our FPGAs, while also reducing the number of servers required by roughly one-half. Microsoft has moved on to announce performance gains using our FPGAs for many other applications as well. In summary, while we are disappointed with the near-term impact from the wireless industry on our business, we remain confident in the growth of the PLD industry through applications including IoT, automotive, communications and server acceleration. We are also confident in our ability to drive solid EPS growth given the significant operating leverage in our model. Now, let me turn the call back to Scott. Scott Wylie We would now like to take questions. Please limit your questions to one at a time, so that we give as many callers as possible the opportunity to ask questions during the call. Operator, would you please provide instructions and pull for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Yes, sir, Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go ahead and take our first question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore Great, thank you. I guess the question 99% of people asking you won’t be able to answer. So I’ll focus on a couple of other things. You had said that you would make the 10-nanometer decision by the end of the first quarter. Is there any update for us on that? John Daane Yeah, Joe, 10-nanometer I did say we would make a decision by the end of this quarter, or excuse me, in the end of Q1. We have not. It’s a complex decision. Maybe I should just kind of walk through some of the complexity behind it so you understand where we are. Traditionally Altera has had very few manufacturing partners, and we have had deep partnerships with those companies. And that has afforded us I think a lot of value. When we looked at other foundries outside of TSMC, that have been our long partner, of course we wanted to preserve a lot of the benefits that we had seen through the TSMC agreement. So there are three basic factors that I would say we evaluate when we select a foundry partner. One is the technology roadmap obviously, did they have the technology capabilities that we need and will they make some customization of that. Number two, the service and support, very critical for what we need. And then the third item, of course, is the commercial terms, which includes pricing and yield. In general I would say, we’re very comfortable with the technology roadmaps of both Intel and TSMC. And then on the service and support side, I would say as a pure-play foundry and obviously again as a longtime partner we’re very comfortable with TSMC’s service and support. Intel, since they are new to being a pure-play foundry or new to the foundry industry in general, we decided to negotiate a contract to put in a lot of the important elements into the contract to make sure that we got things that we needed. And we ended up I think publishing that contract online in April of 2013. And that includes, just again to kind of go back over to a couple different items that we talked about in the past. One is we manufacture for longer than normal companies, because of some of our customers a very long tails like industrial, military, and to some extent telecom, and so Intel agreed to 12 year manufacturing. We want to make sure that we get the focus and support from the foundry which we’ve always traditionally gotten. Therefore, we do not want to compete with our foundry and we agreed that Intel would not invest in, develop their own product line or buy a PLD company or buy another PLD company. We agreed in that contract that as an example that we would be the only major FPGA company to have access to 14-nanometer. So there were a lot of things that we’ve done that make us now feel very comfortable about the service and support elements of Intel. And then the third gets down to again the commercial side and I would say that has become a little bit more complex recently. And so we’re spending a little bit more time to review that and make sure that we make the right decision. So we haven’t made the vendor selection yet, for 10 still open and still having discussions. Joe Moore Okay. And if I could just follow up on that, when you say the commercial side, I guess, what specifically is the complication there or the issue that still needs to be hashed out? John Daane Commercial gets down into pricing and yield. Yield is an easy function in terms of yield projections that you get from the foundries; pricing and other commercial terms of the areas that are still under discussion, Joe. Joe Moore Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. John Daane Thank you very much. Next question, please. Operator Next question comes from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. Hans Mosesmann Thank you. I have - I didn’t expect to come here so early a bit. My question, John, is on the datacenter side or the acceleration market. When you say that with Microsoft deploying in their Bing search your FPGAs, they are able to reduce the number of servers in half. What is the total upfront cost relative to the solution that you’re displacing. John Daane I think that the feedback that we’ve had is that our solution is much more cost-effective than GPUs, both because the total solution of the FPGA is lower from a cost of component plus heat-sink, also the power is an order of magnitude lower. And as you know Hans the power is the number one spend in a datacenter. Compared to a processor what we’ve heard is pricing is similar and again the advantage of using the FPGA is it will accelerate mathematics algorithms. Microsoft has put out all this data and I think continues to put out a lot of data on the value of FPGAs beyond search. So they looked at many other areas and many other applications within their company. IBM has also put out some similar statistics where they’ve - for their POWER8 series using our FPGAs and announced that for many applications it reduces the number of servers required as well. Hans Mosesmann Okay. Thanks and as a quick follow-up can you give us a sense of the investment in the compiler technology to get an FPGA to work practically in acceleration. How much time and effort or investment is required? Thanks. John Daane It took us several years of development to develop a compiler from OpenCL. It’s also an investment in hardware accelerator blocks that we developed for our library that customers can access and it will continue to be a very significant investment for us to open up the market. Now, it’s not just for a cloud or big data analytics. It also works for a series of other markets. We’ve seen that the military market and high-performance computing has been very interested in OpenCL as a compiler. We’ve also had other markets including medical and computer peripherals such as high-end printers. They’ve also been interested and are using OpenCL from us. So it was a technology originally we developed to access the server space, but is applicable to a broader market segment and where we broadly rolled that technology out. Hans Mosesmann Thank you. John Daane Thank you very much, Hans. Next question, please. Operator Next question comes from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse. John Pitzer Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. Thanks for letting me ask the question. John, just help me understand why you’re comfortable you’re going to see sequential growth in the September quarter, specifically in the telecom and wireless space. You’re down to sort of revenue levels, if I’m doing the math right in the June quarter that we haven’t seen since really the post-3G kind of fall off. And then, if you look at sort of this LTE cycle, which hasn’t been nearly as robust as a 3G cycle. So as you mentioned in your opening comments we’re kind of in the perfect storm. How do you think we got here? And why are you confident that Q3 will be a resumption of sequential growth. John Daane Okay, John, let me give some more color on wireless, because I think that’s the primary driver of this. As I mentioned, the slowdown that we see is across several geographies and it’s rare that we do see a slowdown across multiple major geographies. But certainly Japan, U.S. and now China are soft and each is a little bit different. And in Japan and China, we’ve seen some aggressive pricing rolled out because of competition and therefore we’ve seen some of the carriers adjust their CapEx budgets in order to improve their P&L. We have seen this phenomenon in the past, particularly out of Japan and what has happened is extended to be a 3 month to 6 month adjustment in terms of carrier spending before they start to return or resume to what was their normal life level. Additionally, in the United States the spectrum auctions that have been ongoing cause some of the carriers to limit capital in the short run, so that they could improve their cash positions to be able to pay for the spectrum. I think that will play through fairly quickly this year and we’ll see a return in the back-half of the year and probably both Japan and the U.S. More importantly to this is China. And I think if you look at China the explanation, I don’t think it’s well out there, but it’s pretty simple. That is a China has now, where it’s now going through an audit of their state-owned enterprises. So this has been something that’s been publicly released. And what we’re seeing as the carriers are going through this audit, they’re basically shutting down or severely limiting how much capital or how many orders that they put out for this given period of time. And so that’s what’s causing the very significant slowdown in China for 3G as well as 4G deployments, but predominantly 4G. Now in particular, we don’t think that this is going to last for a long period of time. China Unicom actually has already gone through their audit. Right now telecom and mobile are in their audit. And what we hear and what we expect both from our customers as well as in discussion with carriers is that they’re expecting calendar quarter Q3-Q4 that the business will pick back up as they have completed that audit phase. Importantly, this is not related to for us any design loss or any market share loss. It’s simply the way in deployments and again we expect to pick up in the back-half of the year. And I think you’re hearing similar announcements from other semiconductor companies. I think yesterday, Xilinx and the Texas Instruments for example said that they saw similar down ticks in the wireless industry in particular. Now unfortunately, wireless has proven to be volatile for the PLD industry and probably more particularly for Altera, because we have a larger business base in wireless and it’s a larger percentage of our company’s revenues, then the PLD and for that matter I think anybody else. And if you just go back in time, you can see the - so Scott pulled some data going back over the last six years looking at the last 24 quarters. And what you find is in the last 24 quarters 13 of them we either - our wireless business either went up or down sequentially more than 10%. And in eight of those quarters were one-third at that period of time it was up or down more than 20% sequentially. So we’ve seen the wireless volatility. Historically, it’s been tied to sometimes geographies turn on or turn off, sometimes it’s multiple geographies getting together. And again based on what we’re hearing from our customers as well as the operators, we do expect that this is temporary and the business is going to pick up starting significantly in the third calendar quarter. John Pitzer That’s helpful, John. Then quickly, it’s my follow up. Ron, I want to make sure I heard you correct on the gross margin line. Did you say that you expect to see continued sequential growth after the June quarter in gross margins and just given the mix shift back to wireless, which is usually a lower gross margin product? Is there other - what’s your takes on the gross margin line that can allow you to continue to rise throughout the year? Ronald Pasek Yeah, John, this is consistent with what I said on our December 10 call, when I laid out the plan then what we’d expect to see for gross margin through the year in our call last quarter as well. And there are other factors besides mix, mix is the dominant one, but there are other obviously elements to the cost side and the price side. So, yes, it should continue to increase throughout the year. John Pitzer Thank you. That’s helpful, guys. I appreciate it. John Daane Thank you very much, John. Next question, please. Operator Next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Unidentified Analyst This is Steve for Tristan. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is on gross margin. What is the gross margin differential for you between 20-nanometer and 28-nanometer, and getting up back to a single architecture at the 20-nanometer? John Daane Honestly between nodes the gross margin is not that different. I wouldn’t expect over the long-term to see any significant difference by node. As you just heard previously generally because of volume in different end markets where gross margin is a function of vertical market mix. So obviously customers that buy more, get better pricing, that tends to be then the biggest driver of gross margin variance. Unidentified Analyst All right. Thank you. That’s helpful. And my second question is related to 28-nanometer. If 28 is the longest node for FPGA so far, could you just maybe talk a little bit about the ramification of the slowdown on your capital structure? And do you slowdown CapEx going forward in order to maintain your ROI? John Daane Well, I think we have to realize we are a fabulous company. So we do not invest in manufacturing equipment. Capital for us is computers and software predominantly EDA Software that we would lease in order to develop our chip. So we would not adjust based on node or volume of any particular node. In general, I’m not sure 28-nanometer is necessarily going to be the longest live node in PLD industry’s history. I don’t think there is going to be any different from any other node. Typically, from introduction, we see a peak five-year, six-year, seven-year, and then at tail last few years afterwards. And I think 28-nanometer will be the same as any other node for us. So, yes, doesn’t change what we are doing or how we are investing as a company. Unidentified Analyst All right. Thank you. John Daane Thank you very much. Next question, please? Operator Next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Unidentified Analyst Hi. Thank you for taking my question. This is Julie [ph] for Ross Seymore. Can you give some additional color on why the industrial military auto segment was down double-digits in the March quarter? And given the weakness, how should we think about the growth for this segment in 2015? John Daane So what was down in the calendar quarter Q1 and we actually did or predict us when we had our call for Q4 is, industrial was down and military was down. Military is typically down in the first calendar quarter, that has to do with seasonality or spend of government budgets, and so that’s what we saw. Military is pulling back up this quarter and is going to grow substantially, again on a normal season pattern. Industrial was oddly down in the first calendar quarter and that is not usual. We would have expected it to perform better. I think what we were seeing is some adjustment by companies as they were adjusting in Europe and Japan to the stronger dollar. Ultimately though, we were able to call that correction for the quarter, it did happen. And overall, we are expecting that industrial will grow for us double-digit sequentially this quarter, so it’s really roaring back. And those were the two main impacts, overall, automotive was up in the quarter. Unidentified Analyst Okay. Thank you. And given the lower revenue growth profile for the year, how should we think about OpEx guidance that was given previously, any changes? Ronald Pasek No, with the exception of the - of foreign exchange benefit that we predict given the strong dollar if it continues $10 million to $13 million, I’m not changing the full-year OpEx at this point. John Daane Thank you very much. Next question, please? Operator Our next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. James Covello Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. Going back to Joe Moore’s first question on the 10-nanometer decision, is it a two-horse race for the foundry decision, or could there be more players potentially involved? John Daane Right now, it’s a two-horse race. James Covello Okay. Thank you. And then going back to Hans’s question on the accelerator market, could you walk us through a timeframe, where that could potentially become a meaningful portion of the quarterly revenue? What do you think a reasonable sign post would be for us to think about the FPGA accelerator market, representing something that say you might have to breakout separately? John Daane I think if you sort of look at all of our vertical markets in general, we expect very broad-based growth across all. We do expect the computer, industrial, and automotive will likely be for the next several years, as we’ve discussed in the past, the fastest growing. But because we expect growth from all of our vertical markets, we’re not necessarily expecting that there will be a dramatic shift in the next year or two. In general, the opportunity for us in servers is very, very large, and we put out the $1 billion opportunity in the past you’re seeing in Nvidia how strong growth in this area. We think we have a more compelling product just simply because of the performance and power benefit, so we have over GPUs, and it’s a new space. Overall, I’d say computer is probably for us about, I don’t know how to break it out, I was going to say maybe 8% of revenue overall. So you can tell that it’s already become significant for us. We expect that this area probably will grow 20% to 30% compound annual and maybe that gives you sort of some metrics to use in terms of thoughts of how it’s going to grow. Certainly, it’s a great opportunity. We talked about Microsoft. We talked about IBM, but there are a lot more customers that we’re working with right now that are deploying or are doing the development right now and plan to deploy over the next couple of years. So I think we’ve gone from this being a concept to now being a reality and growing quite well for us. James Covello Incredibly helpful. Thanks a lot. Good luck. John Daane Okay. Thank you very much. Next question, please? Operator Next question comes from Doug Freedman with RBC. Doug Freedman Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess, if I could start in on one of your - your main competitor talked about a slower ramp in their 28-nanometer product portfolio than they might have expected a year ago. What are you guys seeing on that front? And can give us a guidepost on where your 28-nanometer finished the quarter? John Daane I am not familiar with what they may have said. So unfortunately, I’m not in a position to be able to comment at all on slow growth. I think in general, 28-nanometer has done very well. Overall, we ended the year roughly at about 40% market share, and we ended the quarter also at about 48% market - or 40%, excuse me, the market share as well for 28-nanometer. Our overall market share as a company is for FPGAs versus our larger competitor is about 38%. So the fact that we’re doing that well in 40 and for that matter, the several nodes before that says that in general we should expect to take market share over the years to come. So that - hopefully, that answers and gives a little color on 28-nanometer. Doug Freedman Okay. If I could you had talked about your 14-nanometer progress. Can you give us an update on where that stands in effect just sort of walk one more on the OpEx side. Are there any advisor fees in the numbers that you’ve guided to? John Daane So for me on 14-nanometer there’s no change. We plan to sample in the fall of this year. Doug Freedman Great. Thank you. John Daane Thank you very much. Another question or next question, please? Operator Next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities. Srini Pajjuri Thank you. John, given the volatility in the business, how should we think about a normalized run rate for your - in a quarterly revenues? And then whatever that is, do you expect to get there in the second-half, I know, you talked about recovering the second-half of this year? And then also I’m thinking, I’m looking at your operating margins, they’ve been in the mid-20s for a while and then probably going to low-20s, I know you have a higher target longer-term. But on a normalized basis, how do we get up this mid-20 or low-20 operating margin in the model? John Daane Well, to answer it backwards, I think if you look at the model the way that we are able to move back into the low-30s operating margin, which is our target is, we are constraining expenses moving forward. So this year, last year, and the years going forward, we want to basically keep our expenses, SG&A and R&D flat plus or minus a couple percent and you’ve seen us do that. Second element is, we’ve been operating last year with lower gross margins than we think are where the company should operate. We think we’re more in the 67% margin on average level. You’re seeing the expansion of our gross margins now, both which are because of mix, but it also because of continuing cost containment and operating costs improvements that we make and we’ll continue to make as a corporation. So that will help the op margin side. And then the third element is, overall, you’ll get the revenue growth and coupled with high gross margins that will flow down very, very well to the bottom line. So that’s the thesis you’ve seen us from the past from us. I think if you look at 2008 versus 2010 or 2011, you saw a lot of op margin expansion as we had revenue growth. And I do think we have a lot of revenue opportunity in a lot of markets. The other element that you asked, it’s, we’ve commented before. It’s very difficult to predict seasonality in our particular industry. So I can’t give you the - what would be a normal growth rate for a particular quarter. In terms of what will wireless do in Q3 or Q4, we don’t have enough visibility to be able to point out exactly what the number will be. We know we will grow in Q3. We know, because we will grow in wireless, so the overall company will grow. Overall, will wireless get back to the levels in Q1 or Q4? We don’t have that sort of visibility right now. But we know it’s going to come back strongly, and we do anticipate, we’ll get strong company growth in the third calendar quarter from that. Srini Pajjuri Okay, great. That’s helpful. And then I understand you don’t want to discuss the speculation out there. But my question is assuming hypothetically if there was an offer on the table, can you talk about some of the factors that you would look at to whether to accept and offer or reject an offer? John Daane So as Scott said earlier, our policy is not to comment on rumors or hypothetical M&A transactions or hypothetical elements or may or may not happen within our particular industry. All I guess I would say is a - I took a step back is that, our board fully understands its fiduciary responsibility. We are intent on enhancing shareholder value, and we are agnostic as to the path to get there. Srini Pajjuri Thank you. John Daane Thank you very much. Next question, please? Operator Next question comes from Ruben Roy with Piper Jaffray. Ruben Roy Thank you. John, you’d mentioned a bit on around your discussion of the China base station market, some pressure and some reallocation of CapEx given perhaps the rate of subscriber adds or something like that. And I was wondering in terms of your design activity, which I assume is ongoing despite the order pause. Have you seen anything, that would indicate that we might see some pricing pressure in the base station market, as you look out maybe in the second-half of this year into 2016? John Daane Base stations tend not to change that often. And so you’re typically seeing an architectural shift for our customers on a two-year to four-year cycle on base stations just because of the complexity of the systems. Radios, of course, there are so many frequencies and there are so many different features in radios. Many of the vendors are developing 60 to 100 different radios a year. So there’s more opportunity for products cost reductions or product replacements just to give you an idea of the cycle. Overall, I would say, there’s really no difference or change in market pressure in terms of pricing today for products as they were as it was a year ago or two years ago. Customers obviously would like more features at a lower price. We try to design that through new generations of technology and hopefully, if we get that right, we’ll continue to grow as a company. Ruben Roy That’s helpful, John. I guess just as a follow-up then, is there interest in the base station - in baseband specifically, area of the base station market for 14-nanometer technology. And if so when do you think you might start shipping some of those devices into the platforms? John Daane We will have, as an example, we’ll have base station shipping on 20-nanometer products from Altera this year. Those have been in design for a couple of years now. I think what you’re going to see is 14-nanometer if I were to guess. 2017, perhaps, you’ll see companies entering into production using our own 14-nanometer FPGAs at that time. Ruben Roy Great. Thanks, John. John Daane For base stations. Thank you very much. Next question, please? Operator Next question comes from Christopher Rolland with FBR Capital Markets. Unidentified Analyst Hey, guys. This is Joe on for Chris. Thanks. Let me ask the question. I was just curious what you guy’s overall thoughts were on moving towards the lower end of the market. Do you think Altera to have a replace in the mobile handsets or consumer products group? John Daane Joe, our focus is not to go after battery-operated appliances or applications. It really requires you to develop and different process type and you develop different architectures from what we have today. So where we have done some lower power products and where we do have low-end FPGAs and CPLDs that address a broad range of applications. Today, we’re not targeted in general on areas like handsets or tablets. Unidentified Analyst Okay, great, thanks. And then as a follow-up, I was intrigued by your wireless spectrum comments earlier. Do you think and you said you’re pretty comfortable there. What gives you comfort that’s a short-term phenomenon, and do you think that will impact on your emerging markets going forward, could we see an environment where all around we’ll see lower CapEx lowered going forward? John Daane Well, I think probably CapEx does not get lower going forward. I think it’s been fairly consistent for a long period of time. What is a little bit confusing in the CapEx numbers is, there’s - in the U.S. and in the U.S. accounting system, the carriers in the U.S. can include a lot of elements that are not what we would traditionally think of capital. So they can include labor. They can include consulting. They can include software. So it’s many times I think for people that are getting data maybe confusing as to what’s actually happening. We do see fluctuations where some quarters are stronger than others. But in general, if you look at the market, there is still need to build out capacity for 4G and 3G throughout the world, and there is a very strong push towards 5G in particular, because what’s happening as you can see with the U.S. there’s a number of carriers are ending up with spectrum that is not contiguous. And therefore they need to manage this and string it together. And so they’re going to need the newer radio styles that are going to come with 4.5G, 5G, which will require all new equipment deployments in order to take advantage of all this new spectrum that they are buying and to more efficiently use the spectrum that they already have. And so in general, I think there’s going to be a continued need to see further spends on wireless and wireline for many years to come. Unidentified Analyst Great. Thank you. John Daane Thank you very much. Next question, please? Operator Next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya Thanks for taking my question. John, one more on wireless especially in China. Are you seeing any excess inventory or base stations or base stations that were pre-built or any move towards smaller cells. I’m just trying to understand whether this overhang on FPGA demand, will it persist even when Telco CapEx is relieved just because it happens to be pre-built base stations or whether carriers because of capacity needs start moving more towards smaller cells? John Daane So for that in China, in particular, the answer is, yes, some of the existing products that our customers have, they will use to ship as the audits are completed, which is why we’re seeing the very significant downtick. In other words, where customers lined up doing is using this as an opportunity or time that they will bleed off the inventory and then start to return to orders from us in the third calendar quarter as those carriers, the two that are left complete their overall audits. And so that is factored into this big dip that we’re seeing in both like Q1 and Q2 in our wireless business and ultimately where we expected to spring back. So that idea of that some of our customers who have inventory has already been factored in. In terms of small cells, we do have content in small cells, and what has now come back is a change in forecast and that, there will be far fewer small cells deployed in China than previously thought. The carriers there are just not as interested in the technology. So that in particular is not going to ship in the volumes that we’re projected late last year or even earlier this year, does not have a tremendous impact to us, because we have far more dollar content, and the macro base stations and obviously the radios themselves. Vivek Arya Very helpful. And then as my follow-up, Ron, could you remind us again what’s causing the gross margins to be so much different than your competitor who was putting up 69%, 70% gross margin, because I think historically, you have always outperformed then. So what’s causing this pressure now and what can help to close the gap over the next few quarters? Thank you. Ronald Pasek Yes, thanks for the question. So there’s three things that really causing this in my opinion. Number one is, our competitor has a Last Time Buy that’s been going on for probably well over 2.5 years, we do not have such a Last Time Buy. They do about twice the amount of militarily business we do, which is obviously one of the higher gross margin verticals. And as I said last quarter, we have two 10% customers. We had two 10% customers last year, they have zero. So all things being equal, those put a little more pressure on gross margin, because they do higher volumes. John Daane And they particularly are more oriented towards the wireless business, which we’ve mentioned many times as lower gross margin. However do take a step back and I think we have to congratulate them for the fact that they are operating extremely well and give them credit for that as well. Vivek Arya Thank you. John Daane Thank you very much. Next question, please? Operator Next question comes from any Chris Danely with Citi. Chris Danely Yes, thanks, guys. I guess just a follow-up on the last question from Vivek on the gross margin. So quick clarification, do you have two 10% customers this quarter, and then you talk about your higher gross margin markets have underperformed, and your mixes in wireless is lower. Is there any sort of taking a step back, is there any sort of common driver there? And I guess, can you just give us some confidence that this is going to stop, and I know you talked some sort of non-mix ways you can improve margins and maybe elaborate on those? Ronald Pasek Yes, so consistent with what I side when we articulated plan in December of last year some of the higher margin verticals for the year are going to be the primary growth verticals for us, and that’s what you’re seeing mainly from Q1 to Q2 and it’s going to continue as the year progresses. John Daane I think if you step back to last year as an example our gross margins did go down. The two verticals for us are sub-verticals that had the strongest growth and far out performed their plan, our plan for them, were wireless and consumer as we mentioned before. And again those were two of the lower gross margin verticals, simply because of the volume that is in those areas. The reason that we had said that gross margins will grow this year is because we expect strong growth out of computer, out of industrial, out of military as examples, and those are all some of our higher gross margin verticals. So mix obviously is better this year. We continue to do cost reductions work on yields, work on material cost reductions, work on continuing to improve design efficiencies, so that we can lower our costs, those are ongoing efforts that we will do certainly every year. And then to your other question, Chris, we will not or we do not expect to have any 10% customers this quarter. Again, as you can imagine our two 10% customers coming out of last year are very heavily focused on wireless and so they’re going to be impacted for us this quarter and therefore we do not anticipate we’re going to have any 10% customers this quarter. Chris Danely Great, thanks. And for my follow-up just a quick on 10-nanometer, do you expect to make a decision on at this quarter? I guess, why would you be hesitating on speaking with Intel? You made this big switch from Taiwan Semi over to Intel. Has something changed there? Has anything like stretched out or change, I guess, why would you be hesitating and what would be involved in switching back to TSMC at 10-nanometer? John Daane So we use third-party tools and we use libraries that come from third-parties and memory cells that come from foundries or third-parties. So it requires infrastructure switch, but since we are currently doing development with both TSMC and Intel today, we could easily switch back and forth between the two, because we’ve got the knowledge and we’ve got the skill-set. And we’ve got all the technology. Adding a third foundry would be a lot of work for us, because it would be all new learning. So because again we’re doing the 20-nanometer technology development with TSMC, we completed a 55-nanometer embedded flash family with TSMC. That relationship is ongoing and is going currently. So we are doing development with both companies. We feel very comfortable with their technology roadmaps as I mentioned. Service and support we’ve established and now it comes down to the commercial term side. So I do anticipate that that decision will be made this quarter, and they will be in a position when it comes to the call next time to let you know where we’re headed. Chris Danely Thanks. John Daane Thank you very much, Chris. Next question please? Operator [Operator Instructions] And we next move to Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple on, we talked a lot about wireless, on wireline you had a reset in December. You’re expecting to come back nicely. Is that going to be out for you in Q2, do you still expect that rebound? And then maybe for the big picture, I know you don’t want to talk about the deal, but just figuring out how to justify $50 or $60 stock price, you need to get at least back to your peak earnings number. With this reset you’re back down, run rate is closer to $1. When you look at PLD industry, the 10% growth, you see a lot of companies resetting growth profiles, thinking about different cost structures. Is that something that you’re looking at or do you still think that PLDs could grow at that rate? John Daane I still think that - and our expectation is for Altera that we should outgrow the overall industry by about 2X. Overall, our expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenue as our revenues grow and that’s something that we have communicated in the model. We expect that we would grow from where we are today in the low 20s in terms op margin to the low 30s, which is our long-term target. We think during that period of time there’s a lot of expansion not only of op margin, but we would expect also from a stock-price perspective, because of the EPS growth. Add to that, we are continuing to work on cash return to shareholders through dividend and the share repurchase even though it’s currently suspended has been very accretive for us as well. And we will continue to focus on cash return to shareholders as much as possible. In terms of telecom I have said in Q4 that for Q1 we expect telecom to be flat. It was slightly down. I think it was down about 2%. So it was roughly flat. The forecast is for it to grow this quarter. I’m kind of hedging that a little bit and I’m thinking that maybe that flips out Q3. So remember in Ron’s opening remarks that he did say we were trying to be very conservative this quarter in terms of the guidance. And that’s one of the elements that we just said. Maybe we see telecom just continue to be flat for now and maybe grow in the back-half of the year. Blayne Curtis Okay. Thank you. John Daane Thank you very much. Next question, please. Operator Next question comes from Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Alex Gauna Thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon, everybody. John, you’ve been around for at least [indiscernible] and we got a clean plate of all the [indiscernible] Xilinx, you, TI. It sure feels like [indiscernible] that might mean there isn’t [indiscernible]. What are your thoughts [indiscernible]. John Daane Thanks, Alex. I think we understood your question your sort of volume is low for us. I think overall, I don’t think that this is the end of the cycle. If you think of semiconductors, typically we’ve seen cycles driven by CapEx spend. So where you know sometimes there’s not enough CapEx spend, capacity drives up, prices go up, industry grows, lot of CapEx spend, too much volume is put in place, prices decline therefore the industry declines. I don’t think that’s the case today. We’re not seeing that CapEx is really run away from what the industry growth rates are and overall recently you have seen a couple of companies adjust their CapEx spending downwards. So I think that’s okay. Ultimately, I think some vertical markets are doing well and some vertical markets are under a little bit of pressure. We’re also susceptible to what’s happening on the macro, so if the macro were to substantially deteriorate, I think we would all be certainly impacted by that. But right now I think if it were not for this wireless delay that I mentioned we would be seeing sequential growth this quarter as well as gross margin expansion this quarter. Alex Gauna Okay, that’s helpful, and sorry about the volume on that last question. If we think about another aspect of what drives the Altera story, you believe for years that you can gain share versus ASIC and ASSP. And at least in the more recent periods here that does not seem to be the case for either you or your peer. What can you say about if that part of the thesis is still in place for you, and if so, why are we seeing that anomaly here in the near-term where a lot of the ASSP players still seem to be outperforming your performance. Thanks. John Daane Well, I think there are different markets, for instance some of the ASSP players have been tied to mobile handsets, we’re not in that particular market. So I think you have to take it a step back and look at particular verticals. And I think if you look at the verticals that we’re in we have been outperforming the semiconductor industry on average over a 3 year to 5 year basis point. In general, if you look at the ASIC market, I would say and go back five, six years ago it has changed substantially. Texas Instruments was at one time one of the top ASIC providers, they’re out. IBM is out having sold off their semiconductor group. It’s not evident to me that global foundries are necessarily carrying that strategy forward. We’ve seen the Japanese companies and many companies in Japan deemphasize ASIC entirely. So I think that industry has been under a lot of pressure as evidenced by the fact that many of the top providers in the top 10 have really exited the overall business, and to a large degree that’s been replaced by either ASSPs and handsets or FPGAs and the infrastructure equipment side. And I think there’s plenty of evidence on the ASIC front that PLDs continue to replace it and that economically really are customers have no choice but to use programmable logic going forward. Alex Gauna Okay. Thank you. Good luck on restoring the momentum. John Daane Thank you very much, Alex. Next question please? Operator Next question comes from Deepon Nag with Macquarie. Deepon Nag Yes. Thanks guys. Could you give us the gross margin for the acceleration business? When you think about the seasonality of that, is it seasonally strong in the back-half of the year relative to the first-half? John Daane So theoretically, if you were a player in the broad space within the computer industry and particularly servers, I would say that you typically do see Q4 stronger and then Q1 weaker in terms of a seasonal pattern. But today, we’re doing business with companies that build their own datacenters is an example and some others, IBM, as I mentioned and Hewlett-Packard. But in the case of companies that build their own data centers, so they are not on our clock, in other words, they will build out a datacenter based on their own clock, and so it’s a little bit different from that perspective. So we haven’t seen a lot of seasonality necessarily with our portion of the computer business, and again, it’s still very early innings in terms of what we can achieve. In terms of gross margins, I think computer in general has been at or above our overall corporate level. Deepon Nag Great, excellent. And on the foundry deal with Intel, how long has Intel compelled to not invest or develop alternative FPGA technologies, if you were to switch to [indiscernible] 10-nanometers? John Daane I think, again, I refer people probably and we have gotten a little bit of interest recently about this through the agreement that is online and for individuals to look at that particular agreement. I don’t know if there are dates establish with it, so I probably just end this by saying, we’re very comfortable with the protections that we negotiated in that agreement. Deepon Nag Got it. Thanks a lot. John Daane Thank you very much. Next question, please? Operator And our final question comes from Anil Doradla with William Blair. Anil Doradla Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in. John, couple of question, so back to that ASIC replacement thesis, when you open up a box today, there are fewer chips out there. So the whole system-on-a-chip is taking a lot more functionality, whether it’s input/output, more memory, processors, and so forth. So what would you say to perhaps some element of criticism that an amount of glue logic that you would need, the amount of FPGA you would need with the rights of SoCs diminishes. Do you think there’s any validity to that thesis? John Daane I think you are correct. In that there may be fewer chips, certainly than when I started where you had TTL logic with four gigs per chip. The number of raw chips is perhaps diminishing the system, and then you’re seeing more integrated SoC’s. And that’s exactly the reason why you’re seeing from us and from Xilinx as well the advents of SoC based PLDs or FPGAs. So if you kind of look at the FPGA evolution 15 years ago, we had only logic in our chips, we then added memory. We then added DSP blocks, which really took on and displaced a lot of what was the traditional DSP industry. We then added transceivers, which took on and replaced a lot of analog components. And mostly, recently, we’ve added microprocessors, so multi-core microprocessors to our FPGAs. So, in fact, we’re becoming the SoC within the systems. There is a - there is still an economic sort of spectrum and it will always exist. If there is high enough volume, it will make sense to do in ASIC, or it will make sense to do in ASSP, because where the expense to develop that chip is very, very high these days. You can’t achieve a return on investment if you ship again to applications 5 million units or higher per year. But if you’re in applications that are below that, it’s very difficult, if not impossible to achieve the return on investment with that very large investment you make developing the chip, whereas we can develop one chip, sell it to many customers who again don’t have that sort of volume, but through the aggregation of the volume get the payback at the ROI necessary for us to continue to go forward. So we now are in essence the default SoC for all of those applications that ship in the few units per year all the way up to the low millions of units per year. Anil Doradla Great. And now if you step back and remove yourself from the recent volatility and uncertainty, have you changed your opinion on the long-term growth rate of FPGAs. What do you think in the long-term growth rate of this industry going forward? John Daane So our expectation for Altera is the high-single digits to low-double digits in terms of growth. And I’m sort of benchmarking the FPGA through the overall semiconductor industry on 4% to 5% compound annual growth in us roughly to expect perhaps slightly better with us some of our new markets, such as server acceleration, some of the IoT space, as well as automotive. Thank you for very much. Anil Doradla So that’s not changed. John Daane No but there’s - I would say two years ago, if you were to talk to us as an example about computer, we said maybe. And we were talking about it’s a potential, but we’re not quite sure, because we had to develop at a completely new software base. So that’s an area for us that I would say today is completely new. I would say automotive, you know five years ago, we would say, that’s a potential, but we’re not sure. That’s an area that our industry is seeing good growth. So I think that’s all beneficial, because it will allow the FPGA industry to expand beyond just communications where obviously we have a lot of revenue be able to diversify. But I think there are a lot of new growth markets and opportunities for us which should allow us to continue to grow to exceed overall industry. Again, thank you, Anil. Next, or I guess we’ve done. So, Scott? Scott Wylie Correct. Listen, as we wrap up this call today, let me mention the conferences that we will be attending this quarter. First, we will attend the Baird Growth Conference in Chicago on May 6. And in June on the second, we’ll present at the Bank of America Global Technology Conference in San Francisco. This concludes Altera’s earnings conference call. Thank you for your interest and participation. Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

[Operator Instructions] And we’ll go ahead and take our first question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joe Moore Great, thank you. I guess the question 99% of people asking you won’t be able to answer. So I’ll focus on a couple of other things. You had said that you would make the 10-nanometer decision by the end of the first quarter. Is there any update for us on that? John Daane Yeah, Joe, 10-nanometer I did say we would make a decision by the end of this quarter, or excuse me, in the end of Q1. We have not. It’s a complex decision. Maybe I should just kind of walk through some of the complexity behind it so you understand where we are. Traditionally Altera has had very few manufacturing partners, and we have had deep partnerships with those companies. And that has afforded us I think a lot of value. When we looked at other foundries outside of TSMC, that have been our long partner, of course we wanted to preserve a lot of the benefits that we had seen through the TSMC agreement. So there are three basic factors that I would say we evaluate when we select a foundry partner. One is the technology roadmap obviously, did they have the technology capabilities that we need and will they make some customization of that. Number two, the service and support, very critical for what we need. And then the third item, of course, is the commercial terms, which includes pricing and yield. In general I would say, we’re very comfortable with the technology roadmaps of both Intel and TSMC. And then on the service and support side, I would say as a pure-play foundry and obviously again as a longtime partner we’re very comfortable with TSMC’s service and support. Intel, since they are new to being a pure-play foundry or new to the foundry industry in general, we decided to negotiate a contract to put in a lot of the important elements into the contract to make sure that we got things that we needed. And we ended up I think publishing that contract online in April of 2013. And that includes, just again to kind of go back over to a couple different items that we talked about in the past. One is we manufacture for longer than normal companies, because of some of our customers a very long tails like industrial, military, and to some extent telecom, and so Intel agreed to 12 year manufacturing. We want to make sure that we get the focus and support from the foundry which we’ve always traditionally gotten. Therefore, we do not want to compete with our foundry and we agreed that Intel would not invest in, develop their own product line or buy a PLD company or buy another PLD company. We agreed in that contract that as an example that we would be the only major FPGA company to have access to 14-nanometer. So there were a lot of things that we’ve done that make us now feel very comfortable about the service and support elements of Intel. And then the third gets down to again the commercial side and I would say that has become a little bit more complex recently. And so we’re spending a little bit more time to review that and make sure that we make the right decision. So we haven’t made the vendor selection yet, for 10 still open and still having discussions. Joe Moore Okay. And if I could just follow up on that, when you say the commercial side, I guess, what specifically is the complication there or the issue that still needs to be hashed out? John Daane Commercial gets down into pricing and yield. Yield is an easy function in terms of yield projections that you get from the foundries; pricing and other commercial terms of the areas that are still under discussion, Joe. Joe Moore Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. John Daane Thank you very much. Next question, please. Operator Next question comes from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. Hans Mosesmann Thank you. I have - I didn’t expect to come here so early a bit. My question, John, is on the datacenter side or the acceleration market. When you say that with Microsoft deploying in their Bing search your FPGAs, they are able to reduce the number of servers in half. What is the total upfront cost relative to the solution that you’re displacing. John Daane I think that the feedback that we’ve had is that our solution is much more cost-effective than GPUs, both because the total solution of the FPGA is lower from a cost of component plus heat-sink, also the power is an order of magnitude lower. And as you know Hans the power is the number one spend in a datacenter. Compared to a processor what we’ve heard is pricing is similar and again the advantage of using the FPGA is it will accelerate mathematics algorithms. Microsoft has put out all this data and I think continues to put out a lot of data on the value of FPGAs beyond search. So they looked at many other areas and many other applications within their company. IBM has also put out some similar statistics where they’ve - for their POWER8 series using our FPGAs and announced that for many applications it reduces the number of servers required as well. Hans Mosesmann Okay. Thanks and as a quick follow-up can you give us a sense of the investment in the compiler technology to get an FPGA to work practically in acceleration. How much time and effort or investment is required? Thanks. John Daane It took us several years of development to develop a compiler from OpenCL. It’s also an investment in hardware accelerator blocks that we developed for our library that customers can access and it will continue to be a very significant investment for us to open up the market. Now, it’s not just for a cloud or big data analytics. It also works for a series of other markets. We’ve seen that the military market and high-performance computing has been very interested in OpenCL as a compiler. We’ve also had other markets including medical and computer peripherals such as high-end printers. They’ve also been interested and are using OpenCL from us. So it was a technology originally we developed to access the server space, but is applicable to a broader market segment and where we broadly rolled that technology out. Hans Mosesmann Thank you. John Daane Thank you very much, Hans. Next question, please. Operator Next question comes from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse. John Pitzer Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. Thanks for letting me ask the question. John, just help me understand why you’re comfortable you’re going to see sequential growth in the September quarter, specifically in the telecom and wireless space. You’re down to sort of revenue levels, if I’m doing the math right in the June quarter that we haven’t seen since really the post-3G kind of fall off. And then, if you look at sort of this LTE cycle, which hasn’t been nearly as robust as a 3G cycle. So as you mentioned in your opening comments we’re kind of in the perfect storm. How do you think we got here? And why are you confident that Q3 will be a resumption of sequential growth. John Daane Okay, John, let me give some more color on wireless, because I think that’s the primary driver of this. As I mentioned, the slowdown that we see is across several geographies and it’s rare that we do see a slowdown across multiple major geographies. But certainly Japan, U.S. and now China are soft and each is a little bit different. And in Japan and China, we’ve seen some aggressive pricing rolled out because of competition and therefore we’ve seen some of the carriers adjust their CapEx budgets in order to improve their P&L. We have seen this phenomenon in the past, particularly out of Japan and what has happened is extended to be a 3 month to 6 month adjustment in terms of carrier spending before they start to return or resume to what was their normal life level. Additionally, in the United States the spectrum auctions that have been ongoing cause some of the carriers to limit capital in the short run, so that they could improve their cash positions to be able to pay for the spectrum. I think that will play through fairly quickly this year and we’ll see a return in the back-half of the year and probably both Japan and the U.S. More importantly to this is China. And I think if you look at China the explanation, I don’t think it’s well out there, but it’s pretty simple. That is a China has now, where it’s now going through an audit of their state-owned enterprises. So this has been something that’s been publicly released. And what we’re seeing as the carriers are going through this audit, they’re basically shutting down or severely limiting how much capital or how many orders that they put out for this given period of time. And so that’s what’s causing the very significant slowdown in China for 3G as well as 4G deployments, but predominantly 4G. Now in particular, we don’t think that this is going to last for a long period of time. China Unicom actually has already gone through their audit. Right now telecom and mobile are in their audit. And what we hear and what we expect both from our customers as well as in discussion with carriers is that they’re expecting calendar quarter Q3-Q4 that the business will pick back up as they have completed that audit phase. Importantly, this is not related to for us any design loss or any market share loss. It’s simply the way in deployments and again we expect to pick up in the back-half of the year. And I think you’re hearing similar announcements from other semiconductor companies. I think yesterday, Xilinx and the Texas Instruments for example said that they saw similar down ticks in the wireless industry in particular. Now unfortunately, wireless has proven to be volatile for the PLD industry and probably more particularly for Altera, because we have a larger business base in wireless and it’s a larger percentage of our company’s revenues, then the PLD and for that matter I think anybody else. And if you just go back in time, you can see the - so Scott pulled some data going back over the last six years looking at the last 24 quarters. And what you find is in the last 24 quarters 13 of them we either - our wireless business either went up or down sequentially more than 10%. And in eight of those quarters were one-third at that period of time it was up or down more than 20% sequentially. So we’ve seen the wireless volatility. Historically, it’s been tied to sometimes geographies turn on or turn off, sometimes it’s multiple geographies getting together. And again based on what we’re hearing from our customers as well as the operators, we do expect that this is temporary and the business is going to pick up starting significantly in the third calendar quarter. John Pitzer That’s helpful, John. Then quickly, it’s my follow up. Ron, I want to make sure I heard you correct on the gross margin line. Did you say that you expect to see continued sequential growth after the June quarter in gross margins and just given the mix shift back to wireless, which is usually a lower gross margin product? Is there other - what’s your takes on the gross margin line that can allow you to continue to rise throughout the year? Ronald Pasek Yeah, John, this is consistent with what I said on our December 10 call, when I laid out the plan then what we’d expect to see for gross margin through the year in our call last quarter as well. And there are other factors besides mix, mix is the dominant one, but there are other obviously elements to the cost side and the price side. So, yes, it should continue to increase throughout the year. John Pitzer Thank you. That’s helpful, guys. I appreciate it. John Daane Thank you very much, John. Next question, please. Operator Next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Unidentified Analyst This is Steve for Tristan. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is on gross margin. What is the gross margin differential for you between 20-nanometer and 28-nanometer, and getting up back to a single architecture at the 20-nanometer? John Daane Honestly between nodes the gross margin is not that different. I wouldn’t expect over the long-term to see any significant difference by node. As you just heard previously generally because of volume in different end markets where gross margin is a function of vertical market mix. So obviously customers that buy more, get better pricing, that tends to be then the biggest driver of gross margin variance. Unidentified Analyst All right. Thank you. That’s helpful. And my second question is related to 28-nanometer. If 28 is the longest node for FPGA so far, could you just maybe talk a little bit about the ramification of the slowdown on your capital structure? And do you slowdown CapEx going forward in order to maintain your ROI? John Daane Well, I think we have to realize we are a fabulous company. So we do not invest in manufacturing equipment. Capital for us is computers and software predominantly EDA Software that we would lease in order to develop our chip. So we would not adjust based on node or volume of any particular node. In general, I’m not sure 28-nanometer is necessarily going to be the longest live node in PLD industry’s history. I don’t think there is going to be any different from any other node. Typically, from introduction, we see a peak five-year, six-year, seven-year, and then at tail last few years afterwards. And I think 28-nanometer will be the same as any other node for us. So, yes, doesn’t change what we are doing or how we are investing as a company. Unidentified Analyst All right. Thank you. John Daane Thank you very much. Next question, please? Operator Next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Unidentified Analyst Hi. Thank you for taking my question. This is Julie [ph] for Ross Seymore. Can you give some additional color on why the industrial military auto segment was down double-digits in the March quarter? And given the weakness, how should we think about the growth for this segment in 2015? John Daane So what was down in the calendar quarter Q1 and we actually did or predict us when we had our call for Q4 is, industrial was down and military was down. Military is typically down in the first calendar quarter, that has to do with seasonality or spend of government budgets, and so that’s what we saw. Military is pulling back up this quarter and is going to grow substantially, again on a normal season pattern. Industrial was oddly down in the first calendar quarter and that is not usual. We would have expected it to perform better. I think what we were seeing is some adjustment by companies as they were adjusting in Europe and Japan to the stronger dollar. Ultimately though, we were able to call that correction for the quarter, it did happen. And overall, we are expecting that industrial will grow for us double-digit sequentially this quarter, so it’s really roaring back. And those were the two main impacts, overall, automotive was up in the quarter. Unidentified Analyst Okay. Thank you. And given the lower revenue growth profile for the year, how should we think about OpEx guidance that was given previously, any changes? Ronald Pasek No, with the exception of the - of foreign exchange benefit that we predict given the strong dollar if it continues $10 million to $13 million, I’m not changing the full-year OpEx at this point. John Daane Thank you very much. Next question, please? Operator Our next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. James Covello Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. Going back to Joe Moore’s first question on the 10-nanometer decision, is it a two-horse race for the foundry decision, or could there be more players potentially involved? John Daane Right now, it’s a two-horse race. James Covello Okay. Thank you. And then going back to Hans’s question on the accelerator market, could you walk us through a timeframe, where that could potentially become a meaningful portion of the quarterly revenue? What do you think a reasonable sign post would be for us to think about the FPGA accelerator market, representing something that say you might have to breakout separately? John Daane I think if you sort of look at all of our vertical markets in general, we expect very broad-based growth across all. We do expect the computer, industrial, and automotive will likely be for the next several years, as we’ve discussed in the past, the fastest growing. But because we expect growth from all of our vertical markets, we’re not necessarily expecting that there will be a dramatic shift in the next year or two. In general, the opportunity for us in servers is very, very large, and we put out the $1 billion opportunity in the past you’re seeing in Nvidia how strong growth in this area. We think we have a more compelling product just simply because of the performance and power benefit, so we have over GPUs, and it’s a new space. Overall, I’d say computer is probably for us about, I don’t know how to break it out, I was going to say maybe 8% of revenue overall. So you can tell that it’s already become significant for us. We expect that this area probably will grow 20% to 30% compound annual and maybe that gives you sort of some metrics to use in terms of thoughts of how it’s going to grow. Certainly, it’s a great opportunity. We talked about Microsoft. We talked about IBM, but there are a lot more customers that we’re working with right now that are deploying or are doing the development right now and plan to deploy over the next couple of years. So I think we’ve gone from this being a concept to now being a reality and growing quite well for us. James Covello Incredibly helpful. Thanks a lot. Good luck. John Daane Okay. Thank you very much. Next question, please? Operator Next question comes from Doug Freedman with RBC. Doug Freedman Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess, if I could start in on one of your - your main competitor talked about a slower ramp in their 28-nanometer product portfolio than they might have expected a year ago. What are you guys seeing on that front? And can give us a guidepost on where your 28-nanometer finished the quarter? John Daane I am not familiar with what they may have said. So unfortunately, I’m not in a position to be able to comment at all on slow growth. I think in general, 28-nanometer has done very well. Overall, we ended the year roughly at about 40% market share, and we ended the quarter also at about 48% market - or 40%, excuse me, the market share as well for 28-nanometer. Our overall market share as a company is for FPGAs versus our larger competitor is about 38%. So the fact that we’re doing that well in 40 and for that matter, the several nodes before that says that in general we should expect to take market share over the years to come. So that - hopefully, that answers and gives a little color on 28-nanometer. Doug Freedman Okay. If I could you had talked about your 14-nanometer progress. Can you give us an update on where that stands in effect just sort of walk one more on the OpEx side. Are there any advisor fees in the numbers that you’ve guided to? John Daane So for me on 14-nanometer there’s no change. We plan to sample in the fall of this year. Doug Freedman Great. Thank you. John Daane Thank you very much. Another question or next question, please? Operator Next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities. Srini Pajjuri Thank you. John, given the volatility in the business, how should we think about a normalized run rate for your - in a quarterly revenues? And then whatever that is, do you expect to get there in the second-half, I know, you talked about recovering the second-half of this year? And then also I’m thinking, I’m looking at your operating margins, they’ve been in the mid-20s for a while and then probably going to low-20s, I know you have a higher target longer-term. But on a normalized basis, how do we get up this mid-20 or low-20 operating margin in the model? John Daane Well, to answer it backwards, I think if you look at the model the way that we are able to move back into the low-30s operating margin, which is our target is, we are constraining expenses moving forward. So this year, last year, and the years going forward, we want to basically keep our expenses, SG&A and R&D flat plus or minus a couple percent and you’ve seen us do that. Second element is, we’ve been operating last year with lower gross margins than we think are where the company should operate. We think we’re more in the 67% margin on average level. You’re seeing the expansion of our gross margins now, both which are because of mix, but it also because of continuing cost containment and operating costs improvements that we make and we’ll continue to make as a corporation. So that will help the op margin side. And then the third element is, overall, you’ll get the revenue growth and coupled with high gross margins that will flow down very, very well to the bottom line. So that’s the thesis you’ve seen us from the past from us. I think if you look at 2008 versus 2010 or 2011, you saw a lot of op margin expansion as we had revenue growth. And I do think we have a lot of revenue opportunity in a lot of markets. The other element that you asked, it’s, we’ve commented before. It’s very difficult to predict seasonality in our particular industry. So I can’t give you the - what would be a normal growth rate for a particular quarter. In terms of what will wireless do in Q3 or Q4, we don’t have enough visibility to be able to point out exactly what the number will be. We know we will grow in Q3. We know, because we will grow in wireless, so the overall company will grow. Overall, will wireless get back to the levels in Q1 or Q4? We don’t have that sort of visibility right now. But we know it’s going to come back strongly, and we do anticipate, we’ll get strong company growth in the third calendar quarter from that. Srini Pajjuri Okay, great. That’s helpful. And then I understand you don’t want to discuss the speculation out there. But my question is assuming hypothetically if there was an offer on the table, can you talk about some of the factors that you would look at to whether to accept and offer or reject an offer? John Daane So as Scott said earlier, our policy is not to comment on rumors or hypothetical M&A transactions or hypothetical elements or may or may not happen within our particular industry. All I guess I would say is a - I took a step back is that, our board fully understands its fiduciary responsibility. We are intent on enhancing shareholder value, and we are agnostic as to the path to get there. Srini Pajjuri Thank you. John Daane Thank you very much. Next question, please? Operator Next question comes from Ruben Roy with Piper Jaffray. Ruben Roy Thank you. John, you’d mentioned a bit on around your discussion of the China base station market, some pressure and some reallocation of CapEx given perhaps the rate of subscriber adds or something like that. And I was wondering in terms of your design activity, which I assume is ongoing despite the order pause. Have you seen anything, that would indicate that we might see some pricing pressure in the base station market, as you look out maybe in the second-half of this year into 2016? John Daane Base stations tend not to change that often. And so you’re typically seeing an architectural shift for our customers on a two-year to four-year cycle on base stations just because of the complexity of the systems. Radios, of course, there are so many frequencies and there are so many different features in radios. Many of the vendors are developing 60 to 100 different radios a year. So there’s more opportunity for products cost reductions or product replacements just to give you an idea of the cycle. Overall, I would say, there’s really no difference or change in market pressure in terms of pricing today for products as they were as it was a year ago or two years ago. Customers obviously would like more features at a lower price. We try to design that through new generations of technology and hopefully, if we get that right, we’ll continue to grow as a company. Ruben Roy That’s helpful, John. I guess just as a follow-up then, is there interest in the base station - in baseband specifically, area of the base station market for 14-nanometer technology. And if so when do you think you might start shipping some of those devices into the platforms? John Daane We will have, as an example, we’ll have base station shipping on 20-nanometer products from Altera this year. Those have been in design for a couple of years now. I think what you’re going to see is 14-nanometer if I were to guess. 2017, perhaps, you’ll see companies entering into production using our own 14-nanometer FPGAs at that time. Ruben Roy Great. Thanks, John. John Daane For base stations. Thank you very much. Next question, please? Operator Next question comes from Christopher Rolland with FBR Capital Markets. Unidentified Analyst Hey, guys. This is Joe on for Chris. Thanks. Let me ask the question. I was just curious what you guy’s overall thoughts were on moving towards the lower end of the market. Do you think Altera to have a replace in the mobile handsets or consumer products group? John Daane Joe, our focus is not to go after battery-operated appliances or applications. It really requires you to develop and different process type and you develop different architectures from what we have today. So where we have done some lower power products and where we do have low-end FPGAs and CPLDs that address a broad range of applications. Today, we’re not targeted in general on areas like handsets or tablets. Unidentified Analyst Okay, great, thanks. And then as a follow-up, I was intrigued by your wireless spectrum comments earlier. Do you think and you said you’re pretty comfortable there. What gives you comfort that’s a short-term phenomenon, and do you think that will impact on your emerging markets going forward, could we see an environment where all around we’ll see lower CapEx lowered going forward? John Daane Well, I think probably CapEx does not get lower going forward. I think it’s been fairly consistent for a long period of time. What is a little bit confusing in the CapEx numbers is, there’s - in the U.S. and in the U.S. accounting system, the carriers in the U.S. can include a lot of elements that are not what we would traditionally think of capital. So they can include labor. They can include consulting. They can include software. So it’s many times I think for people that are getting data maybe confusing as to what’s actually happening. We do see fluctuations where some quarters are stronger than others. But in general, if you look at the market, there is still need to build out capacity for 4G and 3G throughout the world, and there is a very strong push towards 5G in particular, because what’s happening as you can see with the U.S. there’s a number of carriers are ending up with spectrum that is not contiguous. And therefore they need to manage this and string it together. And so they’re going to need the newer radio styles that are going to come with 4.5G, 5G, which will require all new equipment deployments in order to take advantage of all this new spectrum that they are buying and to more efficiently use the spectrum that they already have. And so in general, I think there’s going to be a continued need to see further spends on wireless and wireline for many years to come. Unidentified Analyst Great. Thank you. John Daane Thank you very much. Next question, please? Operator Next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya Thanks for taking my question. John, one more on wireless especially in China. Are you seeing any excess inventory or base stations or base stations that were pre-built or any move towards smaller cells. I’m just trying to understand whether this overhang on FPGA demand, will it persist even when Telco CapEx is relieved just because it happens to be pre-built base stations or whether carriers because of capacity needs start moving more towards smaller cells? John Daane So for that in China, in particular, the answer is, yes, some of the existing products that our customers have, they will use to ship as the audits are completed, which is why we’re seeing the very significant downtick. In other words, where customers lined up doing is using this as an opportunity or time that they will bleed off the inventory and then start to return to orders from us in the third calendar quarter as those carriers, the two that are left complete their overall audits. And so that is factored into this big dip that we’re seeing in both like Q1 and Q2 in our wireless business and ultimately where we expected to spring back. So that idea of that some of our customers who have inventory has already been factored in. In terms of small cells, we do have content in small cells, and what has now come back is a change in forecast and that, there will be far fewer small cells deployed in China than previously thought. The carriers there are just not as interested in the technology. So that in particular is not going to ship in the volumes that we’re projected late last year or even earlier this year, does not have a tremendous impact to us, because we have far more dollar content, and the macro base stations and obviously the radios themselves. Vivek Arya Very helpful. And then as my follow-up, Ron, could you remind us again what’s causing the gross margins to be so much different than your competitor who was putting up 69%, 70% gross margin, because I think historically, you have always outperformed then. So what’s causing this pressure now and what can help to close the gap over the next few quarters? Thank you. Ronald Pasek Yes, thanks for the question. So there’s three things that really causing this in my opinion. Number one is, our competitor has a Last Time Buy that’s been going on for probably well over 2.5 years, we do not have such a Last Time Buy. They do about twice the amount of militarily business we do, which is obviously one of the higher gross margin verticals. And as I said last quarter, we have two 10% customers. We had two 10% customers last year, they have zero. So all things being equal, those put a little more pressure on gross margin, because they do higher volumes. John Daane And they particularly are more oriented towards the wireless business, which we’ve mentioned many times as lower gross margin. However do take a step back and I think we have to congratulate them for the fact that they are operating extremely well and give them credit for that as well. Vivek Arya Thank you. John Daane Thank you very much. Next question, please? Operator Next question comes from any Chris Danely with Citi. Chris Danely Yes, thanks, guys. I guess just a follow-up on the last question from Vivek on the gross margin. So quick clarification, do you have two 10% customers this quarter, and then you talk about your higher gross margin markets have underperformed, and your mixes in wireless is lower. Is there any sort of taking a step back, is there any sort of common driver there? And I guess, can you just give us some confidence that this is going to stop, and I know you talked some sort of non-mix ways you can improve margins and maybe elaborate on those? Ronald Pasek Yes, so consistent with what I side when we articulated plan in December of last year some of the higher margin verticals for the year are going to be the primary growth verticals for us, and that’s what you’re seeing mainly from Q1 to Q2 and it’s going to continue as the year progresses. John Daane I think if you step back to last year as an example our gross margins did go down. The two verticals for us are sub-verticals that had the strongest growth and far out performed their plan, our plan for them, were wireless and consumer as we mentioned before. And again those were two of the lower gross margin verticals, simply because of the volume that is in those areas. The reason that we had said that gross margins will grow this year is because we expect strong growth out of computer, out of industrial, out of military as examples, and those are all some of our higher gross margin verticals. So mix obviously is better this year. We continue to do cost reductions work on yields, work on material cost reductions, work on continuing to improve design efficiencies, so that we can lower our costs, those are ongoing efforts that we will do certainly every year. And then to your other question, Chris, we will not or we do not expect to have any 10% customers this quarter. Again, as you can imagine our two 10% customers coming out of last year are very heavily focused on wireless and so they’re going to be impacted for us this quarter and therefore we do not anticipate we’re going to have any 10% customers this quarter. Chris Danely Great, thanks. And for my follow-up just a quick on 10-nanometer, do you expect to make a decision on at this quarter? I guess, why would you be hesitating on speaking with Intel? You made this big switch from Taiwan Semi over to Intel. Has something changed there? Has anything like stretched out or change, I guess, why would you be hesitating and what would be involved in switching back to TSMC at 10-nanometer? John Daane So we use third-party tools and we use libraries that come from third-parties and memory cells that come from foundries or third-parties. So it requires infrastructure switch, but since we are currently doing development with both TSMC and Intel today, we could easily switch back and forth between the two, because we’ve got the knowledge and we’ve got the skill-set. And we’ve got all the technology. Adding a third foundry would be a lot of work for us, because it would be all new learning. So because again we’re doing the 20-nanometer technology development with TSMC, we completed a 55-nanometer embedded flash family with TSMC. That relationship is ongoing and is going currently. So we are doing development with both companies. We feel very comfortable with their technology roadmaps as I mentioned. Service and support we’ve established and now it comes down to the commercial term side. So I do anticipate that that decision will be made this quarter, and they will be in a position when it comes to the call next time to let you know where we’re headed. Chris Danely Thanks. John Daane Thank you very much, Chris. Next question please? Operator [Operator Instructions] And we next move to Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple on, we talked a lot about wireless, on wireline you had a reset in December. You’re expecting to come back nicely. Is that going to be out for you in Q2, do you still expect that rebound? And then maybe for the big picture, I know you don’t want to talk about the deal, but just figuring out how to justify $50 or $60 stock price, you need to get at least back to your peak earnings number. With this reset you’re back down, run rate is closer to $1. When you look at PLD industry, the 10% growth, you see a lot of companies resetting growth profiles, thinking about different cost structures. Is that something that you’re looking at or do you still think that PLDs could grow at that rate? John Daane I still think that - and our expectation is for Altera that we should outgrow the overall industry by about 2X. Overall, our expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenue as our revenues grow and that’s something that we have communicated in the model. We expect that we would grow from where we are today in the low 20s in terms op margin to the low 30s, which is our long-term target. We think during that period of time there’s a lot of expansion not only of op margin, but we would expect also from a stock-price perspective, because of the EPS growth. Add to that, we are continuing to work on cash return to shareholders through dividend and the share repurchase even though it’s currently suspended has been very accretive for us as well. And we will continue to focus on cash return to shareholders as much as possible. In terms of telecom I have said in Q4 that for Q1 we expect telecom to be flat. It was slightly down. I think it was down about 2%. So it was roughly flat. The forecast is for it to grow this quarter. I’m kind of hedging that a little bit and I’m thinking that maybe that flips out Q3. So remember in Ron’s opening remarks that he did say we were trying to be very conservative this quarter in terms of the guidance. And that’s one of the elements that we just said. Maybe we see telecom just continue to be flat for now and maybe grow in the back-half of the year. Blayne Curtis Okay. Thank you. John Daane Thank you very much. Next question, please. Operator Next question comes from Alex Gauna with JMP Securities. Alex Gauna Thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon, everybody. John, you’ve been around for at least [indiscernible] and we got a clean plate of all the [indiscernible] Xilinx, you, TI. It sure feels like [indiscernible] that might mean there isn’t [indiscernible]. What are your thoughts [indiscernible]. John Daane Thanks, Alex. I think we understood your question your sort of volume is low for us. I think overall, I don’t think that this is the end of the cycle. If you think of semiconductors, typically we’ve seen cycles driven by CapEx spend. So where you know sometimes there’s not enough CapEx spend, capacity drives up, prices go up, industry grows, lot of CapEx spend, too much volume is put in place, prices decline therefore the industry declines. I don’t think that’s the case today. We’re not seeing that CapEx is really run away from what the industry growth rates are and overall recently you have seen a couple of companies adjust their CapEx spending downwards. So I think that’s okay. Ultimately, I think some vertical markets are doing well and some vertical markets are under a little bit of pressure. We’re also susceptible to what’s happening on the macro, so if the macro were to substantially deteriorate, I think we would all be certainly impacted by that. But right now I think if it were not for this wireless delay that I mentioned we would be seeing sequential growth this quarter as well as gross margin expansion this quarter. Alex Gauna Okay, that’s helpful, and sorry about the volume on that last question. If we think about another aspect of what drives the Altera story, you believe for years that you can gain share versus ASIC and ASSP. And at least in the more recent periods here that does not seem to be the case for either you or your peer. What can you say about if that part of the thesis is still in place for you, and if so, why are we seeing that anomaly here in the near-term where a lot of the ASSP players still seem to be outperforming your performance. Thanks. John Daane Well, I think there are different markets, for instance some of the ASSP players have been tied to mobile handsets, we’re not in that particular market. So I think you have to take it a step back and look at particular verticals. And I think if you look at the verticals that we’re in we have been outperforming the semiconductor industry on average over a 3 year to 5 year basis point. In general, if you look at the ASIC market, I would say and go back five, six years ago it has changed substantially. Texas Instruments was at one time one of the top ASIC providers, they’re out. IBM is out having sold off their semiconductor group. It’s not evident to me that global foundries are necessarily carrying that strategy forward. We’ve seen the Japanese companies and many companies in Japan deemphasize ASIC entirely. So I think that industry has been under a lot of pressure as evidenced by the fact that many of the top providers in the top 10 have really exited the overall business, and to a large degree that’s been replaced by either ASSPs and handsets or FPGAs and the infrastructure equipment side. And I think there’s plenty of evidence on the ASIC front that PLDs continue to replace it and that economically really are customers have no choice but to use programmable logic going forward. Alex Gauna Okay. Thank you. Good luck on restoring the momentum. John Daane Thank you very much, Alex. Next question please? Operator Next question comes from Deepon Nag with Macquarie. Deepon Nag Yes. Thanks guys. Could you give us the gross margin for the acceleration business? When you think about the seasonality of that, is it seasonally strong in the back-half of the year relative to the first-half? John Daane So theoretically, if you were a player in the broad space within the computer industry and particularly servers, I would say that you typically do see Q4 stronger and then Q1 weaker in terms of a seasonal pattern. But today, we’re doing business with companies that build their own datacenters is an example and some others, IBM, as I mentioned and Hewlett-Packard. But in the case of companies that build their own data centers, so they are not on our clock, in other words, they will build out a datacenter based on their own clock, and so it’s a little bit different from that perspective. So we haven’t seen a lot of seasonality necessarily with our portion of the computer business, and again, it’s still very early innings in terms of what we can achieve. In terms of gross margins, I think computer in general has been at or above our overall corporate level. Deepon Nag Great, excellent. And on the foundry deal with Intel, how long has Intel compelled to not invest or develop alternative FPGA technologies, if you were to switch to [indiscernible] 10-nanometers? John Daane I think, again, I refer people probably and we have gotten a little bit of interest recently about this through the agreement that is online and for individuals to look at that particular agreement. I don’t know if there are dates establish with it, so I probably just end this by saying, we’re very comfortable with the protections that we negotiated in that agreement. Deepon Nag Got it. Thanks a lot. John Daane Thank you very much. Next question, please? Operator And our final question comes from Anil Doradla with William Blair. Anil Doradla Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in. John, couple of question, so back to that ASIC replacement thesis, when you open up a box today, there are fewer chips out there. So the whole system-on-a-chip is taking a lot more functionality, whether it’s input/output, more memory, processors, and so forth. So what would you say to perhaps some element of criticism that an amount of glue logic that you would need, the amount of FPGA you would need with the rights of SoCs diminishes. Do you think there’s any validity to that thesis? John Daane I think you are correct. In that there may be fewer chips, certainly than when I started where you had TTL logic with four gigs per chip. The number of raw chips is perhaps diminishing the system, and then you’re seeing more integrated SoC’s. And that’s exactly the reason why you’re seeing from us and from Xilinx as well the advents of SoC based PLDs or FPGAs. So if you kind of look at the FPGA evolution 15 years ago, we had only logic in our chips, we then added memory. We then added DSP blocks, which really took on and displaced a lot of what was the traditional DSP industry. We then added transceivers, which took on and replaced a lot of analog components. And mostly, recently, we’ve added microprocessors, so multi-core microprocessors to our FPGAs. So, in fact, we’re becoming the SoC within the systems. There is a - there is still an economic sort of spectrum and it will always exist. If there is high enough volume, it will make sense to do in ASIC, or it will make sense to do in ASSP, because where the expense to develop that chip is very, very high these days. You can’t achieve a return on investment if you ship again to applications 5 million units or higher per year. But if you’re in applications that are below that, it’s very difficult, if not impossible to achieve the return on investment with that very large investment you make developing the chip, whereas we can develop one chip, sell it to many customers who again don’t have that sort of volume, but through the aggregation of the volume get the payback at the ROI necessary for us to continue to go forward. So we now are in essence the default SoC for all of those applications that ship in the few units per year all the way up to the low millions of units per year. Anil Doradla Great. And now if you step back and remove yourself from the recent volatility and uncertainty, have you changed your opinion on the long-term growth rate of FPGAs. What do you think in the long-term growth rate of this industry going forward? John Daane So our expectation for Altera is the high-single digits to low-double digits in terms of growth. And I’m sort of benchmarking the FPGA through the overall semiconductor industry on 4% to 5% compound annual growth in us roughly to expect perhaps slightly better with us some of our new markets, such as server acceleration, some of the IoT space, as well as automotive. Thank you for very much. Anil Doradla So that’s not changed. John Daane No but there’s - I would say two years ago, if you were to talk to us as an example about computer, we said maybe. And we were talking about it’s a potential, but we’re not quite sure, because we had to develop at a completely new software base. So that’s an area for us that I would say today is completely new. I would say automotive, you know five years ago, we would say, that’s a potential, but we’re not sure. That’s an area that our industry is seeing good growth. So I think that’s all beneficial, because it will allow the FPGA industry to expand beyond just communications where obviously we have a lot of revenue be able to diversify. But I think there are a lot of new growth markets and opportunities for us which should allow us to continue to grow to exceed overall industry. Again, thank you, Anil. Next, or I guess we’ve done. So, Scott? Scott Wylie Correct. Listen, as we wrap up this call today, let me mention the conferences that we will be attending this quarter. First, we will attend the Baird Growth Conference in Chicago on May 6. And in June on the second, we’ll present at the Bank of America Global Technology Conference in San Francisco. This concludes Altera’s earnings conference call. Thank you for your interest and participation. Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson. Gary Dickerson Thanks, Mike. I'm very happy to report another record-breaking quarter for Applied Materials with the highest revenue and earnings in our history. We've now set earnings records for 4 quarters in a row and as I look across the company, I see tremendous momentum. Our markets are strong and getting stronger and we're sustainably growing faster than these markets by expanding our served opportunity and gaining share. In today's call, I will provide our perspective on the factors driving the industry and our strategy for sustainable, profitable growth within this environment. I will then describe the key inflections and investments within our markets before concluding with updates on our major businesses. Bob will then provide additional detail about our performance and outlook. Let me start with the big picture. This is an incredibly exciting period for the electronics industry, with a broader set of drivers and a wider spectrum of companies making very large investments to advance semiconductor and display technology. In the past, PCs were the dominant factor in semiconductor demand. PCs drove the technology road map and enterprise refresh cycles drove industry upturns and downturns. More recently, global adoption of smartphones, combined with social media, have created a much more pervasive consumer demand, expanding the market and making it substantially less cyclical. Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. The impact for Applied is twofold. First, our markets are growing and becoming more stable. Second, this is a period of incredible innovation in logic, memory and display and we're in a great position to provide the critical building blocks needed to move the industry forward. At Applied, our strategy is to be the innovation leader in markets that are evolving faster than ever before. To do that, we fueled innovation by reallocating resources and significantly increasing our investment in new product development. Then, to drive repeatable success and accelerate the pace of learning, we've developed a unique operating system, our product development engine and trained more than 10,000 employees how to use it. Across the organization, we're focused on delivering highly differentiated products and services that enable customers to build new devices and structures that were never possible before. I believe our innovation leadership is sustainable because of the breadth and depth of our capabilities. Our ability to combine unique competencies, technology and intellectual property accelerates our innovation process and sets us apart from competitors. Having provided this context, I'll now describe the major inflections and investments taking place within our markets. Sales of memory chips are at record levels, fueled by increasing content in smartphones to support better cameras and VR applications as well as the need for more and higher performance storage in data centers. Market fundamentals remain strong and as a result, we're seeing robust investment from our memory customers. We believe we will see double-digit growth in DRAM spending this year and we expect NAND investment to be even stronger. Our view of 2018 and beyond is also positive for a number of reasons. The explosion of data storage requirements created by IoT, big data, AI and streaming video has only just begun. Data generation from new categories, such as Industry 4.0 and autonomous vehicles, can potentially dwarf existing applications within a few years. As 3D NAND bit density increases and cost per bit falls, new segments of the storage market are opening up for solid-state drives. And at the same time, the bit density increase from generation to generation is slower for 3D than it was for planar NAND. To compensate, the industry needs more wafer starts and greenfield capacity. In foundry, we're also seeing an acceleration of investment, both at the leading edge and in trailing geometries. In 2017, we expect investment in new leading edge capacity to make up about 60% of total foundry spending. This is driven by demand for more sophisticated smartphone processors as well as customers positioning to win the major inflections in high-performance computing and data centers that are needed to start unlocking the potential of AI. Within foundry, logic and DRAM, I'm increasingly excited about our opportunities in patterning. As these customers move to smaller chip geometries, all the layers in the device scale. A limited number of layers will move to EUV, but significantly more will move to multi-patterning. This means our patterning opportunity will expand considerably over the coming years. Applied is making significant investments to enable the patterning road map. We've already increased our patterning revenues more than 60% in the past year and still have significant room to grow. Taking all these factors into consideration, we now believe that wafer fab equipment spending for the calendar year could be up about 15% relative to 2016 and our outlook for 2018 and beyond remains positive. Our expectations for the display market also continue to strengthen as a result of large inflections in both TV and mobile screen technology. Average TV sizes are expected to reach 44.5 inches in 2017, up 5 inches in the past 3 years. One of the key factors driving this growth is demand for large-format TVs, 60 inches and above. As customers optimize factories for these bigger screen sizes, they are investing in new Gen 10.5 capacity. In parallel, we see investment in mobile OLED getting stronger as confidence in the adoption rates of OLED technology increases. Recent forecasts indicate that 2/3 of new smartphones could have OLED displays by 2021 and screen manufacturers are accelerating their investment plans accordingly. My final comments about the market environment relate to China which is an important long term growth opportunity for Applied. We believe 2017 spending will be slightly higher than last year. And based on the projects we're tracking, we expect to see a significant and steady investment ramp in both semiconductor and display beginning in 2018. I'll now provide updates on the performance and priorities for our major business groups. Overall, Applied gained 2 points of wafer fab equipment share in 2016 and based on the strength of our product portfolio, I believe we'll add to those gains over the next several years. In our leadership businesses, such as PVD, epi, implant and thermal processing, where we have strong share and highly differentiated products, we're extending our advantage. The available market for our leadership products is also growing, specifically in PVD and CMP. In PVD, we expect our available market to expand by more than 30% in 2017 as foundry customers adopt new interconnect technology for lower power devices. And the CMP market grew 40% in 2016 and is on track to grow another 20% this year, primarily driven by increasing steps in 3D NAND. In our high-growth businesses, we're also outperforming our competitors in markets that are growing rapidly. In 2016, we gained about 5 points of share in conductor etch and 2 points in etch overall. This means that since 2012, we've won nearly 20 points of conductor share and 10 points of total etch share. These gains are driven by enabling technologies, like Sym3 and selective etch and new process steps. Our CVD business is also outpacing the market, gaining almost 6 points of market share in 2016. We have great momentum in these businesses and plenty of headroom to grow. Service represents a stable and growing revenue stream for the company. On a year-on-year basis, we've now grown service revenues for 14 consecutive quarters and our compound rate of growth has been around 10% over the past 4 years. Our expanding portfolio of service solutions plays an increasingly important role for customers, helping them compress ramp times, improving device performance and yield and optimize output and operating costs. Because of this, I'm confident that we can continue to grow service at a similar pace. Another exciting growth opportunity for Applied is display. Since 2012, we've grown display revenues around 20% per year and we have great momentum. This year, we're on track to book more than $2 billion of orders. Display technology and manufacturing is becoming increasingly complex and Applied is in a unique position to enable the road map. By leveraging our semiconductor experience and capabilities, we're delivering the innovative products our customers need to accelerate major technology transitions. Before I hand the call over to Bob, let me quickly summarize. Q2 was another record-breaking quarter and 2017 is shaping up to be an outstanding year for Applied. Our markets are becoming even more attractive. They are growing sustainably and becoming less volatile. And Applied is playing a larger and more valuable role advancing the innovation road map. We have focused our strategy and investments to ensure that Applied is the innovation leader that consistently delivers highly differentiated products and services. As a result, we're raising the ceiling for our performance and potential. We're setting new records, growing our available market and gaining market share. Now let me hand the call over to Bob. Robert Halliday Thanks, Gary. Before going into the details of the quarter, I'll touch on 3 things that are sustainably better for Applied, one, our markets; two, our improving position in those markets which is enabling stronger gross margin performance; and three, our profitability and free cash flow. First, our markets are more attractive. We believe wafer fab equipment spending will be higher and less volatile for the foreseeable future. Display equipment spending also looks higher and more attractive, for Applied Materials in particular, because we're greatly increasing our served addressable market. Many of you have added valuable insights as to why WFE has become larger and less volatile. I believe it boils down to three things, one, the semiconductor market is growing and becoming more diverse; two, equipment intensity is increasing; and three, capital investment is measured and rational. This better industry environment is sustainable. As Gary mentioned, the semiconductor industry we enable has also become larger, more diverse and more critical to big innovations in the global economy. Today, we're seeing the emergence of new silicon-rich devices needed to enable the Internet of Things, cloud data centers and artificial intelligence. Data is becoming more valuable and harnessing the value requires silicon. For Applied, this translates to higher demand for logic and memory capacity at both the leading edge and trailing geometries. I believe the industry has seen a new wave of sustainable growth with economic value creation that justifies the cost of investment. Next, Applied's position in the markets in sustainably stronger. The changes we've made since 2013 in strategy, capital allocation and business systems, like the product development engine, have given us our strongest product pipeline in many years. I've been invited to an industrials conference this month to explain how our products are enabling big changes in manufacturing that many people call Industry 4.0. Here is how I plan to summarize our contribution without going into all of the technology. Applied has a very strong overall business that can be separated into just 2 parts. First, we have our leadership semi equipment and services business which together generate nearly 60% of our revenue. Our leadership semi businesses drive technologies that are critical to making transistors for data processing and networking. We've maintained steady growth and high share positions averaging about 70% because we bring unique value to our customers. Our services business is similar in that it is highly enabling to our customers and characterized by steady, profitable growth. We're deeply engaged with our logic and foundry customers to enable their advanced road maps with this part of our business. When you think about the big new chips used for artificial intelligence, think of Applied Materials. Second, we have our high-growth businesses which include etch and deposition used in 3D NAND and multi-patterning, along with inspection and display. Our high-growth businesses now represent about 40% of our revenue. We've made outsized investments in new and disruptive products in these areas to capitalize on the inflections we identified in 2013. Our high-growth semi businesses have been growing 40% faster than their markets and Applied's unique display equipment business is growing even faster. Another way to measure Applied's stronger position in the markets is to consider the changes in our share by semiconductor device type. In 2012, our share in foundry was over 20%, but our share in logic, DRAM and NAND was under 15%. Today, we believe our share is at least 22% in all 4. In fact, we're the #1 equipment company by revenue in NAND, DRAM, logic and foundry. So regardless of the spending mix, applied is well positioned. A great measure of the strength of our products, the value they bring to our customers and our execution as a company is gross margin expansion. Since 2013, we have increased our gross margins in our semi, services and display segments across virtually every business unit. In 2017, I believe we will deliver company non-GAAP gross margin of about 46% which would be up by about 5 points versus 2012 and the company's best annual performance in a decade. Now I'll talk about how these changes are flowing through the income statement to enable stronger profitability and shareholder returns. Over the 2013 to 2016 period, we have grown the revenue line by 44%. When we compared 2017 to 2013, we can see revenue growth of 90%. This revenue growth demonstrates the compounding benefits of our share gains and new product penetrations across semi, services and display. For the year, we expect our top line growth, gross margin performance and disciplined R&D investment and spending to generate the highest non-GAAP operating margin of the past 17 years and free cash flow of 20% or more. The company has returned 100% of the free cash flow we generated over the past 5 years and stands committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. Next, I'll comment on our performance during Q2. As a reminder, we no longer report quarterly orders because we're focused on driving year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. Quarter-to quarter demand patterns can vary across our business. However, we have grown our revenue and non-GAAP EPS on a year-over-year basis in 14 of the past 15 quarters. In Q2, we grew company revenue by 45% year-over-year and increased non-GAAP gross margin by 3.6 points. Our non-GAAP operating expenses grew by only 14% over this period and we continue to invest 2/3 of OpEx in R&D to fuel our product development engine. We set new company records in profitability as we increased non-GAAP operating profit by 110% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share by 132% year-over-year. Now I'll compare our Q2 segment performance to the same period last year. We grew semiconductor systems revenue by 51% to $2.4 billion and non-GAAP operating margin by 9.7 points. We grew services revenue by 14% to a record $724 million and non-GAAP operating margin by 80 basis points. We more than doubled our display revenue to $391 million and increased non-GAAP operating margin by 4.9 points. Turning to the balance sheet. We grew cash from operations by 87% compared to the same period last year. We ended the quarter with $7.7 billion of cash and investments and nearly half was onshore. This increase includes proceeds from $2.2 billion in debt raised in March to increase onshore liquidity. Soon after the end of the quarter, we used approximately $200 million of the offering to redeem our October 2017 notes. We returned $390 million to shareholders in the quarter, paying $108 million in dividend and using $282 million to repurchase 7 million shares of stock at an average price of $38.15. Now I'll provide our third quarter guidance. We expect overall revenue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.75 billion. The midpoint would be up by 30% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, our semiconductor systems revenue should increase by about 41%. Services revenue should increase by about 13%. And display revenue should increase by about 27%. Non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately 46.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $665 million, plus or minus $10 million. Non-GAAP EPS should be in the range of $0.79 to $0.87, the midpoint of which would be up by 66% year-over-year. Finally, to help you with your models, we project revenue in Corporate and Other to be around $15 million. We expect non-GAAP interest and other expenses of about $42 million and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 10.2%. And in the fourth quarter, we expect non-GAAP OpEx to be around $675 million. The projected increase is primarily targeted at R&D for new opportunities we're pursuing in emerging inflections. To summarize, one, our markets are sustainably better than at any other time in the history of the company; two, our competitive position and execution is sustainably better, giving us a strong pipeline of new and disruptive products and gross margin expansion; three, this growth, combined with disciplined investment and spending, is generating higher free cash flow and we're committed to returning the excess to our shareholders. Now Mike, let's start the Q&A. Michael Sullivan Thanks, Bob. [Operator Instructions]. Let's please begin. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Christopher Muse I guess question around sustainability. You're guiding WFE $40-plus billion here for '17. And curious, what gives you the confidence to be so upbeat looking into '18 and beyond? And I guess as part of that, would love to hear your thoughts in terms of the contributions from areas like AI and public cloud investments versus, I guess, more traditional areas like smartphone and PCs in the past. Robert Halliday Sure. Let me see if I can try to give you context. I think context rather than point answer is useful, give you context over time and context over breadth. So if you look at context, we thought back at Analyst Day last September that 2016 WFE would be about $33.7 billion. And in fact, it ended up a little over $35 billion. We thought at Analyst Day last year, this year would be $34.5 billion. And in fact, it started with a 4 number this year and it looks very healthy. So it's trending up. So then you say, well, where is it trending up? It's kind of up across the board. Earlier in the year, we thought it was kind of 5% up across the board. Now we think the whole thing is up 15%. We're seeing in DRAM, NAND, foundry. Tactically, we're seeing high utilization in all the fabs. We see no diminution of ordering patterns. We don't see double bookings or anything people might fear. So we see -- when you see strength across virtually every customer and virtually every device type, that goes to some root cause questions. So in my opinion, we're facing what we've been talking about for a while which is, there is more root cause demand drivers for devices. Now longer term, those root drive cause factors are going to be things like cars and AR/VR. What we're seeing now is tactically more content in the phones. We see a lot more content in the phones around NAND, DRAM and we also see strength within the processor side on both the cutting edge and the lagging edge. Lagging edge, again, this year, will be over 40% of device types. But the cutting edge is pretty strong, too. So we're seeing broadscale demand. My belief is that in the intermediate term, there's more content going in phones and more going into the big data centers which are both driving this which will help us. So then the question is, why is there more going in? We believe that there's, what I call broadly speaking, more applications for processor technology, more apps on top of it that are driving systemic demand. And I think, frankly, we're in the early innings of it. So if you ask me, okay, is the second half good? Yes, we're okay. If you ask me, is '18 good? Yes, I think it probably starts with a 4 again. It's pretty good. If you ask me long term which is what I spend a lot of time on, I see more root cause drivers for growth in semiconductor and silicon growth than I've seen in years and I think it's sustainable. Gary Dickerson And C.J., this is Gary. If you look out over time what drove our business in the past were the enterprise and PC upgrade cycles, then it moved to mobile, social media, very pervasive and driven by holiday season new products, where all of the consumer electronics companies had to have those products ready for Christmas or Chinese New Year. And as you go forward, we talked about AI and the importance of capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data is really going to disrupt big industries, transportation, health care, entertainment, manufacturing. And when you look at AI chips, almost every week, somebody's announcing a new AI chip, that it's at the -- logic devices that are at the physical limits of how big they can build those chips because there's so much value in these changes that are happening in these major industries. And of course, that's great for us. If you're building these big logic chips, you need better transistors, you need much better interconnect technology and you also need more memory which is materials-enabled and another area that's in the sweet spot for Applied Materials. So longer term, these inflections really create even more sustainability in terms of our markets going forward. Operator Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Harlan Sur On the China domestic semiconductor market and the outlook there, especially as we think about looking into 2018, I think conservatively, we're tracking 3 to 4 domestic foundry programs and about 4 to 5 memory programs. Foundry, obviously, is a bit more mature. Memory, we're kind of early innings, like Phase 1 kind of development. But especially on sort of memory in China and we get this question a lot from investors which is, is the team starting to get pipeline visibility into some of these programs actually starting to fire the confidence level that these programs are going to contribute to potentially a growth outlook for 2018? Love to get your views here. Gary Dickerson Yes, thanks for the question. China's one of our strongest regions for both semiconductor and display, very deep customer relationships. And what we're looking at for 2017, if we compare to '15, it's about 2x growth in our semiconductor business, 50% growth in service, 50% in display. And the business is really driven by a couple of different strategic factors. One is, there's a big gap between supply and demand and there's this large drive to try to close that gap and then also building a secure supply chain. When we look into 2018, what we're seeing right now is that the overall wafer fab equipment spending could be meaningfully up, more than $1 billion, maybe $1.5 billion from '17 to '18 and the domestic part of that increase is also up a meaningful amount in 2018. I don't know, Bob, if you want to add anything else? Robert Halliday Yes, I think that's pretty accurate. And if you ask us to look longer term, we see the domestic -- we see the total going up basically every year and the domestic part, in particular, going up every year. Operator Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company. Timothy Arcuri Bob, I actually have 2 questions. Number one, just on the recent debt raise. I know you paid down $200 million of debt with that money. But I'm surprised that there's not kind of a new capital return that was announced with that. So I guess that's my first question. And then I wanted to also ask about SSG in the back half of the year because if I run the numbers on calendar first half of the year, you're sort of annualizing to like $42 billion WFE roughly. And if we're going to be at $40 billion for the year, then that would sort of say that the back half has to be down like roughly 10%. So I'm wondering if that math's right. Robert Halliday Yes, 2 complicated questions. The first one, we raised money frankly from an opportunistic point of view and frankly a shareholder perspective. So if you look it, we raised $2.2 billion, now we had to repay $2 billion -- $200 million, so it's about $2 billion net. And it was about 50% of it was 10-year money, about 50% was 30-year money. And the 10% money, maybe like 3.3% and 4.3%, okay? So the average rate is about 3.8%. So basically what we're bringing into our capital structure is long term debt at low rates that's pseudo-equity at low cost of capital. So that's pretty attractive. The second thing we're doing, many people believe that there'll be some type of tax policy change this year or next which will ease and facilitate the return of cash from overseas locations. Well, we're kind of hedging our bets. We're not sure about the timing and we want to stay committed to shareholder returns and keep our tax structure in place until there are any substantive changes. So I think this raise, if anything, was to continue to support meaningful returns of capital to investors. And as we said on the call, we've returned over 100% over the last 5 years. In this past quarter, the total was over $380 million, I think, between dividends and buybacks. So I think we're very committed to shareholder returns. We will hit the model which is shrinking the share count. And if we get more line of sight to what's going to happen on the tax policy, then we'll clearly react more effectively and more efficiently to how to maximize those shareholder returns. In terms of the -- how's the year look, we gave in the call a few data points. One, we said that our revenues in '17 fiscal year versus '13 were going to be up 90%. So you can see, we're going to have a good year. So my take on it is, the year is a good year. Our take on it is the year will continue to strengthen throughout the year. Our take on it is that we're going to gain share this year. So it's going to be a really good year for us. And that's just semi. Display, we're going to do well, too. We believe those drivers that drive the market and our share continue for a number of years. So is the number a $40 billion number or north of a $40 billion number? All we want to say now here in early May is it starts with a 4. It's up significantly from last year and it strengthened all year. Operator Our next question comes from Farhan Ahmad of Crédit Suisse. Farhan Ahmad My question is, you've already talked about it quite a bit. Generally just wondering if you guys have done any sort of analysis if one particular segment would benefit more than the other in terms of logic, NAND or foundry? Gary Dickerson I think relative to AI, as I mentioned earlier, you see announcements almost every week of new logic AI chips going to the physical limits of the reticle field, so the physical limits or the ability of the semiconductor companies to build those chips. So a tremendous amount of transistors, vias, interconnect technology, all of that is in the sweet spot for Applied Materials. Our Transistor and Interconnect Group, all of those different products, epi, PVD, CMP, thermal processing, implant, are really unique and very strong positions for Applied Materials. So that growth is really exactly aligned with the products that we have in logic and in foundry and give us really a great growth opportunity. The other part of it's the materials enables memory scaling. More and more you're seeing devices going from 2 dimensions to 3 dimensions. And as they're going to 3 dimensions, really, the ability to scale the performance and also the cost is all about new materials, new deposition, epi, new etch technology, selective removal, all of those areas. And personally, I'm increasingly optimistic that we have very innovative, highly differentiated new technologies that will not only enable further scaling in 3D NAND technology, but also enable new memory technologies. Our position there is very, very strong. The relationships and the engagements that we have with customers are broader and deeper than we've ever had in the past. Operator Our next question comes from Atif Malik of Citi. Atif Malik I have a question on the display part. So at the Analyst Day last year, you guys talked about expanding the TAM on the display products from 15% to 30%, 40% over the next 2 years. Just curious, how are your engagements going with those new display products so far? Gary Dickerson So we have very broad and deep relationships with all the leading companies in display and also the leading consumer electronics companies that are using those displays. So we're in a really great position to enable these new technologies. And as customers are moving forward with new display technology, it increases our total available market and puts us in a good position to continue to grow that business. If you look at display overall, you really have 2 big drivers. One is the strong organic LED for mobile opportunity and that is a broadening out to a large number of customers and also, the increased adoption of larger TV screens. So both of those are driving our business. As I said earlier, we have very strong and deep relationships with leading customers and we're focused on the biggest technology challenges. If you look at all of those customers that want to get into the growing mobile OLED market, we're focused on the major technology challenges that enable those customers to build those kinds of devices. We're not ready to announce any specific opportunities at this point in time but we will later this year. Operator Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sreekrishnan Sankar The question I had was WFE running at 40 billion, 40 plus billion this year and next year, where do you think 3D NAND WFE is within that? And if the prices for NAND roll over, the reality of economics kick in and 3D NAND makers scale back the CapEx. Or do you think demand is strong enough to continue investing in capacity for the next 2 to 4 years? Robert Halliday Sure. So the question was, is 3D NAND going to keep expanding? Is that -- yes. So let me take a shot at that. So 3D NAND spending is up this year. It was up again last year. If you look at it, there's about 1.6 million wafer starts in the world of 3D NAND -- NAND in total. By the end of this year, they will convert at 750,000 wafer starts per month. So there's still a fair amount that's going to convert. I think that the vast majority that's going to convert over time because 3D performs better than 2D. I think what also helps memory in general, particularly NAND, is that more and more customers' customers are starting swap out 3D NAND over time for hard disk drives. So overall, demand for memory is going up. The share of NAND, far versus how this drive will trend up and 3D will be the NAND of choice versus 2D. So they're early in the build-out, 750,000. They got to get to 1.6 million. And we think that the installed capacity is going to go up over time because of this demand. Then if you look at greenfield versus refresh, we're kind of agnostic, frankly. So if you look at the cost of doing a greenfield 3D NAND factory, we do well. In fact, we're gaining share at virtually every product, I believe. If you look at transition of one 3D to a higher level of 3D, the revenue opportunity for us is about the same. Operator Our next question comes from Stephen Chin of UBS. Stephen Chin Just a follow-up question on the higher outlook for wafer fab equipment spending. What customer type is driving that big increase in your WFE? And do you think this $40 billion number is the new normalized level for WFE and not a peak? Robert Halliday Yes, it was seen across the board. We're seeing it at NAND, DRAM and foundry. Logic's kind of flattish. We're seeing it at almost every customer, I think, too. So it's very broad. And when you get that broad, it's not, hey, they're timing DRAM, they're putting more DRAM in a PC. The root cause is broader than that because it's across a wide range of device types of customers. So then you say, what is the application for driving? We do think it's more and more about more applications for your PC and your data center and stuff like that. So it does start to see these AI stuff, deep learning. Can I point exactly how much does AI I know? But it's across the board we're seeing this, right? So then in terms of the number, those are, I called earlier, I think this year begins with a 4. But I'm not saying it's 40, frankly. It's a good number and I think next year's a good number. So I actually think the new normal is 40 plus. I think what I worry about internally at the company, that we don't plan more for the upside than downside. I think there's more opportunity on the upside than the downside. Gary Dickerson One thing I'd add to that is that I think everybody is seeing a large increase in the amount of data and also the value of the data. If you look at deep learning, the amount of data that you process is going to go up. Right now, a lot of data's thrown away. So you've got an increase in the amount of data and then the amount of data that's processed is also going to increase. So both of those factors make me personally pretty bullish about the memory business long term. And certainly, that's also what we're hearing from our customers. Operator Our next question comes from Romit Shah of Nomura. Romit Shah I did notice that display revenues were a little light in the quarter and that margins were down about 5 points. Can you talk about that, Bob? Is that just short term noise? And last quarter, you gave a target for display. I think it was up -- for 2017, up 50%. Do you still feel good about that? Robert Halliday Yes, we do. It's just timing and it's just logistical. Display's going to have a really good year. The underlying market dynamics are very strong for both TVs and mobile. And our position's really good. So I think display is strongly a lot of opportunity. And then we have a product cycle we've discussed coming on board later in the year. So I'm bullish on display and I think I wouldn't read too much in these quarterly numbers. In terms of the numbers we set last quarter, yes, we'll hit those. Yes. Operator Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari Bob, I had a question on gross margins. You guys showed nice upside in the quarter. And just wondering what the drivers were here. In the past, I think you pointed to outsized growth and things like etch and display that were headwinds to the business. The recent improvement, is that a function of that headwind abating? Or is that a combination of mix shift and also fundamental and sustainable improvement across the board? Robert Halliday Yes. If you look at a company like Applied, the gross margin improvement or change is a function primarily of 2 things and one third thing that's a little smaller. One is execution and second is mix and the third which is a little smaller, is absorption with volume, right? So if you look at execution, that's really three things, how you're executing cost reduction; how you're executing on new product development; and how you're executing in terms of field execution. So if you go look at it, this year, we're up a lot. We're up over a couple -- I don't know, several points. And if you look at it, I would say that the improvement -- we have underlying improved execution. So this year, we're up about almost, what, 3 points? So if you look at it this year, execution is trending up and that'll continue on for a while. I think every year, we'll get better.  Now we're benefiting from pretty good mix shifts. It's been a good year for our products in the TIG family, PVD, epi, things like that. And so it's helped a little bit. And absorption's helped a little bit this year. It's a pretty big year. It's over 40 and we're gaining share. But I would say that the overall gross margin performance of the company will trend up over time, but this year was helped a little bit by volume and by mix. But I would say I'm still positively upward bound on margins. So if you go -- if we have to redo a model in Analyst Day, I'd probably lean in on a higher WFE and higher margins. Operator Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore I wanted to follow up on some of the questions on the upward revision in WFE, particularly with regards to memory. We look at sort of memory cash flows and make some assumptions that there's just an algorithmic percentage of that peak cash flow that gets spent which is probably more negative than what you guys are describing that there are sort of people who are looking at the current situation and deciding that they need more supply. I mean, I guess it's more semantics, I guess. But how do you characterize when you see the upward revision that we've seen in just a 6-month window? How much of that is just because prices are better, companies have cash flow and they use it to improve their competitive position versus something that's more sort of structural and dynamic? How do you interpret it as more structural aspect versus just better pricing? Robert Halliday We look at a few things. Yes, we dug into this ourselves, too. We looked at what's driving this data. We looked at some cosmic data. So we looked at the stuff like how much data is captured out there. And we capture -- it was like 8 zettabytes of data was captured in 2016, I think, close to 25 zettabytes of data in 2020 and then it goes to like 45 zettabytes of data. So more and more data has been captured. It's gone up a lot, even in your homes, your cars, your industry, your companies. Then we look at the transmission, processing, source of that data we talked about. So when we start to look at root causes, we've seen a lot of this stuff, right? So then you go look at what's going on more close to planet Earth. And so we looked at this and we said, well, what's going on with NAND and DRAM? We split them up. DRAM's up but it's the still not through the roof. It's pretty good but still kind of restrained because a fair amount of this budget's being spent on NAND. So DRAM price is good. NAND price is good. Supply and demand's okay. So the DRAM, I would say, has probably gotten a little more upside than downside, frankly, in '18 because this year it hasn't been through the roof. It's up from what we thought earlier in the year. And then if you look at NAND, they're selling all the 3D NAND they can build. So it's still pretty good and I do think it goes to these longer term trends they have at NAND. So then if you look at the -- the final thing is just, well, how come you guys are low early in the year? And I think it goes to 2 root causes which, frankly, inflict all of us. One is I think we're a little bit a prisoner of past thinking. So okay, it can only go so high. But it goes to what Gary said earlier. There's different fundamental demand drivers at a simple level. It was, hey, use PCs. Then we agreed, okay, in 2010, mobile's coming in. And then -- but now you had all this big data stuff in content which is going up. That's what's really up last year. So it's content in the phones, content in the data centers, right? And so when you start to look, what were we inflicted with? We were saying, oh, we're going to roll over. But maybe there's real demand drivers here, number one. And number two, sometimes we listen too closely to our customers on a tactical basis.  They have to give us good demand forecast for kind of 6 months out so we could build the tools. Beyond that 6 months, maybe they're a little conservative to what they say to us for various reasons. So I think there are tactical reasons why we're a little too conservative. And I think that will -- data that shows it's not overbought now and there are longer term reasons that make you think this is very sustainable. Operator Our next question comes from Patrick Ho of Stifel. Patrick Ho Gary or Bob, in terms of the display business for you guys, we do see the longer term trends of OLED. Can you give a little bit of qualitative commentary on the LCD side of things, how you're benefiting this year as TV sizes do grow larger? Is this also one of those sustainable trends? Or is this just going to be a 1-year or 1.5-year phenomenon as the industry transitions on that front? Robert Halliday Yes, I'll start and Gary can jump in. Gary's TV aging is a little obsolete at his home base, but I'll start. So if you go look at this year, we're going to be strong in both TVs and mobile. TV's largely LCD. Mobile is -- the spending is largely for OLED, okay? So if you look at the 2 drivers, in OLED, it's conversion of the phones which we've talked about. My estimate is likely early in '18, about 37%, 38% of the phones, there'll be capacity to make them OLED even though the demand is there. We think it will be about 55%, as we said earlier in kind of 2020. I think it is 67%, 2021. So really, OLED phone displays is kind of supply constrained, to be honest with you. So that's very sustainable. I think it will keep going up beyond 67% is my opinion, too, in 2021. I remember everything, we got backlog kind of ships 6 to 9 months later. So you have extra length on the revenue. Then if you go to TVs, what's really driving the TVs is the big TVs. So we said at Analyst Day that through 2020, I think it was, we're tracking 7 Gen 10.5 fabs. We're now up to 9. And so -- and those [indiscernible] is just starting to ship, okay? And those fabs, on average, spend more than a Gen 8.5. I think there's been about $2.2 billion where it's like $1.2 billion, I think, on a Gen 8.5. So this big TV stuff's got legs for a while. And the capital intensity for these bigger fabs is good and our position's real good. Operator Our next question comes from Weston Twigg of Pacific Crest Securities. Weston Twigg You mentioned earlier on the call regarding bit density and 3D NAND from generation to generation being slower than the planar NAND conversion. So just wondering, could you give us an idea on how much more fab capacity might be needed annually to drive, say, 40% bit growth and what the incremental opportunity can be for AMAT? Robert Halliday Sure. Some of this goes to what I said earlier. So we see and I think we're a little bit on the low side sometimes, that NAND bit growth is going to be probably in the high 30s or something like that. Now last year was much higher. If you look at content in phones, it was up like -- the data we got from an outside service provider was 57%. So there are indications that we're on the low side on some of these things. Plus we're not sure we've captured all the movement to hard disk drives. So I'd say I'm more on the over camp in that number than the under. So then if you go look at it, as I said earlier, the 750,000 wafer starts by the end of this year, we think that they're going to have to continue to spend in dollars WFE content similar to this year for a number of years. Now if they spend on greenfield or they spend on conversions, we're kind of agnostic from a revenue point of view. But we think the total spending is similar to this year for a number of years. Operator Our next question comes from Craig Ellis of B. Riley. Craig Ellis I wanted to follow up on the comments that you had, Bob, that there were some project-related R&D spending in the outlooks numbers. The question is to what extent is that more of a near term micro opportunity that the company is using versus something that may be more longer term and structural, either because you're viewing the market opportunity differently over the next few years and are chasing some additional existing SAM or as you look at different opportunities, chasing some new SAM that's emerged over the last 3 to 6 months? Robert Halliday Yes. I think increasing the R&D spend was a wise decision, frankly. I think that when we showed you the model -- if you go back to 2013 when I first got here, we showed the first model. Our base case model was kind of a $30 billion base case. And then we did a $33.5 billion. Last year, it was $34.5 billion, I think. If I had to do a base case model for the industry, it's probably -- it's going to be north of that. I don't want to presell Analyst Day in September, but it's obviously north of that. The second thing is our position's a lot stronger. We used to be 18% of WFE and I think last year, we were like 22% or something. We're still going up. Our model is to hit the 25.5%.  We're comfortable with that. So if you look at Applied and then display, the magnitude of the change is big or bigger. It was an $8 billion spending environment when we set up and now it's kind of twice that. Our product pipeline is good. So I think the wise decision is to continue to invest in the opportunities. Now customers are coming to us more and more because we've become even more innovative than we were. So if you look at the range of products we're doing, the innovation in terms of the pipeline, really good. So we're getting lots of pull from customers to develop new products. They're taking more and more demo tools from us. We're getting more and more applications. So I think it's money well spent. I think it'll probably trend up. If you look at the model, probably a little bit of risk that the OpEx is higher than the model, but OpEx as a percentage of sales is down 10 points from 2013 by the end of this year. If you look at operating margins, they're up significantly and will probably beat the model. The upside's lower than the downside on the revenue gross margin, operating margins in the model. Gary Dickerson In terms of where we're focused, the strategy for us has been inflection-focused innovation. There are really big inflections that are happening at 10- and 7-nanometer. When you're building these AI chips that are as big as the physical limits, there are a lot of technology challenges. We talked about PVD growing this last year to enable the interconnect -- new interconnect technology for lower-power devices. You've got high-performance memory chips also where the PVD is growing for us. And in the -- and the memory area, the ability to scale 3D NAND, is there's big technical challenges there for our customers. And it's really all about etch, deposition. We've got very innovative new materials. The etch area, we've grown our market share significantly over the last few years. Great products, some of the best products I've ever seen in my life. Sym3 is the fastest-growing product in the history of the company. The Selectra product, where we have 1,000 to 1 selectivity. These are enabling customers to build devices that were never possible before and build them in different ways, scale these new technologies, build the logic devices at the physical limits or -- and the same thing is true in display. For organic LED mobile displays, there are technology challenges that are facing customers that want to ramp new factories for those new types of devices. So for me, personally, we've -- I look at Applied Materials, our competencies, technologies, talent is really unbelievable and sets us apart from any other company. And we're really in a sweet spot of all of these major inflections. So we've certainly moved a lot of money within the company over the last few years. The OpEx as a percentage of revenue has been going done. But we're going to invest to enable these inflections and drive sustainable growth for the company. The opportunities for us have never been better. Operator Our next question comes from Edwin Mok of Needham. Edwin Mok Just want to circle back on China. You guys mentioned expect a pretty significant pickup in spending in China in 2018. Maybe if I -- we focus on the memory side. We've seen like some of these customer announce pretty aggressive road map for the 3D NAND technology. Just wondering, is this bigger spending in '18 predicated on those customer hitting those targets or rolling out those devices and if they have issues going on with the devices that delay the spending that you expect in '18? Gary Dickerson We have a range of forecast for China. So as I said earlier, it's one of our strongest regions in both semiconductor and display. We have very, very deep relationships with many of these customers. Right now, what we believe for 2018 is that the business will be up meaningfully from 2017. But frankly, that's also at the most likely and low risk end of the forecast. There's a higher range there that would be going up at a much faster pace. We're looking at early indicators for all of those new projects, but I think right now, we're pretty confident that the increase in China in 2018 will happen. Maybe it's $1 billion, $1.5 billion in terms of total wafer fab equipment. So that we have pretty high confidence in terms of the engagements or the information we're getting from all of those customers. There is upside potential, but that's our current view. Operator Our next question comes from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. Shek Ho Going back to the question on capital returns, your free cash flow as a percentage of revenue has come up quite a bit over the past 5 years. I think it was averaging like 15% and now it was more like 20%-plus. Your dividend yield has come down quite a bit as well just because your stock has done so well. But with the long term debt you raised recently, I know you explained that earlier in the call, but just curious, are there any changes to your philosophy in capital returns? I guess specifically, why not raise your dividend and maybe spend a little less on buybacks and -- given dividend hasn't gone up for a number of years? Or are you saving some dry powder for future M&A? Robert Halliday I think we'll probably -- I think we'll continue to return -- the total of all cash to investors will be very, very healthy. I think that the mix will probably morph over time through dividends. We haven't made a firm commitment but I think it will happen. I think the 2 things that I'm kind of watching is, one, I think I'd like to see tax policy because dividend's a firm, fixed commitment. As soon as you make it, then you got to hit it every quarter. And you really have to lean into where you're going to end up, what's your end stake, because people look at the yield, not with -- did you raise it $0.02 a quarter. So we have to commit to a dividend increase over time that gets to effective yield. And with the stock going up, that cash commitment has gone up. So I'm willing to do that, but I'd like to see clarity on the tax policy before I make that fixed commitment to an increasing yield. Michael Sullivan Thanks, Sydney, for the question. And Latiff, time check. I just want to see if there's anyone in the queue still. Operator Yes, sir, we do have one more question in queue. Michael Sullivan Okay. Thank you. We'll take that question and then we'll bring it back to me. Thanks. Operator That question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Harlan Sur You guys talked a lot about some of the trends driving logic and foundry, AI, deep learning, VR, data center. And it's interesting because these drivers have some of the biggest chip sizes in the industry, right? In videos, the latest deep learning chip has 18 billion transistors on a single piece of silicon. Broadcom's latest data center switching chip has like 7 billion transistors. These are huge chips, right? My point is that each of these units is consuming more silicon but they're also requiring more leading-edge complex manufacturing. So this is great for capital intensity trends. It's great for equipment business. But frankly, it's a nightmare from a yield perspective. So help us understand the trends you're seeing in your metrology and inspection business and how you guys are helping your customers improve yields. You guys gained share in this segment last year. How do you think this segment grows relative to your overall semi systems business this year? Gary Dickerson Okay. Thanks for the question, Harlan. Yes. Again, on the large logic chips that you talked about, we actually had the NVIDIA CEO here just a few months ago. And one of the questions was, really, what does all of this mean to us? And he talked about physical, the chip's as big as they can physically build them. And actually, he also said, a million times more memory. So all of those things are obviously positive for Applied Materials. In inspection share, we're -- or inspection business, we're growing significant amount. We had record revenue in '16. We're on track for record revenue in '17. And if you look at our e-beam business which is our largest part of PDC which includes e-beam inspection, e-beam review and CD-SEM, we're going to be up in '17 more than 50% versus '15. We have very, very strong technology position with world-class electron optics and very strong customer pull for e-beam products in logic, foundry and repeat orders for the PROVision in memory with some large customers. So very, very strong position. We have great technology, very strong customer pull and we believe that we're going to continue the growth that we've seen over the last couple of years in our PDC business. Michael Sullivan Great. Well, thanks, Harlan, for the question. And Bob, would you like to add anything else before we close the call? Robert Halliday Sure. Thanks, Mike. One of Gary's favorite expressions around here is innovation's about connecting the dots. Let me see if I connect a few dots that I -- we believe and I hope you heard today. One, we believe the wafer fab equipment market is sustainably higher and less volatile. Also, display is higher and for Applied, it's sustainably a better market because there are more technology inflections and because we're growing our served market. Second, Applied's position in the market is sustainably stronger. And we're executing better and better. And third, we're generating more free cash flow and returning the excess to our shareholders. Speaking of free cash flow, one of your own interesting note comparing Applied Materials to some of the top names in the industrial sector. Relative to the average of the companies, Applied has higher revenue and profit growth along with higher ROIC and free cash flow margins. Compared to these companies, I believe we're being discounted for being more cyclical even as we become demonstrably less cyclical. I believe that over time, we'll be viewed and valued in a new way. So thank you for your time today. And we look forward to seeing many of you in person over the next few weeks. Michael Sullivan Well, great. Thanks, Bob. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon. A replay of the call is going to be available on the website beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific Time today. And we thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, you may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day.

Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Christopher Muse I guess question around sustainability. You're guiding WFE $40-plus billion here for '17. And curious, what gives you the confidence to be so upbeat looking into '18 and beyond? And I guess as part of that, would love to hear your thoughts in terms of the contributions from areas like AI and public cloud investments versus, I guess, more traditional areas like smartphone and PCs in the past. Robert Halliday Sure. Let me see if I can try to give you context. I think context rather than point answer is useful, give you context over time and context over breadth. So if you look at context, we thought back at Analyst Day last September that 2016 WFE would be about $33.7 billion. And in fact, it ended up a little over $35 billion. We thought at Analyst Day last year, this year would be $34.5 billion. And in fact, it started with a 4 number this year and it looks very healthy. So it's trending up. So then you say, well, where is it trending up? It's kind of up across the board. Earlier in the year, we thought it was kind of 5% up across the board. Now we think the whole thing is up 15%. We're seeing in DRAM, NAND, foundry. Tactically, we're seeing high utilization in all the fabs. We see no diminution of ordering patterns. We don't see double bookings or anything people might fear. So we see -- when you see strength across virtually every customer and virtually every device type, that goes to some root cause questions. So in my opinion, we're facing what we've been talking about for a while which is, there is more root cause demand drivers for devices. Now longer term, those root drive cause factors are going to be things like cars and AR/VR. What we're seeing now is tactically more content in the phones. We see a lot more content in the phones around NAND, DRAM and we also see strength within the processor side on both the cutting edge and the lagging edge. Lagging edge, again, this year, will be over 40% of device types. But the cutting edge is pretty strong, too. So we're seeing broadscale demand. My belief is that in the intermediate term, there's more content going in phones and more going into the big data centers which are both driving this which will help us. So then the question is, why is there more going in? We believe that there's, what I call broadly speaking, more applications for processor technology, more apps on top of it that are driving systemic demand. And I think, frankly, we're in the early innings of it. So if you ask me, okay, is the second half good? Yes, we're okay. If you ask me, is '18 good? Yes, I think it probably starts with a 4 again. It's pretty good. If you ask me long term which is what I spend a lot of time on, I see more root cause drivers for growth in semiconductor and silicon growth than I've seen in years and I think it's sustainable. Gary Dickerson And C.J., this is Gary. If you look out over time what drove our business in the past were the enterprise and PC upgrade cycles, then it moved to mobile, social media, very pervasive and driven by holiday season new products, where all of the consumer electronics companies had to have those products ready for Christmas or Chinese New Year. And as you go forward, we talked about AI and the importance of capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data is really going to disrupt big industries, transportation, health care, entertainment, manufacturing. And when you look at AI chips, almost every week, somebody's announcing a new AI chip, that it's at the -- logic devices that are at the physical limits of how big they can build those chips because there's so much value in these changes that are happening in these major industries. And of course, that's great for us. If you're building these big logic chips, you need better transistors, you need much better interconnect technology and you also need more memory which is materials-enabled and another area that's in the sweet spot for Applied Materials. So longer term, these inflections really create even more sustainability in terms of our markets going forward. Operator Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Harlan Sur On the China domestic semiconductor market and the outlook there, especially as we think about looking into 2018, I think conservatively, we're tracking 3 to 4 domestic foundry programs and about 4 to 5 memory programs. Foundry, obviously, is a bit more mature. Memory, we're kind of early innings, like Phase 1 kind of development. But especially on sort of memory in China and we get this question a lot from investors which is, is the team starting to get pipeline visibility into some of these programs actually starting to fire the confidence level that these programs are going to contribute to potentially a growth outlook for 2018? Love to get your views here. Gary Dickerson Yes, thanks for the question. China's one of our strongest regions for both semiconductor and display, very deep customer relationships. And what we're looking at for 2017, if we compare to '15, it's about 2x growth in our semiconductor business, 50% growth in service, 50% in display. And the business is really driven by a couple of different strategic factors. One is, there's a big gap between supply and demand and there's this large drive to try to close that gap and then also building a secure supply chain. When we look into 2018, what we're seeing right now is that the overall wafer fab equipment spending could be meaningfully up, more than $1 billion, maybe $1.5 billion from '17 to '18 and the domestic part of that increase is also up a meaningful amount in 2018. I don't know, Bob, if you want to add anything else? Robert Halliday Yes, I think that's pretty accurate. And if you ask us to look longer term, we see the domestic -- we see the total going up basically every year and the domestic part, in particular, going up every year. Operator Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company. Timothy Arcuri Bob, I actually have 2 questions. Number one, just on the recent debt raise. I know you paid down $200 million of debt with that money. But I'm surprised that there's not kind of a new capital return that was announced with that. So I guess that's my first question. And then I wanted to also ask about SSG in the back half of the year because if I run the numbers on calendar first half of the year, you're sort of annualizing to like $42 billion WFE roughly. And if we're going to be at $40 billion for the year, then that would sort of say that the back half has to be down like roughly 10%. So I'm wondering if that math's right. Robert Halliday Yes, 2 complicated questions. The first one, we raised money frankly from an opportunistic point of view and frankly a shareholder perspective. So if you look it, we raised $2.2 billion, now we had to repay $2 billion -- $200 million, so it's about $2 billion net. And it was about 50% of it was 10-year money, about 50% was 30-year money. And the 10% money, maybe like 3.3% and 4.3%, okay? So the average rate is about 3.8%. So basically what we're bringing into our capital structure is long term debt at low rates that's pseudo-equity at low cost of capital. So that's pretty attractive. The second thing we're doing, many people believe that there'll be some type of tax policy change this year or next which will ease and facilitate the return of cash from overseas locations. Well, we're kind of hedging our bets. We're not sure about the timing and we want to stay committed to shareholder returns and keep our tax structure in place until there are any substantive changes. So I think this raise, if anything, was to continue to support meaningful returns of capital to investors. And as we said on the call, we've returned over 100% over the last 5 years. In this past quarter, the total was over $380 million, I think, between dividends and buybacks. So I think we're very committed to shareholder returns. We will hit the model which is shrinking the share count. And if we get more line of sight to what's going to happen on the tax policy, then we'll clearly react more effectively and more efficiently to how to maximize those shareholder returns. In terms of the -- how's the year look, we gave in the call a few data points. One, we said that our revenues in '17 fiscal year versus '13 were going to be up 90%. So you can see, we're going to have a good year. So my take on it is, the year is a good year. Our take on it is the year will continue to strengthen throughout the year. Our take on it is that we're going to gain share this year. So it's going to be a really good year for us. And that's just semi. Display, we're going to do well, too. We believe those drivers that drive the market and our share continue for a number of years. So is the number a $40 billion number or north of a $40 billion number? All we want to say now here in early May is it starts with a 4. It's up significantly from last year and it strengthened all year. Operator Our next question comes from Farhan Ahmad of Crédit Suisse. Farhan Ahmad My question is, you've already talked about it quite a bit. Generally just wondering if you guys have done any sort of analysis if one particular segment would benefit more than the other in terms of logic, NAND or foundry? Gary Dickerson I think relative to AI, as I mentioned earlier, you see announcements almost every week of new logic AI chips going to the physical limits of the reticle field, so the physical limits or the ability of the semiconductor companies to build those chips. So a tremendous amount of transistors, vias, interconnect technology, all of that is in the sweet spot for Applied Materials. Our Transistor and Interconnect Group, all of those different products, epi, PVD, CMP, thermal processing, implant, are really unique and very strong positions for Applied Materials. So that growth is really exactly aligned with the products that we have in logic and in foundry and give us really a great growth opportunity. The other part of it's the materials enables memory scaling. More and more you're seeing devices going from 2 dimensions to 3 dimensions. And as they're going to 3 dimensions, really, the ability to scale the performance and also the cost is all about new materials, new deposition, epi, new etch technology, selective removal, all of those areas. And personally, I'm increasingly optimistic that we have very innovative, highly differentiated new technologies that will not only enable further scaling in 3D NAND technology, but also enable new memory technologies. Our position there is very, very strong. The relationships and the engagements that we have with customers are broader and deeper than we've ever had in the past. Operator Our next question comes from Atif Malik of Citi. Atif Malik I have a question on the display part. So at the Analyst Day last year, you guys talked about expanding the TAM on the display products from 15% to 30%, 40% over the next 2 years. Just curious, how are your engagements going with those new display products so far? Gary Dickerson So we have very broad and deep relationships with all the leading companies in display and also the leading consumer electronics companies that are using those displays. So we're in a really great position to enable these new technologies. And as customers are moving forward with new display technology, it increases our total available market and puts us in a good position to continue to grow that business. If you look at display overall, you really have 2 big drivers. One is the strong organic LED for mobile opportunity and that is a broadening out to a large number of customers and also, the increased adoption of larger TV screens. So both of those are driving our business. As I said earlier, we have very strong and deep relationships with leading customers and we're focused on the biggest technology challenges. If you look at all of those customers that want to get into the growing mobile OLED market, we're focused on the major technology challenges that enable those customers to build those kinds of devices. We're not ready to announce any specific opportunities at this point in time but we will later this year. Operator Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sreekrishnan Sankar The question I had was WFE running at 40 billion, 40 plus billion this year and next year, where do you think 3D NAND WFE is within that? And if the prices for NAND roll over, the reality of economics kick in and 3D NAND makers scale back the CapEx. Or do you think demand is strong enough to continue investing in capacity for the next 2 to 4 years? Robert Halliday Sure. So the question was, is 3D NAND going to keep expanding? Is that -- yes. So let me take a shot at that. So 3D NAND spending is up this year. It was up again last year. If you look at it, there's about 1.6 million wafer starts in the world of 3D NAND -- NAND in total. By the end of this year, they will convert at 750,000 wafer starts per month. So there's still a fair amount that's going to convert. I think that the vast majority that's going to convert over time because 3D performs better than 2D. I think what also helps memory in general, particularly NAND, is that more and more customers' customers are starting swap out 3D NAND over time for hard disk drives. So overall, demand for memory is going up. The share of NAND, far versus how this drive will trend up and 3D will be the NAND of choice versus 2D. So they're early in the build-out, 750,000. They got to get to 1.6 million. And we think that the installed capacity is going to go up over time because of this demand. Then if you look at greenfield versus refresh, we're kind of agnostic, frankly. So if you look at the cost of doing a greenfield 3D NAND factory, we do well. In fact, we're gaining share at virtually every product, I believe. If you look at transition of one 3D to a higher level of 3D, the revenue opportunity for us is about the same. Operator Our next question comes from Stephen Chin of UBS. Stephen Chin Just a follow-up question on the higher outlook for wafer fab equipment spending. What customer type is driving that big increase in your WFE? And do you think this $40 billion number is the new normalized level for WFE and not a peak? Robert Halliday Yes, it was seen across the board. We're seeing it at NAND, DRAM and foundry. Logic's kind of flattish. We're seeing it at almost every customer, I think, too. So it's very broad. And when you get that broad, it's not, hey, they're timing DRAM, they're putting more DRAM in a PC. The root cause is broader than that because it's across a wide range of device types of customers. So then you say, what is the application for driving? We do think it's more and more about more applications for your PC and your data center and stuff like that. So it does start to see these AI stuff, deep learning. Can I point exactly how much does AI I know? But it's across the board we're seeing this, right? So then in terms of the number, those are, I called earlier, I think this year begins with a 4. But I'm not saying it's 40, frankly. It's a good number and I think next year's a good number. So I actually think the new normal is 40 plus. I think what I worry about internally at the company, that we don't plan more for the upside than downside. I think there's more opportunity on the upside than the downside. Gary Dickerson One thing I'd add to that is that I think everybody is seeing a large increase in the amount of data and also the value of the data. If you look at deep learning, the amount of data that you process is going to go up. Right now, a lot of data's thrown away. So you've got an increase in the amount of data and then the amount of data that's processed is also going to increase. So both of those factors make me personally pretty bullish about the memory business long term. And certainly, that's also what we're hearing from our customers. Operator Our next question comes from Romit Shah of Nomura. Romit Shah I did notice that display revenues were a little light in the quarter and that margins were down about 5 points. Can you talk about that, Bob? Is that just short term noise? And last quarter, you gave a target for display. I think it was up -- for 2017, up 50%. Do you still feel good about that? Robert Halliday Yes, we do. It's just timing and it's just logistical. Display's going to have a really good year. The underlying market dynamics are very strong for both TVs and mobile. And our position's really good. So I think display is strongly a lot of opportunity. And then we have a product cycle we've discussed coming on board later in the year. So I'm bullish on display and I think I wouldn't read too much in these quarterly numbers. In terms of the numbers we set last quarter, yes, we'll hit those. Yes. Operator Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari Bob, I had a question on gross margins. You guys showed nice upside in the quarter. And just wondering what the drivers were here. In the past, I think you pointed to outsized growth and things like etch and display that were headwinds to the business. The recent improvement, is that a function of that headwind abating? Or is that a combination of mix shift and also fundamental and sustainable improvement across the board? Robert Halliday Yes. If you look at a company like Applied, the gross margin improvement or change is a function primarily of 2 things and one third thing that's a little smaller. One is execution and second is mix and the third which is a little smaller, is absorption with volume, right? So if you look at execution, that's really three things, how you're executing cost reduction; how you're executing on new product development; and how you're executing in terms of field execution. So if you go look at it, this year, we're up a lot. We're up over a couple -- I don't know, several points. And if you look at it, I would say that the improvement -- we have underlying improved execution. So this year, we're up about almost, what, 3 points? So if you look at it this year, execution is trending up and that'll continue on for a while. I think every year, we'll get better.  Now we're benefiting from pretty good mix shifts. It's been a good year for our products in the TIG family, PVD, epi, things like that. And so it's helped a little bit. And absorption's helped a little bit this year. It's a pretty big year. It's over 40 and we're gaining share. But I would say that the overall gross margin performance of the company will trend up over time, but this year was helped a little bit by volume and by mix. But I would say I'm still positively upward bound on margins. So if you go -- if we have to redo a model in Analyst Day, I'd probably lean in on a higher WFE and higher margins. Operator Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore I wanted to follow up on some of the questions on the upward revision in WFE, particularly with regards to memory. We look at sort of memory cash flows and make some assumptions that there's just an algorithmic percentage of that peak cash flow that gets spent which is probably more negative than what you guys are describing that there are sort of people who are looking at the current situation and deciding that they need more supply. I mean, I guess it's more semantics, I guess. But how do you characterize when you see the upward revision that we've seen in just a 6-month window? How much of that is just because prices are better, companies have cash flow and they use it to improve their competitive position versus something that's more sort of structural and dynamic? How do you interpret it as more structural aspect versus just better pricing? Robert Halliday We look at a few things. Yes, we dug into this ourselves, too. We looked at what's driving this data. We looked at some cosmic data. So we looked at the stuff like how much data is captured out there. And we capture -- it was like 8 zettabytes of data was captured in 2016, I think, close to 25 zettabytes of data in 2020 and then it goes to like 45 zettabytes of data. So more and more data has been captured. It's gone up a lot, even in your homes, your cars, your industry, your companies. Then we look at the transmission, processing, source of that data we talked about. So when we start to look at root causes, we've seen a lot of this stuff, right? So then you go look at what's going on more close to planet Earth. And so we looked at this and we said, well, what's going on with NAND and DRAM? We split them up. DRAM's up but it's the still not through the roof. It's pretty good but still kind of restrained because a fair amount of this budget's being spent on NAND. So DRAM price is good. NAND price is good. Supply and demand's okay. So the DRAM, I would say, has probably gotten a little more upside than downside, frankly, in '18 because this year it hasn't been through the roof. It's up from what we thought earlier in the year. And then if you look at NAND, they're selling all the 3D NAND they can build. So it's still pretty good and I do think it goes to these longer term trends they have at NAND. So then if you look at the -- the final thing is just, well, how come you guys are low early in the year? And I think it goes to 2 root causes which, frankly, inflict all of us. One is I think we're a little bit a prisoner of past thinking. So okay, it can only go so high. But it goes to what Gary said earlier. There's different fundamental demand drivers at a simple level. It was, hey, use PCs. Then we agreed, okay, in 2010, mobile's coming in. And then -- but now you had all this big data stuff in content which is going up. That's what's really up last year. So it's content in the phones, content in the data centers, right? And so when you start to look, what were we inflicted with? We were saying, oh, we're going to roll over. But maybe there's real demand drivers here, number one. And number two, sometimes we listen too closely to our customers on a tactical basis.  They have to give us good demand forecast for kind of 6 months out so we could build the tools. Beyond that 6 months, maybe they're a little conservative to what they say to us for various reasons. So I think there are tactical reasons why we're a little too conservative. And I think that will -- data that shows it's not overbought now and there are longer term reasons that make you think this is very sustainable. Operator Our next question comes from Patrick Ho of Stifel. Patrick Ho Gary or Bob, in terms of the display business for you guys, we do see the longer term trends of OLED. Can you give a little bit of qualitative commentary on the LCD side of things, how you're benefiting this year as TV sizes do grow larger? Is this also one of those sustainable trends? Or is this just going to be a 1-year or 1.5-year phenomenon as the industry transitions on that front? Robert Halliday Yes, I'll start and Gary can jump in. Gary's TV aging is a little obsolete at his home base, but I'll start. So if you go look at this year, we're going to be strong in both TVs and mobile. TV's largely LCD. Mobile is -- the spending is largely for OLED, okay? So if you look at the 2 drivers, in OLED, it's conversion of the phones which we've talked about. My estimate is likely early in '18, about 37%, 38% of the phones, there'll be capacity to make them OLED even though the demand is there. We think it will be about 55%, as we said earlier in kind of 2020. I think it is 67%, 2021. So really, OLED phone displays is kind of supply constrained, to be honest with you. So that's very sustainable. I think it will keep going up beyond 67% is my opinion, too, in 2021. I remember everything, we got backlog kind of ships 6 to 9 months later. So you have extra length on the revenue. Then if you go to TVs, what's really driving the TVs is the big TVs. So we said at Analyst Day that through 2020, I think it was, we're tracking 7 Gen 10.5 fabs. We're now up to 9. And so -- and those [indiscernible] is just starting to ship, okay? And those fabs, on average, spend more than a Gen 8.5. I think there's been about $2.2 billion where it's like $1.2 billion, I think, on a Gen 8.5. So this big TV stuff's got legs for a while. And the capital intensity for these bigger fabs is good and our position's real good. Operator Our next question comes from Weston Twigg of Pacific Crest Securities. Weston Twigg You mentioned earlier on the call regarding bit density and 3D NAND from generation to generation being slower than the planar NAND conversion. So just wondering, could you give us an idea on how much more fab capacity might be needed annually to drive, say, 40% bit growth and what the incremental opportunity can be for AMAT? Robert Halliday Sure. Some of this goes to what I said earlier. So we see and I think we're a little bit on the low side sometimes, that NAND bit growth is going to be probably in the high 30s or something like that. Now last year was much higher. If you look at content in phones, it was up like -- the data we got from an outside service provider was 57%. So there are indications that we're on the low side on some of these things. Plus we're not sure we've captured all the movement to hard disk drives. So I'd say I'm more on the over camp in that number than the under. So then if you go look at it, as I said earlier, the 750,000 wafer starts by the end of this year, we think that they're going to have to continue to spend in dollars WFE content similar to this year for a number of years. Now if they spend on greenfield or they spend on conversions, we're kind of agnostic from a revenue point of view. But we think the total spending is similar to this year for a number of years. Operator Our next question comes from Craig Ellis of B. Riley. Craig Ellis I wanted to follow up on the comments that you had, Bob, that there were some project-related R&D spending in the outlooks numbers. The question is to what extent is that more of a near term micro opportunity that the company is using versus something that may be more longer term and structural, either because you're viewing the market opportunity differently over the next few years and are chasing some additional existing SAM or as you look at different opportunities, chasing some new SAM that's emerged over the last 3 to 6 months? Robert Halliday Yes. I think increasing the R&D spend was a wise decision, frankly. I think that when we showed you the model -- if you go back to 2013 when I first got here, we showed the first model. Our base case model was kind of a $30 billion base case. And then we did a $33.5 billion. Last year, it was $34.5 billion, I think. If I had to do a base case model for the industry, it's probably -- it's going to be north of that. I don't want to presell Analyst Day in September, but it's obviously north of that. The second thing is our position's a lot stronger. We used to be 18% of WFE and I think last year, we were like 22% or something. We're still going up. Our model is to hit the 25.5%.  We're comfortable with that. So if you look at Applied and then display, the magnitude of the change is big or bigger. It was an $8 billion spending environment when we set up and now it's kind of twice that. Our product pipeline is good. So I think the wise decision is to continue to invest in the opportunities. Now customers are coming to us more and more because we've become even more innovative than we were. So if you look at the range of products we're doing, the innovation in terms of the pipeline, really good. So we're getting lots of pull from customers to develop new products. They're taking more and more demo tools from us. We're getting more and more applications. So I think it's money well spent. I think it'll probably trend up. If you look at the model, probably a little bit of risk that the OpEx is higher than the model, but OpEx as a percentage of sales is down 10 points from 2013 by the end of this year. If you look at operating margins, they're up significantly and will probably beat the model. The upside's lower than the downside on the revenue gross margin, operating margins in the model. Gary Dickerson In terms of where we're focused, the strategy for us has been inflection-focused innovation. There are really big inflections that are happening at 10- and 7-nanometer. When you're building these AI chips that are as big as the physical limits, there are a lot of technology challenges. We talked about PVD growing this last year to enable the interconnect -- new interconnect technology for lower-power devices. You've got high-performance memory chips also where the PVD is growing for us. And in the -- and the memory area, the ability to scale 3D NAND, is there's big technical challenges there for our customers. And it's really all about etch, deposition. We've got very innovative new materials. The etch area, we've grown our market share significantly over the last few years. Great products, some of the best products I've ever seen in my life. Sym3 is the fastest-growing product in the history of the company. The Selectra product, where we have 1,000 to 1 selectivity. These are enabling customers to build devices that were never possible before and build them in different ways, scale these new technologies, build the logic devices at the physical limits or -- and the same thing is true in display. For organic LED mobile displays, there are technology challenges that are facing customers that want to ramp new factories for those new types of devices. So for me, personally, we've -- I look at Applied Materials, our competencies, technologies, talent is really unbelievable and sets us apart from any other company. And we're really in a sweet spot of all of these major inflections. So we've certainly moved a lot of money within the company over the last few years. The OpEx as a percentage of revenue has been going done. But we're going to invest to enable these inflections and drive sustainable growth for the company. The opportunities for us have never been better. Operator Our next question comes from Edwin Mok of Needham. Edwin Mok Just want to circle back on China. You guys mentioned expect a pretty significant pickup in spending in China in 2018. Maybe if I -- we focus on the memory side. We've seen like some of these customer announce pretty aggressive road map for the 3D NAND technology. Just wondering, is this bigger spending in '18 predicated on those customer hitting those targets or rolling out those devices and if they have issues going on with the devices that delay the spending that you expect in '18? Gary Dickerson We have a range of forecast for China. So as I said earlier, it's one of our strongest regions in both semiconductor and display. We have very, very deep relationships with many of these customers. Right now, what we believe for 2018 is that the business will be up meaningfully from 2017. But frankly, that's also at the most likely and low risk end of the forecast. There's a higher range there that would be going up at a much faster pace. We're looking at early indicators for all of those new projects, but I think right now, we're pretty confident that the increase in China in 2018 will happen. Maybe it's $1 billion, $1.5 billion in terms of total wafer fab equipment. So that we have pretty high confidence in terms of the engagements or the information we're getting from all of those customers. There is upside potential, but that's our current view. Operator Our next question comes from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. Shek Ho Going back to the question on capital returns, your free cash flow as a percentage of revenue has come up quite a bit over the past 5 years. I think it was averaging like 15% and now it was more like 20%-plus. Your dividend yield has come down quite a bit as well just because your stock has done so well. But with the long term debt you raised recently, I know you explained that earlier in the call, but just curious, are there any changes to your philosophy in capital returns? I guess specifically, why not raise your dividend and maybe spend a little less on buybacks and -- given dividend hasn't gone up for a number of years? Or are you saving some dry powder for future M&A? Robert Halliday I think we'll probably -- I think we'll continue to return -- the total of all cash to investors will be very, very healthy. I think that the mix will probably morph over time through dividends. We haven't made a firm commitment but I think it will happen. I think the 2 things that I'm kind of watching is, one, I think I'd like to see tax policy because dividend's a firm, fixed commitment. As soon as you make it, then you got to hit it every quarter. And you really have to lean into where you're going to end up, what's your end stake, because people look at the yield, not with -- did you raise it $0.02 a quarter. So we have to commit to a dividend increase over time that gets to effective yield. And with the stock going up, that cash commitment has gone up. So I'm willing to do that, but I'd like to see clarity on the tax policy before I make that fixed commitment to an increasing yield. Michael Sullivan Thanks, Sydney, for the question. And Latiff, time check. I just want to see if there's anyone in the queue still. Operator Yes, sir, we do have one more question in queue. Michael Sullivan Okay. Thank you. We'll take that question and then we'll bring it back to me. Thanks. Operator That question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Harlan Sur You guys talked a lot about some of the trends driving logic and foundry, AI, deep learning, VR, data center. And it's interesting because these drivers have some of the biggest chip sizes in the industry, right? In videos, the latest deep learning chip has 18 billion transistors on a single piece of silicon. Broadcom's latest data center switching chip has like 7 billion transistors. These are huge chips, right? My point is that each of these units is consuming more silicon but they're also requiring more leading-edge complex manufacturing. So this is great for capital intensity trends. It's great for equipment business. But frankly, it's a nightmare from a yield perspective. So help us understand the trends you're seeing in your metrology and inspection business and how you guys are helping your customers improve yields. You guys gained share in this segment last year. How do you think this segment grows relative to your overall semi systems business this year? Gary Dickerson Okay. Thanks for the question, Harlan. Yes. Again, on the large logic chips that you talked about, we actually had the NVIDIA CEO here just a few months ago. And one of the questions was, really, what does all of this mean to us? And he talked about physical, the chip's as big as they can physically build them. And actually, he also said, a million times more memory. So all of those things are obviously positive for Applied Materials. In inspection share, we're -- or inspection business, we're growing significant amount. We had record revenue in '16. We're on track for record revenue in '17. And if you look at our e-beam business which is our largest part of PDC which includes e-beam inspection, e-beam review and CD-SEM, we're going to be up in '17 more than 50% versus '15. We have very, very strong technology position with world-class electron optics and very strong customer pull for e-beam products in logic, foundry and repeat orders for the PROVision in memory with some large customers. So very, very strong position. We have great technology, very strong customer pull and we believe that we're going to continue the growth that we've seen over the last couple of years in our PDC business. Michael Sullivan Great. Well, thanks, Harlan, for the question. And Bob, would you like to add anything else before we close the call? Robert Halliday Sure. Thanks, Mike. One of Gary's favorite expressions around here is innovation's about connecting the dots. Let me see if I connect a few dots that I -- we believe and I hope you heard today. One, we believe the wafer fab equipment market is sustainably higher and less volatile. Also, display is higher and for Applied, it's sustainably a better market because there are more technology inflections and because we're growing our served market. Second, Applied's position in the market is sustainably stronger. And we're executing better and better. And third, we're generating more free cash flow and returning the excess to our shareholders. Speaking of free cash flow, one of your own interesting note comparing Applied Materials to some of the top names in the industrial sector. Relative to the average of the companies, Applied has higher revenue and profit growth along with higher ROIC and free cash flow margins. Compared to these companies, I believe we're being discounted for being more cyclical even as we become demonstrably less cyclical. I believe that over time, we'll be viewed and valued in a new way. So thank you for your time today. And we look forward to seeing many of you in person over the next few weeks. Michael Sullivan Well, great. Thanks, Bob. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon. A replay of the call is going to be available on the website beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific Time today. And we thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, you may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day.

My name is Derek, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's first quarter financial results conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc. Thanks, Derek, and good afternoon, everybody. So first of all, thank you for taking the time to participate in our conference call today to review our operating performance for the first quarter of 2017. Before we begin, I would like to extend a warm welcome to those who are new in their coverage of Amgen, including Umer Raffat of ISI Evercore and Carter Gould of UBS. Each of us very much look forward to working with you. We made a lot of progress during the quarter both in our commercial execution as well as our R&D efforts, so I'm anxious to get started. I would urge you to listen for specific themes, including volume-driven growth and operational expense management as you hear our senior leaders describe our performance. Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will lead the call today with a brief report on how we are executing against our long-term strategy for growth. Following Bob, our CFO, David Meline, will review our financial results for the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2017. Our head of Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will then discuss our product performance during the quarter, followed by our head of R&D, Sean Harper, who will provide a pipeline update. And I'll give you a heads-up right now that we have a lot to discuss on our R&D efforts. As is customary for us, we will use slides for our presentation today, which have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail. We plan on using non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation to provide information which may be useful in understanding our ongoing business performance. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with GAAP results, and reconciliations of these measures are available in the schedules accompanying today's press release on Form 8-K and also on the Investor Relations section of our website. Just a reminder that some of the statements made during the course of our presentation today are forward-looking statements, and our 2016 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Okay, thank you, Arvind, and thank you all for joining our call. It's been an active first quarter at Amgen. And before talking about our financial results, I want to put the events of the first 90 days of the year in context because I think they underscore the reasons why we're confident about achieving our long-term objectives for growth. As you know, we're focused on six therapeutic categories. And during the quarter, we achieved important milestones in each of them. Core to our strategy is a commitment to differentiated innovation. We aim for products with a big effect size in areas where the unmet need is high. That's what we feel will be required to succeed over the long term in this industry. In our cardiovascular portfolio, we strongly believe Repatha represents one such product. As all of you know, cardiovascular disease poses by far the biggest health burden on society today. And our outcomes data demonstrated unequivocally that Repatha can play an important role in reducing that burden. And the data also showed to my mind that the rate of cardiovascular events, which approached 10% per year in the optimized statin arm of the trial, is still far too high without Repatha. Against this backdrop, we expect Repatha to be an important product in the fight against cardiovascular disease and increasingly expect physicians, patients, and other stakeholders to recognize that rejecting an innovative drug for high-risk patients which demonstrated beyond 12 months a 35% reduction in the risk of heart attack, a 24% reduction in the rate of stroke, and a 28% reduction in the rate of revascularizations is simply inappropriate. The practice of medicine won't change overnight but it won't stall either, not in the face of an innovative new therapy that can prevent hundreds of thousands of otherwise needless and tragic events. In the U.S. alone, cardiovascular disease costs our society in excess of $600 billion a year. And without meaningful innovation like Repatha to change the trajectory of this disease, those costs will exceed $1.2 trillion by 2035. We believe it's right to embrace innovation not only for patients but also for society. Economic study after study has shown that society benefits financially from adopting therapies like Repatha. Nonetheless, we recognize the access challenges of the day, and that's why we have and will continue to offer innovative value-based contracts to help build a bridge between the medical need and the affordability concerns for patients and payers. In addition to novel biology, intellectual property is another source of differentiation for our innovation. We were obviously gratified this quarter by the Delaware court's support for our position on Repatha, and we now stand ready for the Appeals Court to hear the case in June. In oncology, there's no better standard for differentiated innovation than achieving an overall survival advantage for patients. In the first quarter, we achieved that with both KYPROLIS and BLINCYTO. The BLINCYTO results are encouraging for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia obviously. But more broadly, they are encouraging as validation for the whole approach of our immuno-oncology BiTE platform. Perhaps because we are the only company with an advanced BiTE platform, this area is not as well understood in the investment community as other areas of immuno-oncology, but we're excited about the potential of our BiTEs and have several programs moving swiftly in our pipeline. We look forward to sharing data as they become available from these efforts. The overall survival data for KYPROLIS achieved at an interim analysis in relapsed multiple myeloma patients are also very important and timely. Having established superiority versus Velcade, we expect these data will drive increased share for KYPROLIS, particularly in the second line, and will also be helpful for reimbursement considerations. Also in multiple myeloma this quarter, we achieved positive results for XGEVA. And subject to regulatory approvals, we look forward to being able to offer this therapy to multiple myeloma patients, many of whom are at risk of skeletal-related events such as those prevented by XGEVA. Bone health remains an area of high unmet medical need, as still millions of women at high risk for postmenopausal fractures remain untreated. Reflecting on the number of postmenopausal fractures, the World Health Organization called this a global epidemic. Prolia's ongoing significant volume-driven growth, 21% in the quarter, attests to the value of differentiated innovation in this field. Already the leader in bone health, we expect EVENITY will strengthen our hand. And while we await both further clinical data and regulatory reviews, Sean will describe the encouraging results that we received this quarter for the three-year follow-up from the FRAME study. While discussing our strategy of differentiated innovation, I also want to address our newest therapeutic area, which is of course neuroscience, where we are on the threshold of a novel first-in-class therapy for migraine sufferers. We had the opportunity to present our registration-enabling data at the American Academy of Neurology this week. And not surprisingly, experts in the field were excited about erenumab in an area where there is otherwise precious little to offer those suffering from episodic and chronic migraine. I've seen some headlines asking whether our expanded collaboration with Novartis signals a waning of our enthusiasm for this opportunity. The answer is absolutely not. We have high hopes for erenumab. And at the same time, we recognize this is a new therapeutic category for us and will likely be a competitive race. So we were very pleased that Novartis, already our collaborator in international markets, shared our enthusiasm for this first-in-class molecule in the U.S. and our determination to resource this product to win. With their decades of experience in neurology and a shared commitment to serve those suffering from migraine, we're excited about our expanded collaboration. When it comes to strategy, you've also heard us talk about life cycle management, especially for our legacy franchises. The Neulasta Onpro launch is now widely seen as one of the most effective examples of this, with market shares now in excess of 50% in the U.S. In nephrology, we announced earlier this quarter an extension of our partnership with DaVita for EPOGEN. And of course, we also gained approval for Parsabiv in the U.S. As the established leader in nephrology therapeutics, we continue to look for ways to serve patients with kidney disease and expect this to remain an important franchise for us. As you know, an element of our strategy includes developing a portfolio of biosimilars, and I'm glad that we made that commitment, as I think there will be a robust market for these products. And while our portfolio of 10 biosimilars is progressing across the board, the highlight for the quarter was in inflammation, where we received EU approval to go along with our U.S. approval of AMGEVITA, our biosimilar to Humira. The first steps in building out this business are to establish biosimilarity and gain registration, and obviously we have done that now for an important molecule in the biggest markets. The next step is to navigate the IP landscape, and the process for that is underway. Over the past couple of years, we've talked on these calls about our ongoing transformation efforts. We committed to a companywide transformation, real, meaningful change designed to make us more competitive, improve our operating margins, and ensure that we would be in a strong position to return capital to our shareholders during this period of increasing competition for our legacy franchises and while launching nine innovative products, maintaining our investment in innovation, advancing our biosimilars portfolio, and expanding our international presence from 50 to over 100 countries. We have asked a lot of our staff, and they have delivered. In our past results, you've seen our steady progress, and you see it once again this quarter, where our margins have grown and we delivered 9% earnings per share growth. Looking forward, our orientation is long-term growth with volume-driven products, and we think we can deliver that across our focused therapeutic franchises. But we're also set on managing the business tightly to deliver in the short and medium term too. You should see this in our track record, and that's what you see in this quarter as well. Our balance sheet and cash flows are strong, and we're looking for investment opportunities, albeit with a determination to add value for our shareholders, not just someone else's. Given valuations across many targets in the sector at the moment, that's challenging, but we'll remain patient and discriminating when it comes to M&A. We've long advocated the need for corporate tax reform. If innovative U.S. companies are to remain competitive, we need a level tax playing field. We don't have one now, but we're hopeful this administration will deliver that in 2017. Obviously, we think such change would improve our flexibility for capital allocation. I've taken a bit longer than usual on this call, but with all of the events of the first quarter, I wanted to make sure to reiterate that we're investing in long-term opportunities, managing the business tightly, and are poised to capitalize on investment opportunities which might arise. With that, let me once again thank our staff for their engagement with our mission, and then turn to David. Thank you. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc. Okay. Thanks, Bob. We were pleased with our solid overall results and earnings growth again in the first quarter, as our transformation efforts enabled progress in an environment of strong competition and portfolio transition. We also were encouraged by our 7% volume growth in Europe, reflecting the value of our innovative products in a market where we have experienced similar competition and portfolio transition for a number of years. Turning to the financial results on page 6 of the slide deck, worldwide revenues at $5.5 billion in the first quarter are flat year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange and are 1% lower on a reported basis including FX. Worldwide product sales at $5.2 billion in the first quarter are flat year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange and are 1% lower on a reported basis including FX, as strong unit demand for our newer products was offset by declines in our mature brands. Other revenues at $265 million decreased $23 million versus the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP operating income at $3 billion grew 5% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin improved by 3 points to 57.6% for the quarter, reflecting continued favorable expense impacts from our transformation initiatives across all operating expense categories and the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payments in Q4 of 2016. As in prior years, our operating margin is expected to be lower in the remaining quarters of the year, driven by the timing of expenses. On an overall full-year basis, we expect another year of strong operating margins, driven by tight operational expense management. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales improved by 0.4 points to 13.1%, driven by manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by product mix. Research and development expenses at $748 million were down 13% year over year, driven by a first quarter 2016 payment related to a third-party collaboration agreement, lower spending required to support certain later-stage clinical programs, and continued benefits from our transformation initiatives. Research and development as a percent of product sales at 14.4% is lower in Q1, consistent with previous years. Going forward, research and development expense as a percent of product sales is expected to normalize around 2016 levels. SG&A expenses decreased 6% on a year-over-year basis due to the expiry of the Enbrel residual royalty payments, partially offset by increased investments in new product launches. In aggregate, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 7% year over year and remain on track to meet or exceed our 2018 commitment of $1.5 billion in transformation savings, while investing to build the business globally, support new product launches, and invest in the long-term pipeline for the business. Other income and expenses were a net $131 million expense in Q1. This is favorable by $13 million on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by higher cash balances. The non-GAAP tax rate was 18.5% for the quarter, a 0.4-point decrease versus the first quarter of 2016. This decrease reflects favorable changes in the geographic mix of earnings, partially offset by a smaller benefit from share-based compensation tax expenses compared to the first quarter of last year. As you may recall, this benefit is a result of the adoption of Accounting Standard Update 2016-9, requiring these tax impacts to be recognized on the income statement versus the balance sheet. The benefit of this adoption contributed approximately $0.06 to our non-GAAP earnings per share in this quarter compared to $0.09 in the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income increased 6%, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 9% year over year for the first quarter to $3.15 per share. Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page 7, free cash flow was $2.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of $400 million over last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher profitability as well as timing impacts of income tax payments to the IRS. We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders, consistent with our commitments, as we deployed $0.6 billion to repurchase 3.4 million shares at an average of $163 per share, and are on track to achieve total share repurchase for this year in the range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion, as previously communicated. Additionally, our first quarter dividend increased to $1.15 per share, an increase of 15% over last year. Cash and investments totaled $38.4 billion, an increase of approximately $3.7 billion from the first quarter of last year. This increase reflects continued solid net cash flow generation. Our debt balance stands at $34.1 billion as of March 31, carrying a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% and an average maturity of 12 years. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2017 on page 8, overall our 2017 revenue guidance remains unchanged at $22.3 billion to $23.1 billion. Our first quarter volume and price performance was in line with our plans, as we experienced a solid contribution from our newer products while managing the impact of competition against the balance of the portfolio. Revenue guidance also reflects the potential impact of the Repatha litigation and improving access for appropriate patients as a result of the positive Repatha cardiovascular outcomes data. Finally, our guidance takes into account potential biosimilar competition against Neulasta commencing as soon as the fourth quarter of this year. With regard to our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we are raising the outlook to $12.00 to $12.60, reflecting our overall solid Q1 performance. In addition, our non-GAAP tax rate guidance remains unchanged at 18.5% to 19.5%, and we expect capital expenditures of approximately $700 million this year. As previously stated, our 2017 guidance ranges are based on application of existing laws, including the Affordable Care Act and the current U.S. tax code as well as current interpretation of the required notice period prior to commercial marketing of a biosimilar under the BPCIA [Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act]. We will continue to update guidance going forward for changes in these factors and any other business updates. Finally, consistent with our 2017 outlook, we remain confident we will meet or exceed the commitments provided for the 2014 to 2018 period, including: double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth; non-GAAP operating margin improvement from 38% to 52% to 54%; $1.5 billion of transformation savings; and return to shareholders of at least 60% of non-GAAP net income on average during the period. This concludes the financial update. I now turn the call over to Tony. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. You'll find our product sales starting on slide number 10. Our business performance is shifting to a more volume-driven growth as we launch innovative products targeting the large patient populations with unmet medical needs. Whilst our focus is on innovation, we have also executed effective life cycle management strategies for some of our legacy brands which are facing potential new competition. Although U.S. revenues declined 1%, our ex-U.S. growth was 3%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, fueled by a 7% volume growth. I'll now discuss our specific product performance and will structure my comments by therapeutic area. Let me begin with our bone health franchise. Prolia is a great example of one of our innovative products that realized robust volume growth during the quarter, with most of its 21% year-over-year sales growth driven by unit volume. Prolia, with a strong value proposition, is uniquely positioned in postmenopausal osteoporosis as the leading branded product on the market. We will continue to invest in Prolia to reach a greater number of patients whilst reinforcing adherence for those already taking Prolia to ensure they continue to realize its benefits. Overall, we expect Prolia will remain a significant growth driver, as the approximately 850,000 U.S. patients on Prolia therapy only represent about 20% of patients presently being treated for postmenopausal osteoporosis. We also look forward to expanding our bone health franchise with romosozumab, our innovative bone-building molecule for which we now have a trade name, EVENITY. In conjunction with our partners at UCB, we're preparing for a U.S. launch in advance of the July 19 PDUFA date. As Bob pointed out, having the ability to co-position EVENITY and Prolia sequentially will improve our ability to better treat those large patient populations. For thousands of high-risk postmenopausal osteoporosis patients such as those who have fractured, we have a proven therapeutic strategy with EVENITY to first build strong new bone in patients with 12 months of treatment, followed by Prolia for proven continued fracture risk reduction. Oncology is another area that is benefiting from volume growth with our recently launched products. Let me start with KYPROLIS. KYPROLIS realized 23% year-on-year growth during the quarter. And most of this growth was volume-driven, including our international markets. As you know, KYPROLIS is indicated in the U.S. for second and third-line multiple myeloma. In second-line, triplet regimens are used in approximately one-third of patients. And despite new entrants, we've been able to achieve about 50% market share for new patient starts in this segment. The other two-thirds of second-line patients are treated with doublet regimens. And recent data from our ENDEAVOR study had demonstrated that KYPROLIS plus dexamethasone improved overall survival by 21% or nearly 8 months when compared to the Velcade plus dexamethasone. Improving overall survival is the gold standard measurement when treating cancer. This data clearly establishes KYPROLIS as the proteasome inhibitor of choice and will be a compelling differentiator in our strategy to displace Velcade in this setting. KYPROLIS is well accepted in large academic centers that treat high numbers of multiple myeloma patients. And we are now focusing on extending KYPROLIS's reach into the community oncology practices. Despite the introduction of new competing products in the U.S., we have also regained share in new third-line patients over the last few quarters. We expect proteasome inhibition to be foundational therapy in multiple myeloma for many years to come and are focused on growing in second and third lines of therapy with plans to expand KYPROLIS's use in newly diagnosed patients. Outside the U.S., we continue to enter into new markets and secure reimbursement with the benefit of the new KYPROLIS overall survival data. XGEVA grew 6% year over year, mostly due to volume, as we continue to emphasize its clinical benefits. We look forward to having the positive multiple myeloma study data added to our label. This will expand the patient population eligible for XGEVA treatment. Both Nplate and Vectibix saw another good quarter of volume growth of 9% and 6% respectively. Neulasta sales increased 2% year over year, as we continue to see a small decline in the use of myelosuppressive chemotherapeutic agents. The first quarter also benefited from accounting estimate changes due to lower Onpro returns, underscoring that Onpro delivery is working better than initially assumed. We continue to drive increasing adoption, and Onpro now represents over 50% share of all Neulasta purchases. This has been a great example of a very successful life cycle management strategy. And as David explained earlier, we expect minimal impact in 2017 from potential long-acting biosimilar competition. I'd also note that the first quarter historically benefits from heavier purchasing by certain end customers, and we estimate this benefit in quarter one to be about $50 million, which we expect to reverse in quarter two. For NEUPOGEN, the impact of competition was in line with prior performance. We entered the quarter retaining a 46% share of the short-acting market in the U.S. We expect these competitive dynamics to continue over the course of 2017. Moving now to Enbrel, I would start by emphasizing that we see no trend break versus 2016. And I will go through Enbrel carefully and in some detail because I don't want you to misinterpret long-term dynamics based on some quarter one peculiarities. Before getting into quarterly performance, I'd like to highlight that we utilize IMS prescription data to analyze the business. Like many of you, we noticed a slowdown in the first quarter IMS scripts. This has implications for our views on segment demand and end-user inventory levels. We've been in close contact with IMS, and they agree that the first quarter prescription data appears soft in several specialty product categories, including rheumatology and dermatology. As a matter of fact, on a year-over-year basis, unit growth in rheumatology appeared to slow from 9% in the first quarter of 2016 to 2% in this quarter, and from 25% to 9% in the dermatology segment for the same period. IMS attributes the softness to a combination of several factors, including the number of shipping days in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus the first quarter of 2017, the impact of patient out-of-pocket costs including deductibles, and the Part D donut hole for the start of a new year, as well as the potential increasing use of 90-day prescriptions. This is also consistent with our view of the market. We noted our expectations that 2016 trends would continue into 2017. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, our share declined 1 percentage point to 32% in rheumatology and declined 2 percentage points in dermatology to 15%, in line with 2016 share trends. As for the end-user inventory, we previously said that we expected quarter one reductions due to the quarter four 2016 $150 million excess inventory. Based on the IMS data, we calculated an approximate $30 million reduction in inventory levels this quarter. And therefore, we expect the remainder to be used up during the course of the year. Obviously, the accuracy of the IMS data has implications for understanding of both unit demand dynamics and end-user inventory. Consistent with our previous guidance, net selling price had a minimal impact on year-over-year sales growth during quarter one. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, we are seeing increased commercial patient copay assistance impacting their selling price, which is likely a function of higher patient out-of-pocket costs. This impact typically tapers off over the remainder of the year, and our view on net selling price in 2017 is unchanged. We are optimistic about a rebound in both Enbrel and Enbrel segment growth in future quarters, as IMS prescription data from the more recent weeks shows improvement versus the beginning of the year in both rheumatology and dermatology. So in summary, the quarter one results likely reflect a temporary marketplace issue, and we believe the long-term dynamics are intact and in line with our prior expectations. There remain a substantial number of patients for which Enbrel is the best treatment option given its competitive efficacy and long-term safety profile. We will continue to invest in Enbrel to enhance its value it brings to patients and providers. Given its long-term period of patent protection, Enbrel will continue to be a significant cash flow generator for Amgen for many years to come. Turning now to our nephrology products, beginning with Aranesp, on a worldwide basis, Aranesp declined 4% year over year. In the U.S., it increased by 7%, including the conversion from EPOGEN at numerous independent and midsize dialysis centers. This conversion was substantially completed by quarter three of 2016, with Aranesp now representing over 85% of the ESA usage. Performance outside the U.S. was negatively impacted by foreign exchange as well as the timing of tenders in certain markets. Now to EPOGEN, as previously disclosed, we recently renegotiated our supply agreement with DaVita. DaVita represents about one-third of the U.S. dialysis market, and they will continue to predominantly purchase EPOGEN through 2022. In exchange for longer supply certainty, we made concessions on net selling prices, which impacted the quarter-on-quarter results. Also, as David mentioned, we do not expect a material impact to our ESA business in 2017 from a short-acting biosimilar competitor. Sensipar increased 15% year over year, driven by a combination of net selling price and volume growth. Parsabiv, our innovative new cosmetic, delivered intravenously, is now approved in both the U.S. and Europe. And we are working with CMS to secure a reimbursement mechanism in the U.S. Let me now turn to our cardiovascular franchise and Repatha. Let me first address the quarter-on-quarter growth, which might look a little strange. Quarter four 2016 was slightly inflated due to the booking of a Middle East tender, which was not repeated in quarter one this year. With closer examination of the data, you will see that we recorded positive volume growth in the U.S. of 14% and 28% in Europe. In the U.S., we achieved segment share of 64% in quarter one for new-to-brand patients and briefly touched on 70% as we exited the quarter. In Europe, we exited 2016 with 56% segment share. Our U.S. formulary coverage has greatly improved over last year, especially in Medicare Part D, where we have almost tripled the number of lives covered. Results of the Repatha cardiovascular outcomes study that were presented at the American College of Cardiology last month are clearly a game-changer for cardiovascular patients, showing significant reductions in MIs and strokes. We also shared our analysis on the economic value of Repatha at the ACC. This calculation used standard peer-reviewed methodology, using real-world event rates and imputed mortality benefit from the meta-analysis of previous studies, the CTTC relationship, and concluded that prices in the market today are well within the value-based price range. Naturally, this calculation is based on average net selling price and not the list price. Since the ACC, we've been engaging with payers in the U.S. and across the world on Repatha's clinical data and economic value. We are in active discussions with all of the large U.S. PBMs and payers, and they recognize the importance of Repatha's outcome data to patients. We are focused on reducing barriers and improving processes to make it easier for a physician to prescribe Repatha and for patients to get access to this important therapy. We expect payers will start changing utilization management criteria and processes over the coming months. Several independent groups have studied the access situation and have concluded that current access barriers are inappropriate and potentially harmful to patients. As pointed out in the recent publication by the Partnership for Health Analytic Research, or PHAR, it started with the irresponsible prediction of healthcare costs prior to FDA approval of the PCSK9 inhibitor class. These overestimates resulted in onerous restrictions and lack of patient access from the beginning. At the ACC last month, two research teams, including one from Duke, presented data showing that patients' clinical characteristics were no different between those denied reimbursement for PCSK9 versus those approved, showing that payer utilization management processes were nothing but an arbitrary barrier to access. And just today, the FH Foundation published a peer-reviewed paper in the journal Circulation showing that 63% of FH patients and 58% of established ASCVD patients had their PCSK9 inhibitor claims rejected despite having suboptimal LDL-C levels and being on moderate or high-intensity statins. Cardiovascular disease continues to be the number-one cause of death and disability in the world. And in a moment, Sean will remind us of the incredible outcome value that Repatha has demonstrated by its ability to reduce both MI and stroke. This data together with the groundswell of cardiology and patient pressure will result in increasing levels of patient access. Repatha will continue to grow for many years to come, making it one of the largest innovative assets Amgen has brought to market. Let me conclude by saying a few words about erenumab and our recently announced expanded collaboration with Novartis. We believe that partnering with Novartis, a company that is well-positioned in the neuroscience space, will enable us to maximize the launch of this first-in-class product. We believe that erenumab will offer a strong value proposition to millions of patients suffering from chronic or episodic migraines. Let me close by thanking all the Amgen staff that worked so hard and tirelessly to get our important products to patients around the world. Sean? Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. I'll begin my comments today with Repatha. As you know, we presented the results of our Repatha cardiovascular outcomes study at the American College of Cardiology meetings in March with simultaneous publication in The New England Journal of Medicine. This represented a major step on the path of getting this therapy to the patients who so desperately need it. The study had several objectives: first, to validate the PCSK9 mechanism with respect to cardiovascular outcomes; second, to establish the safety of reaching unprecedented low LDL levels, recall that 25% of patients in the Repatha arm had on-treatment LDLs below 19; and third, to understand whether the linear relationship established by statins and ezetimibe between LDL and cardiovascular risk continues down to very low LDL levels, as the human genetics had suggested. This study gave clear positive results on all of these objectives. The results also validated our dosing approach of maximally inhibiting PCSK9 with Repatha, and that when it comes to LDL, as we began to hear cardiologists coin at the ACC, lowest is best. Importantly, outcomes data from Pfizer's discontinued PCSK9 program were presented and also published in The New England Journal of Medicine, confirming the efficacy seen in our study and demonstrating that not all PCSK9 antibody therapies are the same with respect to off-target liabilities. Now there's been a fair amount of speculation in the press and elsewhere about the magnitude of the risk reduction observed in our study, so I'm going to spend a bit of time on the results. We have found that the vast preponderance of experts in this field view this study as highly successful in terms of the observed effect size. Essentially, the results are exactly as what would have been achieved had one been able to reduce LDL to the same degree with additional statin therapy were it possible to do so without unacceptable toxicity. Specifically, experts understand that the treatment lag that occurs in the first year of therapy, a phenomenon seen in all lipid-lowering trials in this type of population, represented a much larger proportion of the median time on therapy in our study, which was just over two years, versus the average 5.5-year-long statin study. They also understand that adjusting appropriately for duration of therapy, the results line up extremely well with the cholesterol treatment trial as a collaboration or CTTC meta analyses. When one looks at the pre-specified landmark analyses for this chronic therapy, after the first year when the treatment lag is over and the true chronic value of the therapy can be assessed accurately, the risk reductions in myocardial infarction 35%, stroke 24%, and revascularization 28% are quite impressive, particularly in the setting of such a remarkably clean safety profile. Experts also understand why one should not have anticipated an impact on CV mortality in such a study, and I would refer those who are interested to an excellent editorial on this subject published recently in the Journal of Clinical Lipidology. And to just remind us of the clinical reality here, many millions of patients like those in our outcome studies have a high annual risk of CV events, despite maximally tolerated statins, and have no other therapeutic alternative to take their LDLs down to levels that significantly protect them from such events. In fact, we were all surprised by the fact that despite optimized therapy with best standard of care, including high-intensity statins, patients in the placebo arm of our CV outcome study had an annual event rate of almost 10%, which clearly demonstrates the unmet need here, as event rates in the real world are significantly higher than those seen in clinical trial settings. Now one of our highest priorities is to ensure these results are reflected in the Repatha label as soon as possible, and we're targeting regulatory submissions by midyear. I'd also note that the Repatha 420-milligram single-dose delivery option was recently approved in Europe. Turning to oncology, we completed XGEVA regulatory submissions in the U.S. and Europe for the prevention of skeletal-related events in multiple myeloma patients, providing a potential new treatment option for patients, many of whom are not able to avail themselves of alternative therapies due to renal insufficiency. In multiple myeloma, we received the overall survival data from the ENDEAVOR study in relapsed or refractory patients, which confirm the superiority of KYPROLIS plus dexamethasone over Velcade plus dexamethasone. In fact, ENDEAVOR was the first head-to-head study to demonstrate a survival benefit versus a current standard-of-care regimen in this setting, and we're preparing to submit these results to regulators as well. We also remain on track to begin enrollment this quarter in our Phase 3 study of KYPROLIS in combination with DARZALEX in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, and also recently began enrolling a Phase 1b study of new formulations of oprozomib. Turning to our immuno-oncology programs, I'll begin with our BiTE platform. We were very pleased that FDA granted BLINCYTO Priority Review for our recent sBLA that includes overall survival data from our Phase 3 study to support conversion from accelerated to full approval. The application also includes new data in Philadelphia chromosome-positive relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a small population but an area of significant unmet need. We also continued to roll out our Phase 2/3 BLINCYTO program in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the most common form of high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We also had the opportunity in the recent American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting to present preclinical data from some of our new BiTE programs, including half-life extended constructs. We continue to make good progress with the investigation of Enlogic in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, and we'll be presenting the results of our Phase 2 study in combination with Yervoy at ASCO as well as some very interesting human biomarker data at the Congress of the European Association of Dermato Oncology. Finally, in the early-stage immuno-oncology pipeline, we're making progress on our Advaxis collaboration and have an investigational new drug application in place for a personalized neo-antigen-targeted approach to cancer immunotherapy. In our bone therapeutic area, our collaboration with UCB on EVENITY continues to advance, and we look forward to our July U.S. PDUFA date for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture. Ahead of this, we expect the primary analysis of our active controlled fracture study, ARCH, in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in the near future. I will remind you that the upcoming primary analysis will include the clinical fracture and vertebral fracture primary co-endpoints as well as an interim analysis of the event-driven non-vertebral fracture study secondary endpoint. If statistical significance is not achieved at this interim analysis, the study will continue until the final analysis some months later. We designed ARCH in this manner to ensure adequate powering at the non-vertebral fracture endpoint. I would also point out that compared to the placebo-controlled FRAME study, the ARCH study compares EVENITY followed by alendronate to antiresorptive therapy with alendronate throughout the study period. These sequences are being assessed in a higher-risk population than our FRAME study, with all subjects in ARCH required to have prevalent fracture. This was possible given the active comparator design, and we were not exposing these higher-risk patients to placebo. If you recall in the FRAME study, the event rate for non-vertebral fractures was much lower than expected. And at 12 months, the non-vertebral relative risk reduction was 25% in the EVENITY-treated patients but was not significantly significant. In an exploratory analysis reported at ASBMR [American Society for Bone and Mineral Research], the relative risk reduction at two years in FRAME was 25% with a nominal T-value that was less than 0.05. We recently conducted the three-year analysis of this study, which again demonstrated nominal significance for non-vertebral fracture, demonstrating that a year of EVENITY therapy still had high treatment impact through year three, despite the fact that the control group received a very potent antiresorptive agent, Prolia, in years two and three. Within our neuroscience collaboration with Novartis, we had the opportunity to present the results from our two Phase 3 erenumab studies in episodic migraine at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting yesterday. The data demonstrated the robust and consistent effect of inhibiting the CGRP receptor with erenumab. And feedback from experts at the meeting have been very positive, with many viewing this as a potentially game-changing therapy for a debilitating, highly symptomatic disease. We look forward to making first-in-class regulatory submissions for erenumab that incorporate our episodic and chronic data later this quarter. AMG 301, our PAC-1 antibody for migraine, also continues to progress. We've seen encouraging pharmacodynamic activity in our Phase 1 study in normal subjects and are currently designing a Phase 2 program in migraineurs, which we expect to begin later this year. Also in the quarter, Phase 3 enrollment in Alzheimer's disease began for the small molecule BACE inhibitor, AMG 520, we are developing with Novartis. In our inflammation collaboration with AstraZeneca-MedImmune, I am pleased to provide a program update for AMG 157 or tezepelumab, our monoclonal antibody that inhibits thymic stromal lymphopoietin or TSLP. TSLP is an epithelial-derived cytokine produced in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli that drives inflammatory responses. TSLP expression is increased in the airways of patients with asthma, the magnitude correlating with the severity of disease. Some of you may recall that our Phase 1b data were quite compelling and were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2014. Together with AZ-MedImmune, we've now received the results from a large double-blind Phase 2b study in patients with inadequately controlled severe asthma in which AMG 157 demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations compared to placebo at 52 weeks, successfully meeting the primary endpoint. This is a very encouraging result. And together with AZ-MedImmune, we are currently evaluating the potential for this agent to address a broad population of patients with severe asthma. Briefly in nephrology, in the first quarter we also received approval for Parsabiv, our innovative IV calcimimetic that is administered thrice weekly at the end of dialysis for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease. And lastly in biosimilar news from Europe, we received approval for AMGEVITA, our biosimilar Humira, for all available indications and submitted ABP 980, our biosimilar Herceptin, for approval. In closing, I'd like to acknowledge our staff for advancing these important programs on behalf of patients. Bob? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Okay, thank you, Sean. I know we've taken more time than usual on our introductory remarks, so let's go straight to questions, Derek, and just please remind our callers of the process for the next step. Question-and-Answer Session Operator And your first question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence, begin your question. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi, thanks for taking the question, maybe just a two-part on Repatha. First, Tony, can you comment if the payers appreciate the details of the four-year data that Sean walked through? And then it looks like net price might have taken a step down in the U.S. in the first quarter. I'm just wondering if you can confirm that and any additional commentary that you can provide. Thank you. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Terence, sure. All our discussions with the payers have been really starting with the discussion on the Repatha outcomes data, and I don't think we've had any pushback at all in terms of people really understanding the robust value. We will continue to work with them. Obviously, each one of them has agreed to go back and relook at the utilization management criteria as we speak. There does appear to be a slight adjustment in the net price. One was due to a small accounting adjustment. And two, of course, we book our patient copay program to the net price, and the first quarter is normally a lot higher than second, third, or fourth. So we see that normalizing as we go forward. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Can we go to the next question? Operator And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew, you may begin your question. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great, thanks for taking the question. Tony, thanks for the detail on Enbrel. I'm sure, as you appreciate, there's a lot of questions that people have on that. If I can just ask two points there, you cited a market slowdown which you think will improve throughout the rest of the year. Could you just talk about your confidence around that? And beyond some of the weekly data points, are there other reasons to believe that broadly the market is not slowing? And then second, it seems to me that the impact on price in the first quarter is higher than you've seen in quarters past, even when thinking about copay assistance and some of the other factors. Is there anything else going on there, and what's your confidence about price leveling out for the year? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Thanks, Matt. So as you know, with Enbrel as a retail product, about 97% of the volume is reported on a script basis, so we can track it quite tightly. For the quarter, it was definitely down, both rheumatology and dermatology. When I look at it sequentially, January, February, March, and then as I see it going into April, each one of those months has shown an incremental growth both in terms of DOT as well as prescriptions and in terms of growth. So January was down a lot. February was better than January. March was better than February, and April is starting to look much better than March as well. From a net price, we don't see a dramatic change in the net price. Some the new contracts are coming into place, but our outlook on net price for 2017 hasn't changed at all. And when I look at abandonment rates, abandonment rates in the first quarter are pretty similar for Enbrel to what they were in the fourth quarter or the third quarter last year. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. And, Matthew, maybe just big picture here, when we look at the flow of patients into the information space, particularly rheumatology and dermatology, we see no reason in the marketplace that the trend of an increasing number of patients into this therapy would have abruptly changed between the fourth and the first quarter. So we think that we'll continue to see growth in the underlying demand for these kind of products. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ying, you may begin your question. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on Repatha. How much have you heard from the physicians in terms of feedback that they have to wait for a treatment guideline change by, let's say, ACC or AHA before they start prescribing more Repatha? And if that's the case, when do you think those professional organizations will change the guideline? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. I think it's probably a subtle question that you're asking there, Ying, so why don't we just take a moment and really step through it. Tony, why don't you go ahead and take the first go. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. So all our discussions with cardiologists have been around their frustration of the administrative burden that has been placed upon them to get a prescription for appropriate patients. A lot of them are having to hire full-time nurses to spend the entire day chasing down required patient data, to chase down interactions between the patient or between the physician and the respective payer or the PBM. The guidelines themselves clearly in everyone's mind would help move the decision-making and the utilization criteria a bit quicker. But our major conversation with physicians is not really around the guidelines; it's more around the inconvenience. From a guideline perspective, clearly both the AHA and the ACC are busy looking at the outcomes data. They've told us they're busy identifying position papers they wish to put forward. The NLA, the National Lipid Association, was there. The Association of Preventive Cardiology (sic) [American Society of Preventive Cardiology] (54:25), run by Dr. Seth Baum, is in the process of looking at a revised set of guidelines, including a proposed set of utilization management criteria, which they're proposing the PBMs and the payers should be using. In terms of guidelines themselves, both the AHA and the ACC have said it will take some time before they actually get to a final guideline change. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. I think the important information here is that the data demonstrated that lower is better, or as Sean said and as we increasingly hear from experts in the field, lowest is best. And I think people recognize that the current guidelines are out of sync with that. So the data make the point clear, and we expect to see white papers and then ultimately changes in the guidelines. But for right now, the data are an important piece of getting people to understand how to manage this disease for patients. Let's go to the next question. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen. Eric, you may begin your question. Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC Thanks. Just as a follow-on to Ying's question, it sounds like the major bottleneck is this hassle factor, Tony, that physicians are being put through, and I guess I'm just wondering what kind of leverage Amgen has to reduce that factor. Can't payers just stay entrenched and say our policies are that we'll cover it, but we're going to make you go through X, Y, and Z hoops and maintain the hassle factor and I guess the evidence of better medicine? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. So, Eric, I don't think I've spoken to a single cardiologist or general practitioner who hasn't commented on how onerous the process is to gain access to these products. I think without a doubt, the third-party organizations, the professional organizations such as the ACC, the AHA, as well as patient organizations such as the FH Foundation are the ones who are running the research work at the moment, including Duke, as I said. We actually looked at those patients who received a PCSK9 and those who didn't, and actually show there's no clinical difference in the patients themselves. This type of burden I think is going to start putting the pressure on the payers. Talking to the payers, they themselves are agreeing with us that the clinical data is important, and they need to expand access to appropriate patients. So we will continue to drive that interaction with them. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory, you may begin your question. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great, thanks for taking the question. Good afternoon. I have a pretty commercial question on erenumab. I wonder if you can comment on early interactions you're having with payers on that front or maybe just general market research for the product. I guess specifically, I'm wondering how much of an impediment you expect access to be in the early days of that pending launch and how much your research may have factored into the strategic decision to further engage with Novartis. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. So let me start, Cory, by just telling you about an interaction I had with my counterpart at Novartis yesterday. He and I have both been in recent contact with neurologists who specialize in treating patients with chronic migraine. And the two of us are quite elated at the level of excitement we're seeing amongst these physicians about having for the first time in decades a treatment opportunity to really help people who have this debilitating disease. It truly is one of those symptomatic diseases where if you've got a migraine, you really know about it, and it impacts how you run your life. Can you run your life or can you be a good caregiver? We are starting our discussions with the payers right now. We are helping them see the data from a clinical perspective. Obviously, the real negotiation can only start once we have the label, and we look forward to having that in the next couple months or so. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Josh, you may begin your question. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thanks for taking the question. If you can, help us understand the market segmentation in asthma, really the issue with AMG 157 again versus some of the other novel biologics targeting the IL4 side pathways (58:46). Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Okay. The question was a little bit hard to hear, Josh, but I think, Sean, why don't you take the first crack at it? Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes, what I would say is that it's still early days for a lot of the therapies that are still in development. But as you look across the biologics landscape in asthma, there's a few things that are clear. One is that in aggregate, asthma is an enormous opportunity from the perspective of the unmet need and the number of patients who are, for example, having to take courses of oral corticosteroids throughout the course of the year to manage their disease, which is very problematic for them. And I think what you're seeing is that many of the mechanisms that are either out there now in biologics or being developed currently are segmented to populations that, for example, have high eosinophilic counts, atopic phenotype, et cetera. And in the case of TSLP, what we like about TSLP is it is a very upstream kind of a mediator of this inflammation. And our expectation is that we could have a very broad impact on patients with activity across the spectrum of patient phenotypes within the asthma disease spectrum, which would make it a very attractive therapeutic option. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny, you may begin your question. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Good evening and thank you for taking my question. I guess the Supreme Court have been looking at the biosimilar law today. In the case they side with you and find that shall means will, can you give us a feel for what will happen with the biosimilars that have already launched for Neulasta? Will they have to come back into the full patent dance? Essentially, if you win this case, what does it mean in terms of delay of biosimilar Neulasta approvals or launches? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. I think there are a couple things in your question there, Ronny. Let me tease apart the two pieces of it. First, as you know, the Supreme Court reviewed this today, and so we'll know within a matter of weeks. Obviously, we think the 180-day needs to be enforced as it was written in the law. But with respect – I think you must have been referring to the short-acting competitors to NEUPOGEN. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC No, I was talking about the patent dance and impact of Neulasta biosimilar launches. Essentially, if you win that, will the biosimilar Neulasta be delayed? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. I guess I'm not sure what you mean by delayed. I think again, the big picture here, Ronny, is that we've known for some time that we'll face biosimilar competition. We're expecting that that will happen for Neulasta, and we're ready for that. You've seen the actions that we've been taking over the past couple years to be ready for that. And we're ready to embrace the competition, and we've positioned the company from an operating expense standpoint with the knowledge that that competition is coming, and we're launching medicines and entering markets that we think will help us grow beyond that. So the 180-day is obviously post-FDA approval, so we're watching different competitive products make their way through the regulatory pathway. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc. If I could then, in terms of the guidance we've offered, there are none that have been approved yet to compete with Neulasta. There's one that's lined up I think in the third quarter here. So if it were approved and the 180-day stands, then that would imply, as we've indicated, that we could face competition as soon as late this year, and that's how our guidance is built right now. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Yes. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Alethia, you may begin your question. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just again on Neulasta, I know Onpro is picking up momentum. But I'm just trying to figure out if you think – how do you think this helps defend you against biosimilar share? Is it as simple as that the market is remodeling itself, and so it delays and prolongs some of the competition that you may see, or is there some other dynamic we should be aware of? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Alethia, it's Tony. So let me go back to a comment I made on the last quarter earnings. Let's use MD Anderson as an example of probably one of the premier large oncology teaching centers in the country. It took MD Anderson almost – just over 12 months to go through their P&T committee to get an agreement within the institution to start shifting patients to Onpro. And the rationale was they were really having a good look at the clinical value, the treatment protocols, the discharge protocols, and they finally agreed that this product was certainly worthwhile having. We spent a number of weeks training their 600 oncology nurses so they were able to really identify the right patient, administer the drug before patients went home, and they have therefore changed the clinical practice. The feedback we get from both the oncology nurses, the oncologists themselves, and patients in fact about the fact they no longer have to come back 24 hours later or a day after their chemotherapy when they're in the middle of chemo-induced nausea and vomiting is a huge advantage and allows them a better quality of life. So we really believe that the benefit this drug brings is not simply a device. It is really something that allows patients to continue to live their lives whilst being treated for cancer. It also has resulted in changes, definitive changes in discharge protocols, which we think will take some time to be reversed if there's no other alternative. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Yes, it's worth keeping in mind the big picture here, Alethia. There's some data in a peer review publication from this week recognizing that there are 100,000 hospitalizations a year in this country from patients who suffer from an infection while undergoing chemotherapy, and of course that's what NEUPOGEN and Neulasta are designed to address. And any product like Onpro that can help prevent some number of those infections is an important product. So there's still an important need in the marketplace. This innovative delivery device enables us to meet a large portion of that need. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc. Derek, let's go with the next question. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Geoffrey, you may begin your question. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC Thanks very much and thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up on the question about erenumab, Bob, could you take us through your thinking about the partnering decision? Because you're in a strong net cash position. You've got robust cash flow. You've got plenty of space in your R&D given the sequential trend, and yet you partner one of your two late-stage products for what certainly looks like it's a fairly specialized prescriber base initially. So could you talk a little bit about that, and then also how you'll be collaborating with Novartis on the launch? Particularly, who will be setting price and how you're thinking about price? Thanks. Sorry for the complicated question. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. No, that's fine, Geoff. We'll take it in two parts. Why don't I take the first piece? Then we'll have Tony address some of the specifics in your question. We recognize and we're excited about the opportunity to have a first-in-class and a molecule that we think has a good chance to be best-in-class for a disease where there just aren't good therapies available today, so we're excited about that. But at the same time, Geoff, I think there is a specialty element of this that we don't have experience in. Novartis has been in the neurology neuroscience field for some 60 odd years now, and so they have a real established track record there. And as we interacted with them first with respect to the international markets, I think we came to realize there were opportunities to create a bigger opportunity by combining forces than by going it alone in the international markets. We've come to know and share and respect each other's capabilities over the time since that agreement went into place. And as we looked at the opportunity in the U.S. and our desire to make sure we resource this to win, including getting off to a strong start with the specialist prescribers, it was our view that our shareholders were going to be better served by our joining up with somebody that had a very established presence in this field. So that's our view, and I think all of our interactions since then make us feel confident that that was the right decision for the shareholders. But, Tony, why don't you add your thoughts? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Sure, we've been working with Novartis now from a global research perspective and a global marketing perspective for some time. So the teams have gotten to know each other quite well. My counterpart and I have been drawn into these discussions with these experts, as I said, and he and I are becoming even more increasingly excited about the opportunity to deliver a first-in-class product like this to patients in need. He and I both have experience in terms of launching products in the U.S. over the last five years or so, and we understand some of the barriers and some of the challenges. But we also understand the large unmet need over here. It's clear to us that a strong start in terms of having a clear group of physicians who realize the importance of treating patients properly is going to be important to place pressure on the entire payer system to ensure we can get access. They have a very good presence in the neuroscience market. The feedback we've had from third-party research has shown their team and their medical team are very well regarded, and this strong relationship in our mind will support the ability to launch fast, launch rapidly, and be highly effective in the initial uptake. So they're a good team to be with. We will work closely with them, and I think we can maximize our ability to bring value to patients. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. And, Geoff, as regard to your questions about operational details, obviously those are topics that we discuss with them in detail before we move forward. And we think between the two of us, we think we've got those details worked out. But again, we're excited to have this partnership in hand and we look forward to getting this molecule approved so we can get out and help patients with it. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC Great, good luck. Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital. Ian, you may begin your question. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you, just another question on Repatha. You made a comment that payers could potentially make some changes over the coming months. I was just hoping to clarify. Are those changes in prior authorization, or are they just payers being more diligent in making sure the right patients are getting access to the therapy? And as I think about ACC.8 (1:09:38), the guideline changes in some of the answers you provided, do you need those changes – do you need the new guidelines to state lower LDL goals, or what else, what other type of changes could we see which would benefit the PCSK9 class overall? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. So, Ian, it's Tony again. So clearly, everything here is driven from the interpretation and understanding about outcomes data, that fundamentally this product, Repatha, on top of maximally tolerated statins, which is the gold standard to date, is able to drive LDL down further and reduce even more dramatically the risk of heart attack and stroke. So the discussions with the payers are consistently around the utilization management criteria to make sure that the burden is less onerous for physicians, that they and patients are able to get access to products quicker and faster. White papers or position papers from professional cardiology organizations are really essential to start paving the way to ensure we move towards the guidelines down the road. But they factor, the good clinical data is what's important. Payers have said to us from the beginning that yes, they see the drug lowers LDL, but they need to understand what that means. The outcomes data now shows you what that means, and all our discussions have been, if we are to renegotiate a contract, it is based around the payers' willingness to amend and make more simple the utilization management criteria. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer, you may begin your question. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two pipeline questions, if I may. On romosozumab, the upcoming ARCH trial, what percentage of patients were enrolled in Latin America? And secondly on CGRP, I noticed you have a TREADMILL CV safety trial that wrapped up earlier in the year. Any update and/or feedback from that, and was that a study that FDA asked you to do? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Okay, so with respect to ARCH, the percentage of patients in Latin America, I don't remember an exact number, but it is substantially less that it was in the FRAME study, but it is still meaningful. So I think it's about 30% roughly, whereas it was higher than that in FRAME. But I think it's important to recognize that it wasn't the part of the world that the drug was being administered that was the problem. It was the fact that the fracture rates in a placebo-controlled population where physicians were very hesitant to put high-risk individuals into the trial because of the placebo arm, that the fracture rate was so low that we really didn't have any opportunity to demonstrate a further lowering of the fracture rate. And we don't expect that phenomenon in FRAME because the patients that were enrolled were by definition, by protocol, much higher risk. They had to have had prevalent fracture already. They have had much lower T-scores and so on, because in this case, patients are either getting romosozumab followed by alendronate, or alendronate from the get-go with no placebo control. So I wouldn't focus so much around the question of Latin America, although that was where we saw the problem with the very low event rates. And then the other piece to keep in mind is that we do have an event-driven analysis for non-vertebral fracture in ARCH which we didn't have in FRAME. And that also, as you know, addresses this event number powering problem that you can run into, which is essentially the wall we hit in FRAME. With respect to CGRP, I think it's a very good question. One of the things that I learned from talking with people at the meetings in Boston is that the real question in most neurologists' mind right now about the CGRP class remains long-term safety and tolerability. They're very impressed with the efficacy data. They're very impressed with the tolerability and safety that have been observed to date in relatively short exposures in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 study. And so I think there are a number of things that we have been doing specifically as a company, like we have over three years of long-term exposure in open-label extension studies. Other companies, to our knowledge, have not been doing this. We did the CV TREADMILL study on our own volition because we felt that, again, these were going to be kind of questions that would exist in the marketplace. We have a number of pre-clinical and clinical studies, for example, on the impact on blood pressure and so on that would have been done specifically in anticipation of the kind of questions that prescribers will have around the long-term safety of the product. Many of these data are not broadly appreciated because they haven't come out in peer-reviewed publications and they haven't been necessarily presented in plenary type presentations like the Phase 3 data were. But in aggregate, I think these are going to be important and potentially differentiating data for the product. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC That's very helpful, thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Carter, you may begin your question. Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Sean, I'll stick with the pipeline theme. On the BLINCYTO studies, you referenced the ALL B-cell (1:15:25). When do you think those data might be presented? Could those be registrational? And on CNP520, is there an interim built into that Alzheimer's study? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes, so the BLINCYTO studies are just enrolling now, so it's a little bit hard to project when we would be presenting data from them. That depends, of course, on a number of factors in terms of enrollment rate and when we might hit certain milestones with respect to interim analyses and so on. But the program is progressing on plan, and we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm in the marketplace in the clinical trial investigator space, I should say, for the program. And then with respect to the CNP520 program, there are some futility analyses built into the Alzheimer's study, which are designed to cut losses if we weren't seeing some kind of an effect. And I believe there may be also an early stopping efficacy interim late in the trial, though. I'd have to go back and look at the protocol to be sure about that. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Sean, not everybody might be familiar with CNP520. So you just might remind them (1:16:56) Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes, so you might remember that this was highlighted in The Wall Street Journal the other day. Novartis and Amgen I think had come convergently to the opinion that we have extremely high confidence in the target itself, in large part because of the genetic validation work that was done on this target at deCODE. And so the question is really a question of when to intervene. And what we're doing in this study is enriching for a population, who based on their APOE genotype and age are very highly predisposed to converting from a normal cognitive capability to a minimally impaired cognitive capability. So we're going earlier than anyone else has done to date. This actually may be what's required to demonstrate a disease modifying effect. So the molecule itself is a very high-quality small molecule BACE inhibitor that has been demonstrated to drop A-beta levels dramatically in CSF and all that good stuff. And the main issue strategically is to go in a little bit earlier in this population. And while this is a genetically defined population, about 60% of patients who actually develop Alzheimer's have one of these predisposing alleles. So it's not some tiny little population. It's genetically defined. Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoff, you may begin your question. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question, one for Tony or Sean. So in contrast to Repatha, you haven't had a lot of payer pushback on Prolia. So are there payer or pricing lessons to be learned when you think about the romo [romosozumab] launch in July and its combination with Prolia? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Let me take that one, Geoff. The major difference probably between the two is that the majority of Prolia sales are Part B, so it's a buy in bulk model, where Repatha is predominantly a Part D or a retail product we sell. I think it's all around the value proposition, and we go back again to the day we presented at the ACC just to reconfirm that the present net price of Repatha in the marketplace is well within the range of the value proposition or the value-based pricing in fact for this particular product. So I think the two things are different. There was a lot of speculation up front about how the PCSK9s could cost the market $150 billion or whatever it was, which resulted in some silly actions, I think, with all due respect. The drugs continue to show real good BAT value. We're happy to stand up and discuss it anywhere. And how the bank (1:19:54) would pay at the moment is how do you change the utilization management criteria, nothing else. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Raymond James. Chris, you may begin your question. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Hey, thanks. So just a broader question on the biologics market structure and maybe as it relates to your biosimilar business. So we were reading a white paper that I think you guys put out recently on the biosimilar market. I think you guys highlight a real problem. Even under a hypothetical scenario, I think your paper talked about how where a biosimilar is priced at, say, a 25% discount to the innovator, you still have a patient copay that's still higher than the innovative drug. I think in your paper it said almost 40% higher under Medicare Part D. So just curious, you guys seem as close as anyone to policy makers and directions to where this may go, and I know you devoted a great deal of time and energy towards your biosimilar business. I assume that there's an expectation here that some of these disincentives will go away. Can you maybe talk in broad terms how you think that might play out? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Tony, why don't you go ahead and take that? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Sure. One, I don't remember us putting out a white paper, so I just want to make sure that we're not being given authorship of something we didn't write because I'm unaware of Amgen putting out a white paper. We have said historically in the past that we believe that the biosimilar market will move much like a branded generic market; that the pricing in the beginning will be cautious; that the people who come to market and those who actually use biosimilars will be looking for a combination of quality, continuity of quality, continuity of supply, and the reputations of the organizations coming to market. We believe that at Amgen we have a lot of good reputation. We have a 38-year history of never shorting a patient, of having quality product consistently on the marketplace. As we've gone through the process of actually developing these biosimilars ourselves, we've realized how tough it is to actually bring these drugs to market or how to develop them. We've spent time with regulators around the world making sure they understand what good looks like, that the rules and regulations are aligned with what we are doing. There is some debate in the U.S. around linked J-codes between the brand versus the biosimilar. I think those are still being debated at the moment. But until then, it's an unlinked J-code, which means the reimbursement or copays are different. There's a lot happening in the marketplace, and how that could change, I can't speculate now. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc. Derek, as it's going on 6:30 on the East Coast, let's take two last questions. Operator Okay, absolutely. And your next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies. Eun, you may begin your question. Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC Thanks, a question for Sean. In your collaboration with Arrowhead on RNAi therapies targeting cardiovascular diseases, what's your view on potential safety issues that may be related to RNAi-based therapies? And when do you expect to move into clinic? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes, I think that the siRNA technologies right now look good enough that in the case where the only way one can drug a target appears to be siRNA-based inhibition, it's a reasonable thing to pursue. And so that's what we're doing, for example, for LPa where we don't feel there's any other way to drug the target. It's not a derisked platform at this point, and there obviously are concerns. And I think that regulators are going to be very cautious in approving products early on that are based on this kind of novel platform, unless of course it's in a setting where there's very high unmet need and no other kind of options. So we are exploring siRNA largely in settings in which the drug can't be – the target can't be interdicted in other ways, and also where we feel that the therapy would be unique in its ability to address that target. So LPa represents an example like that. We have other targets that we feel are potentially that way. And so at this point, we're moving that ahead. The program is really still in a preclinical stage, but it is moving very rapidly. The collaboration has been great. But I can't really give specific timelines of when it would be in the clinic at this point. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc. Let's take one last question, and then Bob will make a few closing comments. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Salim Syed. Salim, you may begin your question. Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Great. Thanks, guys, for squeezing me in, just a question on romo maybe for Sean or for Tony. The non-vertebral data, guys, how are you thinking about that in terms of uptake? And then also will we be getting that non-vertebral data in the press release, either in a qualitative form or quantitative form, when we get the top line? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes. So what I would say is that having evidence of non-vertebral fracture impact is important for cytotherapeutics (1:25:56). Of course, the most important endpoint for physicians, payers, and patients is clinical fracture, which is the symptomatic vertebral fractures which can be very profoundly impactful to patients' quality of life, as well as the long-bone fractures or non-vertebral fractures. And there, we've seen good results, and that's one of the co-primary endpoints for ARCH as well. And I think that it is something that is an important variable. In the end, things like hip fracture are the real dreaded complications of osteoporosis. So having a sense from the aggregate data for a molecule that there can be protection in sites like the hip is important, and that's why we're anticipating ARCH keenly, as it's coming very soon. I can't comment on what we exactly we'll decide to disclose in a press release. We are always focused on very complex embargo requirements by both the society clinical presentation venues as well as the journals that we're trying to publish in, and this can be quite an elaborate dance to figure out what we can put into our press releases in that setting. Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Got it, thanks so much. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. All right, thank you all for your questions and for your time. We appreciate it. Maybe just a quick couple of quick thoughts from me and then we'll let you back to work. First, as you heard in our discussion, we're pleased with the volume growth, particularly from our newer products in the quarter. Clearly, there was some noise in the first quarter around Enbrel and the trends. But as you heard us say, we think the long-term trends for Enbrel are on track despite that noise in the marketplace in the first quarter. And again, lastly, we think we've positioned the company well. And as a group here, we're excited about the future given the long-term growth opportunities that we see for Amgen. So thanks for your interest. We'll look forward to talking to you on the second quarter call. Operator This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator And your first question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence, begin your question. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi, thanks for taking the question, maybe just a two-part on Repatha. First, Tony, can you comment if the payers appreciate the details of the four-year data that Sean walked through? And then it looks like net price might have taken a step down in the U.S. in the first quarter. I'm just wondering if you can confirm that and any additional commentary that you can provide. Thank you. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Terence, sure. All our discussions with the payers have been really starting with the discussion on the Repatha outcomes data, and I don't think we've had any pushback at all in terms of people really understanding the robust value. We will continue to work with them. Obviously, each one of them has agreed to go back and relook at the utilization management criteria as we speak. There does appear to be a slight adjustment in the net price. One was due to a small accounting adjustment. And two, of course, we book our patient copay program to the net price, and the first quarter is normally a lot higher than second, third, or fourth. So we see that normalizing as we go forward. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Can we go to the next question? Operator And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew, you may begin your question. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great, thanks for taking the question. Tony, thanks for the detail on Enbrel. I'm sure, as you appreciate, there's a lot of questions that people have on that. If I can just ask two points there, you cited a market slowdown which you think will improve throughout the rest of the year. Could you just talk about your confidence around that? And beyond some of the weekly data points, are there other reasons to believe that broadly the market is not slowing? And then second, it seems to me that the impact on price in the first quarter is higher than you've seen in quarters past, even when thinking about copay assistance and some of the other factors. Is there anything else going on there, and what's your confidence about price leveling out for the year? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Thanks, Matt. So as you know, with Enbrel as a retail product, about 97% of the volume is reported on a script basis, so we can track it quite tightly. For the quarter, it was definitely down, both rheumatology and dermatology. When I look at it sequentially, January, February, March, and then as I see it going into April, each one of those months has shown an incremental growth both in terms of DOT as well as prescriptions and in terms of growth. So January was down a lot. February was better than January. March was better than February, and April is starting to look much better than March as well. From a net price, we don't see a dramatic change in the net price. Some the new contracts are coming into place, but our outlook on net price for 2017 hasn't changed at all. And when I look at abandonment rates, abandonment rates in the first quarter are pretty similar for Enbrel to what they were in the fourth quarter or the third quarter last year. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. And, Matthew, maybe just big picture here, when we look at the flow of patients into the information space, particularly rheumatology and dermatology, we see no reason in the marketplace that the trend of an increasing number of patients into this therapy would have abruptly changed between the fourth and the first quarter. So we think that we'll continue to see growth in the underlying demand for these kind of products. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ying, you may begin your question. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on Repatha. How much have you heard from the physicians in terms of feedback that they have to wait for a treatment guideline change by, let's say, ACC or AHA before they start prescribing more Repatha? And if that's the case, when do you think those professional organizations will change the guideline? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. I think it's probably a subtle question that you're asking there, Ying, so why don't we just take a moment and really step through it. Tony, why don't you go ahead and take the first go. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. So all our discussions with cardiologists have been around their frustration of the administrative burden that has been placed upon them to get a prescription for appropriate patients. A lot of them are having to hire full-time nurses to spend the entire day chasing down required patient data, to chase down interactions between the patient or between the physician and the respective payer or the PBM. The guidelines themselves clearly in everyone's mind would help move the decision-making and the utilization criteria a bit quicker. But our major conversation with physicians is not really around the guidelines; it's more around the inconvenience. From a guideline perspective, clearly both the AHA and the ACC are busy looking at the outcomes data. They've told us they're busy identifying position papers they wish to put forward. The NLA, the National Lipid Association, was there. The Association of Preventive Cardiology (sic) [American Society of Preventive Cardiology] (54:25), run by Dr. Seth Baum, is in the process of looking at a revised set of guidelines, including a proposed set of utilization management criteria, which they're proposing the PBMs and the payers should be using. In terms of guidelines themselves, both the AHA and the ACC have said it will take some time before they actually get to a final guideline change. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. I think the important information here is that the data demonstrated that lower is better, or as Sean said and as we increasingly hear from experts in the field, lowest is best. And I think people recognize that the current guidelines are out of sync with that. So the data make the point clear, and we expect to see white papers and then ultimately changes in the guidelines. But for right now, the data are an important piece of getting people to understand how to manage this disease for patients. Let's go to the next question. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen. Eric, you may begin your question. Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC Thanks. Just as a follow-on to Ying's question, it sounds like the major bottleneck is this hassle factor, Tony, that physicians are being put through, and I guess I'm just wondering what kind of leverage Amgen has to reduce that factor. Can't payers just stay entrenched and say our policies are that we'll cover it, but we're going to make you go through X, Y, and Z hoops and maintain the hassle factor and I guess the evidence of better medicine? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. So, Eric, I don't think I've spoken to a single cardiologist or general practitioner who hasn't commented on how onerous the process is to gain access to these products. I think without a doubt, the third-party organizations, the professional organizations such as the ACC, the AHA, as well as patient organizations such as the FH Foundation are the ones who are running the research work at the moment, including Duke, as I said. We actually looked at those patients who received a PCSK9 and those who didn't, and actually show there's no clinical difference in the patients themselves. This type of burden I think is going to start putting the pressure on the payers. Talking to the payers, they themselves are agreeing with us that the clinical data is important, and they need to expand access to appropriate patients. So we will continue to drive that interaction with them. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory, you may begin your question. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great, thanks for taking the question. Good afternoon. I have a pretty commercial question on erenumab. I wonder if you can comment on early interactions you're having with payers on that front or maybe just general market research for the product. I guess specifically, I'm wondering how much of an impediment you expect access to be in the early days of that pending launch and how much your research may have factored into the strategic decision to further engage with Novartis. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. So let me start, Cory, by just telling you about an interaction I had with my counterpart at Novartis yesterday. He and I have both been in recent contact with neurologists who specialize in treating patients with chronic migraine. And the two of us are quite elated at the level of excitement we're seeing amongst these physicians about having for the first time in decades a treatment opportunity to really help people who have this debilitating disease. It truly is one of those symptomatic diseases where if you've got a migraine, you really know about it, and it impacts how you run your life. Can you run your life or can you be a good caregiver? We are starting our discussions with the payers right now. We are helping them see the data from a clinical perspective. Obviously, the real negotiation can only start once we have the label, and we look forward to having that in the next couple months or so. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Josh, you may begin your question. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thanks for taking the question. If you can, help us understand the market segmentation in asthma, really the issue with AMG 157 again versus some of the other novel biologics targeting the IL4 side pathways (58:46). Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Okay. The question was a little bit hard to hear, Josh, but I think, Sean, why don't you take the first crack at it? Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes, what I would say is that it's still early days for a lot of the therapies that are still in development. But as you look across the biologics landscape in asthma, there's a few things that are clear. One is that in aggregate, asthma is an enormous opportunity from the perspective of the unmet need and the number of patients who are, for example, having to take courses of oral corticosteroids throughout the course of the year to manage their disease, which is very problematic for them. And I think what you're seeing is that many of the mechanisms that are either out there now in biologics or being developed currently are segmented to populations that, for example, have high eosinophilic counts, atopic phenotype, et cetera. And in the case of TSLP, what we like about TSLP is it is a very upstream kind of a mediator of this inflammation. And our expectation is that we could have a very broad impact on patients with activity across the spectrum of patient phenotypes within the asthma disease spectrum, which would make it a very attractive therapeutic option. Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny, you may begin your question. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Good evening and thank you for taking my question. I guess the Supreme Court have been looking at the biosimilar law today. In the case they side with you and find that shall means will, can you give us a feel for what will happen with the biosimilars that have already launched for Neulasta? Will they have to come back into the full patent dance? Essentially, if you win this case, what does it mean in terms of delay of biosimilar Neulasta approvals or launches? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. I think there are a couple things in your question there, Ronny. Let me tease apart the two pieces of it. First, as you know, the Supreme Court reviewed this today, and so we'll know within a matter of weeks. Obviously, we think the 180-day needs to be enforced as it was written in the law. But with respect – I think you must have been referring to the short-acting competitors to NEUPOGEN. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC No, I was talking about the patent dance and impact of Neulasta biosimilar launches. Essentially, if you win that, will the biosimilar Neulasta be delayed? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. I guess I'm not sure what you mean by delayed. I think again, the big picture here, Ronny, is that we've known for some time that we'll face biosimilar competition. We're expecting that that will happen for Neulasta, and we're ready for that. You've seen the actions that we've been taking over the past couple years to be ready for that. And we're ready to embrace the competition, and we've positioned the company from an operating expense standpoint with the knowledge that that competition is coming, and we're launching medicines and entering markets that we think will help us grow beyond that. So the 180-day is obviously post-FDA approval, so we're watching different competitive products make their way through the regulatory pathway. David W. Meline - Amgen, Inc. If I could then, in terms of the guidance we've offered, there are none that have been approved yet to compete with Neulasta. There's one that's lined up I think in the third quarter here. So if it were approved and the 180-day stands, then that would imply, as we've indicated, that we could face competition as soon as late this year, and that's how our guidance is built right now. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Thank you. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Yes. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Alethia, you may begin your question. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just again on Neulasta, I know Onpro is picking up momentum. But I'm just trying to figure out if you think – how do you think this helps defend you against biosimilar share? Is it as simple as that the market is remodeling itself, and so it delays and prolongs some of the competition that you may see, or is there some other dynamic we should be aware of? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Alethia, it's Tony. So let me go back to a comment I made on the last quarter earnings. Let's use MD Anderson as an example of probably one of the premier large oncology teaching centers in the country. It took MD Anderson almost – just over 12 months to go through their P&T committee to get an agreement within the institution to start shifting patients to Onpro. And the rationale was they were really having a good look at the clinical value, the treatment protocols, the discharge protocols, and they finally agreed that this product was certainly worthwhile having. We spent a number of weeks training their 600 oncology nurses so they were able to really identify the right patient, administer the drug before patients went home, and they have therefore changed the clinical practice. The feedback we get from both the oncology nurses, the oncologists themselves, and patients in fact about the fact they no longer have to come back 24 hours later or a day after their chemotherapy when they're in the middle of chemo-induced nausea and vomiting is a huge advantage and allows them a better quality of life. So we really believe that the benefit this drug brings is not simply a device. It is really something that allows patients to continue to live their lives whilst being treated for cancer. It also has resulted in changes, definitive changes in discharge protocols, which we think will take some time to be reversed if there's no other alternative. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Yes, it's worth keeping in mind the big picture here, Alethia. There's some data in a peer review publication from this week recognizing that there are 100,000 hospitalizations a year in this country from patients who suffer from an infection while undergoing chemotherapy, and of course that's what NEUPOGEN and Neulasta are designed to address. And any product like Onpro that can help prevent some number of those infections is an important product. So there's still an important need in the marketplace. This innovative delivery device enables us to meet a large portion of that need. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc. Derek, let's go with the next question. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners. Geoffrey, you may begin your question. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC Thanks very much and thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up on the question about erenumab, Bob, could you take us through your thinking about the partnering decision? Because you're in a strong net cash position. You've got robust cash flow. You've got plenty of space in your R&D given the sequential trend, and yet you partner one of your two late-stage products for what certainly looks like it's a fairly specialized prescriber base initially. So could you talk a little bit about that, and then also how you'll be collaborating with Novartis on the launch? Particularly, who will be setting price and how you're thinking about price? Thanks. Sorry for the complicated question. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. No, that's fine, Geoff. We'll take it in two parts. Why don't I take the first piece? Then we'll have Tony address some of the specifics in your question. We recognize and we're excited about the opportunity to have a first-in-class and a molecule that we think has a good chance to be best-in-class for a disease where there just aren't good therapies available today, so we're excited about that. But at the same time, Geoff, I think there is a specialty element of this that we don't have experience in. Novartis has been in the neurology neuroscience field for some 60 odd years now, and so they have a real established track record there. And as we interacted with them first with respect to the international markets, I think we came to realize there were opportunities to create a bigger opportunity by combining forces than by going it alone in the international markets. We've come to know and share and respect each other's capabilities over the time since that agreement went into place. And as we looked at the opportunity in the U.S. and our desire to make sure we resource this to win, including getting off to a strong start with the specialist prescribers, it was our view that our shareholders were going to be better served by our joining up with somebody that had a very established presence in this field. So that's our view, and I think all of our interactions since then make us feel confident that that was the right decision for the shareholders. But, Tony, why don't you add your thoughts? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Sure, we've been working with Novartis now from a global research perspective and a global marketing perspective for some time. So the teams have gotten to know each other quite well. My counterpart and I have been drawn into these discussions with these experts, as I said, and he and I are becoming even more increasingly excited about the opportunity to deliver a first-in-class product like this to patients in need. He and I both have experience in terms of launching products in the U.S. over the last five years or so, and we understand some of the barriers and some of the challenges. But we also understand the large unmet need over here. It's clear to us that a strong start in terms of having a clear group of physicians who realize the importance of treating patients properly is going to be important to place pressure on the entire payer system to ensure we can get access. They have a very good presence in the neuroscience market. The feedback we've had from third-party research has shown their team and their medical team are very well regarded, and this strong relationship in our mind will support the ability to launch fast, launch rapidly, and be highly effective in the initial uptake. So they're a good team to be with. We will work closely with them, and I think we can maximize our ability to bring value to patients. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. And, Geoff, as regard to your questions about operational details, obviously those are topics that we discuss with them in detail before we move forward. And we think between the two of us, we think we've got those details worked out. But again, we're excited to have this partnership in hand and we look forward to getting this molecule approved so we can get out and help patients with it. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC Great, good luck. Thanks. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital. Ian, you may begin your question. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you, just another question on Repatha. You made a comment that payers could potentially make some changes over the coming months. I was just hoping to clarify. Are those changes in prior authorization, or are they just payers being more diligent in making sure the right patients are getting access to the therapy? And as I think about ACC.8 (1:09:38), the guideline changes in some of the answers you provided, do you need those changes – do you need the new guidelines to state lower LDL goals, or what else, what other type of changes could we see which would benefit the PCSK9 class overall? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. So, Ian, it's Tony again. So clearly, everything here is driven from the interpretation and understanding about outcomes data, that fundamentally this product, Repatha, on top of maximally tolerated statins, which is the gold standard to date, is able to drive LDL down further and reduce even more dramatically the risk of heart attack and stroke. So the discussions with the payers are consistently around the utilization management criteria to make sure that the burden is less onerous for physicians, that they and patients are able to get access to products quicker and faster. White papers or position papers from professional cardiology organizations are really essential to start paving the way to ensure we move towards the guidelines down the road. But they factor, the good clinical data is what's important. Payers have said to us from the beginning that yes, they see the drug lowers LDL, but they need to understand what that means. The outcomes data now shows you what that means, and all our discussions have been, if we are to renegotiate a contract, it is based around the payers' willingness to amend and make more simple the utilization management criteria. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer, you may begin your question. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two pipeline questions, if I may. On romosozumab, the upcoming ARCH trial, what percentage of patients were enrolled in Latin America? And secondly on CGRP, I noticed you have a TREADMILL CV safety trial that wrapped up earlier in the year. Any update and/or feedback from that, and was that a study that FDA asked you to do? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Okay, so with respect to ARCH, the percentage of patients in Latin America, I don't remember an exact number, but it is substantially less that it was in the FRAME study, but it is still meaningful. So I think it's about 30% roughly, whereas it was higher than that in FRAME. But I think it's important to recognize that it wasn't the part of the world that the drug was being administered that was the problem. It was the fact that the fracture rates in a placebo-controlled population where physicians were very hesitant to put high-risk individuals into the trial because of the placebo arm, that the fracture rate was so low that we really didn't have any opportunity to demonstrate a further lowering of the fracture rate. And we don't expect that phenomenon in FRAME because the patients that were enrolled were by definition, by protocol, much higher risk. They had to have had prevalent fracture already. They have had much lower T-scores and so on, because in this case, patients are either getting romosozumab followed by alendronate, or alendronate from the get-go with no placebo control. So I wouldn't focus so much around the question of Latin America, although that was where we saw the problem with the very low event rates. And then the other piece to keep in mind is that we do have an event-driven analysis for non-vertebral fracture in ARCH which we didn't have in FRAME. And that also, as you know, addresses this event number powering problem that you can run into, which is essentially the wall we hit in FRAME. With respect to CGRP, I think it's a very good question. One of the things that I learned from talking with people at the meetings in Boston is that the real question in most neurologists' mind right now about the CGRP class remains long-term safety and tolerability. They're very impressed with the efficacy data. They're very impressed with the tolerability and safety that have been observed to date in relatively short exposures in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 study. And so I think there are a number of things that we have been doing specifically as a company, like we have over three years of long-term exposure in open-label extension studies. Other companies, to our knowledge, have not been doing this. We did the CV TREADMILL study on our own volition because we felt that, again, these were going to be kind of questions that would exist in the marketplace. We have a number of pre-clinical and clinical studies, for example, on the impact on blood pressure and so on that would have been done specifically in anticipation of the kind of questions that prescribers will have around the long-term safety of the product. Many of these data are not broadly appreciated because they haven't come out in peer-reviewed publications and they haven't been necessarily presented in plenary type presentations like the Phase 3 data were. But in aggregate, I think these are going to be important and potentially differentiating data for the product. Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC That's very helpful, thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Carter, you may begin your question. Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Sean, I'll stick with the pipeline theme. On the BLINCYTO studies, you referenced the ALL B-cell (1:15:25). When do you think those data might be presented? Could those be registrational? And on CNP520, is there an interim built into that Alzheimer's study? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes, so the BLINCYTO studies are just enrolling now, so it's a little bit hard to project when we would be presenting data from them. That depends, of course, on a number of factors in terms of enrollment rate and when we might hit certain milestones with respect to interim analyses and so on. But the program is progressing on plan, and we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm in the marketplace in the clinical trial investigator space, I should say, for the program. And then with respect to the CNP520 program, there are some futility analyses built into the Alzheimer's study, which are designed to cut losses if we weren't seeing some kind of an effect. And I believe there may be also an early stopping efficacy interim late in the trial, though. I'd have to go back and look at the protocol to be sure about that. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Sean, not everybody might be familiar with CNP520. So you just might remind them (1:16:56) Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes, so you might remember that this was highlighted in The Wall Street Journal the other day. Novartis and Amgen I think had come convergently to the opinion that we have extremely high confidence in the target itself, in large part because of the genetic validation work that was done on this target at deCODE. And so the question is really a question of when to intervene. And what we're doing in this study is enriching for a population, who based on their APOE genotype and age are very highly predisposed to converting from a normal cognitive capability to a minimally impaired cognitive capability. So we're going earlier than anyone else has done to date. This actually may be what's required to demonstrate a disease modifying effect. So the molecule itself is a very high-quality small molecule BACE inhibitor that has been demonstrated to drop A-beta levels dramatically in CSF and all that good stuff. And the main issue strategically is to go in a little bit earlier in this population. And while this is a genetically defined population, about 60% of patients who actually develop Alzheimer's have one of these predisposing alleles. So it's not some tiny little population. It's genetically defined. Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Geoff, you may begin your question. Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question, one for Tony or Sean. So in contrast to Repatha, you haven't had a lot of payer pushback on Prolia. So are there payer or pricing lessons to be learned when you think about the romo [romosozumab] launch in July and its combination with Prolia? Thanks. Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Let me take that one, Geoff. The major difference probably between the two is that the majority of Prolia sales are Part B, so it's a buy in bulk model, where Repatha is predominantly a Part D or a retail product we sell. I think it's all around the value proposition, and we go back again to the day we presented at the ACC just to reconfirm that the present net price of Repatha in the marketplace is well within the range of the value proposition or the value-based pricing in fact for this particular product. So I think the two things are different. There was a lot of speculation up front about how the PCSK9s could cost the market $150 billion or whatever it was, which resulted in some silly actions, I think, with all due respect. The drugs continue to show real good BAT value. We're happy to stand up and discuss it anywhere. And how the bank (1:19:54) would pay at the moment is how do you change the utilization management criteria, nothing else. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Raymond James. Chris, you may begin your question. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Hey, thanks. So just a broader question on the biologics market structure and maybe as it relates to your biosimilar business. So we were reading a white paper that I think you guys put out recently on the biosimilar market. I think you guys highlight a real problem. Even under a hypothetical scenario, I think your paper talked about how where a biosimilar is priced at, say, a 25% discount to the innovator, you still have a patient copay that's still higher than the innovative drug. I think in your paper it said almost 40% higher under Medicare Part D. So just curious, you guys seem as close as anyone to policy makers and directions to where this may go, and I know you devoted a great deal of time and energy towards your biosimilar business. I assume that there's an expectation here that some of these disincentives will go away. Can you maybe talk in broad terms how you think that might play out? Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. Tony, why don't you go ahead and take that? Anthony C. Hooper - Amgen, Inc. Sure. One, I don't remember us putting out a white paper, so I just want to make sure that we're not being given authorship of something we didn't write because I'm unaware of Amgen putting out a white paper. We have said historically in the past that we believe that the biosimilar market will move much like a branded generic market; that the pricing in the beginning will be cautious; that the people who come to market and those who actually use biosimilars will be looking for a combination of quality, continuity of quality, continuity of supply, and the reputations of the organizations coming to market. We believe that at Amgen we have a lot of good reputation. We have a 38-year history of never shorting a patient, of having quality product consistently on the marketplace. As we've gone through the process of actually developing these biosimilars ourselves, we've realized how tough it is to actually bring these drugs to market or how to develop them. We've spent time with regulators around the world making sure they understand what good looks like, that the rules and regulations are aligned with what we are doing. There is some debate in the U.S. around linked J-codes between the brand versus the biosimilar. I think those are still being debated at the moment. But until then, it's an unlinked J-code, which means the reimbursement or copays are different. There's a lot happening in the marketplace, and how that could change, I can't speculate now. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc. Derek, as it's going on 6:30 on the East Coast, let's take two last questions. Operator Okay, absolutely. And your next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies. Eun, you may begin your question. Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC Thanks, a question for Sean. In your collaboration with Arrowhead on RNAi therapies targeting cardiovascular diseases, what's your view on potential safety issues that may be related to RNAi-based therapies? And when do you expect to move into clinic? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes, I think that the siRNA technologies right now look good enough that in the case where the only way one can drug a target appears to be siRNA-based inhibition, it's a reasonable thing to pursue. And so that's what we're doing, for example, for LPa where we don't feel there's any other way to drug the target. It's not a derisked platform at this point, and there obviously are concerns. And I think that regulators are going to be very cautious in approving products early on that are based on this kind of novel platform, unless of course it's in a setting where there's very high unmet need and no other kind of options. So we are exploring siRNA largely in settings in which the drug can't be – the target can't be interdicted in other ways, and also where we feel that the therapy would be unique in its ability to address that target. So LPa represents an example like that. We have other targets that we feel are potentially that way. And so at this point, we're moving that ahead. The program is really still in a preclinical stage, but it is moving very rapidly. The collaboration has been great. But I can't really give specific timelines of when it would be in the clinic at this point. Arvind K. Sood - Amgen, Inc. Let's take one last question, and then Bob will make a few closing comments. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Salim Syed. Salim, you may begin your question. Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Great. Thanks, guys, for squeezing me in, just a question on romo maybe for Sean or for Tony. The non-vertebral data, guys, how are you thinking about that in terms of uptake? And then also will we be getting that non-vertebral data in the press release, either in a qualitative form or quantitative form, when we get the top line? Thank you. Sean E. Harper - Amgen, Inc. Yes. So what I would say is that having evidence of non-vertebral fracture impact is important for cytotherapeutics (1:25:56). Of course, the most important endpoint for physicians, payers, and patients is clinical fracture, which is the symptomatic vertebral fractures which can be very profoundly impactful to patients' quality of life, as well as the long-bone fractures or non-vertebral fractures. And there, we've seen good results, and that's one of the co-primary endpoints for ARCH as well. And I think that it is something that is an important variable. In the end, things like hip fracture are the real dreaded complications of osteoporosis. So having a sense from the aggregate data for a molecule that there can be protection in sites like the hip is important, and that's why we're anticipating ARCH keenly, as it's coming very soon. I can't comment on what we exactly we'll decide to disclose in a press release. We are always focused on very complex embargo requirements by both the society clinical presentation venues as well as the journals that we're trying to publish in, and this can be quite an elaborate dance to figure out what we can put into our press releases in that setting. Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Got it, thanks so much. Robert A. Bradway - Amgen, Inc. All right, thank you all for your questions and for your time. We appreciate it. Maybe just a quick couple of quick thoughts from me and then we'll let you back to work. First, as you heard in our discussion, we're pleased with the volume growth, particularly from our newer products in the quarter. Clearly, there was some noise in the first quarter around Enbrel and the trends. But as you heard us say, we think the long-term trends for Enbrel are on track despite that noise in the marketplace in the first quarter. And again, lastly, we think we've positioned the company well. And as a group here, we're excited about the future given the long-term growth opportunities that we see for Amgen. So thanks for your interest. We'll look forward to talking to you on the second quarter call. Operator This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc. Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 27, 2017, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes among other things that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to draw attention to a new accounting rule that we implemented in Q1. The new rule requires excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation to be presented as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows. We retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to re-classify excess tax benefits from financing activities to operating activities. And as a result, you will see an increase in our free cash flow measures for prior periods. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2017, the excess tax benefit or deficiency for stock-based compensation is recognized as a component of tax expense rather than equity. This change resulted in a decrease to our tax expense for the quarter and a corresponding increase to our net income and earnings per share. Specific changes are presented in the footnotes to the consolidated statement of cash flows and related metrics provided in our press release. Further disclosure of the impact of the adoption of this accounting change can be found in our Form 10-Q. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question Question-and-Answer Session Operator At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. . Thank you. Our first question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Got it. I saw on the front page of the release you're really focused on India. Can you give us a progress update on how you're doing? Any thoughts on how far you're willing to take the investment levels there? And what are your thoughts on maybe when international margins can start to make progress? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure, Justin. Thank you. Yes, I think Jeff's comments were pretty dead on. The launch of Prime last year was a big turning point. We've increased Prime selection by 75% since launching that nine months ago in India, also increased the fulfillment capacity for sellers by 26% this year. On the content side, we've announced A-Team in the original TV series and we're customizing the content, so it's a really vast selection of local and global movies and TV shows that are available to the Indian public. You'll also notice that the Fire TV Stick was – a new version of it was launched in India with some important features there such as the ability to search in Hindi and in English, free data usage for three months and also data monitoring, which is important there. So again, we continue to be encouraged by both the response from customers and sellers. As far as level of investment is concerned, it is certainly one of our important investment areas. We see a lot of potential for the country and our business there. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Any thoughts on how much it is impacting your international profitability? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. I can't quantify it, or break it out specifically, but I will say it's a large factor as well as a couple other things in the international segment. So, keep in mind that we launched Prime Video in the fourth quarter, and now we have that in over 200 countries and territories. We're spreading a lot of the Prime benefits that we see in North America to other countries. We just opened up Amazon Fresh in Tokyo last weekend, but also Prime Now. You saw other things like our business B2B business just opened up in the UK. We have Amazon Devices. So there's a lot of moving parts here. The other big influence is the same trends are happening in international with respect to FBA growth and the fact that our Amazon fulfill network, or the units we shipped, are growing at a much faster clip than our paid unit growth. Last year we said that was a 40% – nearly 40% growth worldwide. So we're making the investments in warehouses, fulfillment capacity and delivery capacity to handle that. So there's a lot going on in international. We are very encouraged with the growth of the Prime program, and we're hopeful for the Prime Video that we launched in the fall. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Two questions. The North American operating margins seem to come down like 70 bps year-over-year, and I know it's not big books view of the margins, I get that. But it's sort of a change. You've had margins be flat or up year-over-year for quite some time, and then they dipped down. Just could you explain that? And then secondly on these – on the Echo devices, the Echo family, Alexa devices that are coming out, could you comment at all about what kind of impact you're seeing in terms of increased wallet or per share within households? Are you seeing it have an impact in terms of Amazon customers more likely to spend more once they have these devices in particular categories like groceries or household products, pantry products that they're more likely to spend because they have these devices in their houses, in their kitchens, in their living rooms? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure, Mark. Let me start with the Echo question first. So, yeah, we're very encouraged by the customer response to the Echo products. Not only the Echo products but the ability to use tablets, our tablets now as Echo devices, since we've spread the Alexa technology to many of those devices. And we're also happy with the success we've had with developers. There's now over 12,000 Alexa skills. So we think that's all foundational. The monetization, as you might call it, is a theme of your questions. That's not our primary issue right now. It's about building great products and delighting customers. We think as engagement – as we pick up engagement with the devices, it helps the engagement with Amazon as a whole. So whether someone is ordering off their Alexa device or whether they're going to their phone, or going to their computer, it all has the same effect for us. So, very pleased with the initial progress. We see a lot of momentum there and we continue to invest. And that's one of the answers to your second question on North America operating margin. So if I step back, let me just talk generally about investments. So right now, we're just seeing a lot of great opportunities before us. And we're continuing to ramp up the investments in pursuit of those opportunities. And the big picture is, again, as we've said customers – the things customers love can grow to be large, we'll have strong financial returns and they're durable and can last for decades. So in that category, and some of the things that we're investing the most in are as you say the Echo and Alexa devices. We're doubling down on that investment, video content and marketing, not only in the U.S. but globally with the launch of our Prime Video in the fall. So, we're building global scale in that business in both content and marketing. As I said earlier, we're expanding Prime benefits in the U.S. and also globally. Things like Prime Music, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, all expanding globally. And we have launched Prime in India, China and Mexico. I know I'm drifting a bit from North America, but it's all part of the same theme. We also have this trend going on in our fulfillment networks where strong FBA growth and high growth in Amazon fulfilled unit is resulting in a large increase in fulfillment capacity. We're also investing in new technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning. You're starting to see some of that show up in things like Amazon Go, our beta store that we have developed in Seattle, drones. We use those technologies a lot in our internal businesses and we're also developing services for AWS customers. So – and that's of course another area is AWS continues to grow and add services and features and doing so at an accelerating rate. So there's a long list, and I can keep going. But I think the general theme is there's a lot of investment in front of us that we're optimistic about, and we continue to ramp those investments. In North America, that manifests itself mostly in the device area, the content area and also the expansion of the fulfillment networks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Amazon always had a pretty big focus on efficiencies. I'd be curious if you could talk about examples or areas where you have been able to iron out inefficiencies in the fulfillment process. And any still existing examples where you see low hanging fruit to really improve fulfillment efficiency? And then back to the point on investment. You didn't mention brick and mortar at all. There's been a lot of mention in the press about Amazon brick and mortar. I guess it would be curious to hear how you think about the importance of an Amazon brick and mortar presence and how that fits into the long-term strategy? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure thing. So, particularly as it pertains to our fulfillment center networks, I think the biggest areas of efficiency right now are in our Amazon Robotics areas. That technology continues to improve, and we have – we're now multiple generations down. We just launched am Amazon Robotics fulfillment center in the Tokyo area recently, and I toured that last month, and it's just amazing to see the strides that Amazon Robotics has taken and the efficiency we're getting in our warehouse as a result. The other efficiencies that we're seeing are network efficiencies, especially as we add things like sort centers. It's a collaboration and the movement between warehouses and sort centers and then to the end customer. The ability to have control through our sort centers has allowed us over the last few years to extend our cutoff times from 3:00 p.m. in most cases till midnight. So, greater control of our processes. If we do it cost effectively can also have favorable benefits both for our warehouse flow and also for our customers and their ordering pattern. So, there's a lot of efficiencies that are going on day-to-day around here. One of the benefits of rapid growth is the ability to create leverage on purchases and a lot of the processes that we run. So, your second question was on stores. Yes, I think you're seeing the expansion of our bookstores. We have six bookstores right now, and we have announced another six. The Amazon Go is in beta in Seattle, and while that's not large and only one site, we're excited about the potential there and the use of the technologies of computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning. We think that has a lot of potential. Again, it's only one location that's still in beta. But along with the bookstores, we also have – you'll see us in pop-up stores and college pickup points. So, for us it's another way to reach the customer and test what resonates with them, and we're pleased with the results. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I think you mentioned the accelerating growth within AWS on new products and last year you added about 1,000. Can you just talk about maybe the plans for AWS and product growth going forward here in 2017 and the focus on innovation? Thanks Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Yes, we haven't updated that number, but suffice to say the innovation pace continues to accelerate. We are very proud of the launches in Q4. The Amazon Connect, which we think will provide customer service capability to customers, and Amazon Chime, which we also believe will resonate with customers. We've had a lot of adoption of our new services. We've had – customers migrated more than 23,000 data basis using the AWS Database Migration Service since that launched last year. And just generally we continue to expand geographically. We have announced additional availability zones and regions worldwide. So, again, signed a number of big customers. I guess I would point out in the quarter, Liberty Mutual, Snap and Live Nation all starting relationships with us or expanding their current relationship. We're now over a $14 billion run rate. We're happy with the business and the team, and again, for us innovation is going to be key as we move forward. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Brian, I had a couple questions about your growing advertising business. We see more and more of it appearing on the site. And I was interested to hear a little bit more about how you expect that business to roll out internationally. I think it's largely U.S. based today, but be curious to hear about that. And then second, I think it's fairly obvious why someone selling within the Amazon ecosystem would be interested in promoting on the platform, but maybe tell us a little bit about maybe over the long-term there are opportunities for sort of non-endemic advertisers within your platform. Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Yeah, it's pretty early in the days with advertising, but we're very pleased with the team we have and the results. Our goal is to be helpful to consumers and enhance their shopping or their viewing experience with targeted recommendations, and we think a lot of the information we have and preferences of customers and recommendations help us do that for customers. We have a sponsored product, it's off to a great start, and it's a very effective way for advertisers to reach those especially interested customers. While you're on the topic of advertising, I thought I'd point out that in other revenue, advertising is in other revenue, as is co-branded credit card agreements and also some other advertising services. That decelerated from 99% in Q4 to 58% in Q1. But the fluctuation and the volatility was essentially in the co-branded credit card agreements and the other services, which can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on contract terms. And that's what happened. Advertising remained strong and was consistent growth with Q4. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thank you. So you periodically disclosed usage growth for AWS. But it has been some time since we saw one. So we're wondering if you can update us in terms of where you are now. If not, I mean, should we think about the growth in your cash deployment as an indicator of the ongoing growth? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Yes. Sorry, I don't have a usage number to share with you today. If it will help, I will tell you that, again, we're now over $14 billion run rate. You clearly see our – we break out very clearly our AWS segment revenue and operating income, and you'll also keep in mind that there's price decreases that are part of the business, and we're pretty public when we do those. And if you remember last call, I mentioned that we had seven price decreases that were timed for December 1. So, about a third of the impact of those was seen in Q4, and then again that's one element of the sequential operating margin. But in general, we're very happy with that team and the progress they're making. And we're deploying more capital as you can see to support the usage growth. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask you about CapEx. It looks like CapEx including leases more than doubled year-over-year. So I know you listed kind of a long list of the many investment opportunities here, but can you just point out anything else in particular that drove the pretty substantial increase there? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Yes, the CapEx, which is principally the fulfillment centers was – grew 51% year-over-year. As you'll remember, we added 26 warehouses last – fulfillment centers last year, 23 in the second half of the year. Some of that cost of start-up is before the start-up some comes in a quarter afterwards. So there was some carryover from that. But generally, the biggest trend here is that the differential between Amazon fulfilled network unit growth and paid unit growth. So that nearly 40% growth in Amazon fulfilled units last year, and the continuation of the strong growth higher than the paid unit growth that we see in 2017 is resulting in a lot of fulfillment center capacity. And the fulfillment centers I'll also say with the robotics technology tend to be more capital intensive than prior versions of warehouses, and then they generally have much better operating efficiencies and variable costs following their start-up. On the capital leases, that grew 45%. A good deal of that is tied to the AWS business. As I just mentioned, a lot of that is tied to usage growth. But a caution; CapEx can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, and if you look back to last year, the trailing 12 months was only 7% growth from the quarters through Q1 of last year. So certainly it was a bigger step-up in 2016 now carrying into 2017. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks. I know that we talked about over the last couple of quarters that part of the step-up in CapEx was to catch up from the under-investment in 2015. Just curious if you'd say – have you made a lot of progress in terms of catching up with some of the fulfillment needs that you saw necessary in the business at the beginning of last year? And then I know you just said that you're – it's still early days in terms of advertising, but there's a perception out there that over the last year or so that the company has sort of really begun to focus more on this business opportunity. Has something really changed at the business in the last year? And do you see advertising becoming a more meaningful part of the business over the near to midterm, I guess? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Let me start with advertising. So, yes, I think scale is helping. We've had great teams working on advertising for a while now. Our scale and number of customers, number of clicks, number of eyeballs, and new content – video content and other opportunities for advertising has really helped create some scale in that business. So we're very happy. I can't project it forward. But we're happy with the growth there. I think the sponsor products was a very inventive move for us, and I think that is having some really good impact on advertising growth. On your second point about fulfillment capacity; here's how I'd generally generalize it. In Q4 of 2015, we were pretty vocal or pretty transparent anyway that we ran out of space in Q4, especially due to some very strong demand for FBA space and services. Last year we changed some of our incentives and worked with FBA merchants to try and have better throughput through our FCs, particularly in Q4. That combined with the step-up in fulfillment centers that I mentioned, the 26 new ones, left us in a really good position. We had a very clean holiday, and we think it worked well for both customers, Amazon and also for sellers – for FBA sellers. So that leaves us now continuing to grow internationally as well because we continue to see strong FBA adoption, and it's a big part of our business, and it's a big part of our value with the additional Prime eligible ASNs that FBA provides. So, again, they're self-reinforcing, the FBA program and also our Prime program. The Prime program attracts more people to Amazon, and they buy more including FBA products and conversely more FBA products in our warehouses helps our in-stock of things that people want to buy, Prime eligible in-stock, and that helps reinforce the Prime program. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of how we should think about the increase in unearned revenue. Obviously, this quarter biggest increase that you have seen from at least from a dollar perspective. What does that say about the way customers are changing in the behavior in the AWS business? How should we think about the way that that might be impacting pricing, mix, near-term growth? Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc. Hi, Heath. This is Darin. Yeah, on a deferred revenue balances, as we've said in the past, the primary drivers of that increase are both the activity that we're seeing with our AWS customers and the purchase of Reserved Instances and prepaid credits for their account, as well as Prime member purchases. We're not breaking out the specific growth rates for Prime, but certainly it – we like what we see in terms of the growth, and it's been consistent with what we have seen over the last quarter or so. Certainly, the – part of that increase in deferred balances is related to Reserved Instances. As customers get more comfortable and begin to put more sustained workloads into the AWS services through buying RIs, they're able to get fairly significant discounts on their usage. And so we like that model. Customers certainly like that model. And collecting that through deferred revenue and then letting customers use that over time is very helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thank you. A question on the transportation and logistics initiatives. And in particular, if you could share any of the effects or learnings thus far with air cargo. In particular, what kind of performance or cost-efficiencies that you may be realizing or expect to realize from this effort. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure, Colin. As you point out, we're – we have expanded our own fleet. We now have 18 planes in service for Amazon, and we have announced rights to lease up to 40 planes. So it's gone very well. The ability to control shipments within our network has gone up, and we think the cost is very good. So on that front, it's better control, better capacity control, especially search capacity, and also good costs. So we have great relationships with third party carriers. We will continue to and we value all our partner relationships as we develop our own capability particularly in intra-network. We're putting it to good use, as I mentioned before, with the sortation center example. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Scott Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Hi. Thanks. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you are in terms of an investment in capabilities in India at this point and how you think about that market longer term. And then secondly, also if you could just comment on the limitations and your willingness to invest more throughout LatAm the way you have more recently in markets like China and India. And if I could, just finally, you've previously discussed satisfaction with the measurements of success for the video product in terms of consumer engagement, and the effects on Prime. I was just wondering if you could comment on whether these metrics are continuing to improve as spending continues to rise on video and consumer awareness is seemingly growing as well. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Let me start with your middle question. I think it was about Latin America growth. Let me step back and talk about international growth in general. So our approach varies by country, and if you look, historically we've taken multiple approaches. So in China, we bought an existing business Joyo.com and built off that base. In India, we started from scratch and have built a lot of things ourselves. And it's always going to depend on the country that the dynamics in that country both for retail, for online, and for foreign investment. But a real key factor in all of this generally is management bandwidth as well. So, we pick our spots carefully. You'll see – you heard in the quarter that we've announced the intention to buy Souq in the Middle East. Where does that fit into this strategy? Well, Souq's pioneered e-commerce in the Middle East, and they're creating great shipping experience for their customers and they're multiple countries, and they're doing a great job. So we see this as an example where we can learn from them, and also support their efforts with our Amazon technology and global resources. So we're in Mexico, but we're not in other parts of Latin America. We have a business in Brazil. But other countries we'll take on a case-by-case basis, again, bounded by what our management bandwidth can support and prioritization versus other things. You obviously heard my long list of investments. All of those are pretty much gated by the need for people and software engineers and strong teams to approach them. So international expansion gets played off in the same prioritization that other efforts do. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your questions. Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks. So is there just an accounting housekeeping a way to think about stock-based comp? You guys aren't providing that by segment anymore, but the rates of growth kind of differed by the businesses. And so is there just a way to think about, A, will that be in the queue? Or are you not disclosing it anymore? And is there a way to think about what I guess the patterns would be consistent with historical patterns by segment? Thanks. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc. Hi, Jason. This is Darin. Yes, we, a number of quarters back, started breaking out stock-based compensation by segment, and now we have collapsed that in our op income by segment. So it's definitely in there. We do provide some disclosure by P&L line item on a consolidated basis, that helps you identify that stock-based compensation expense in total and you'll see the trend and analysis and the metrics at the back of the press release. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I can take two away from the press release just to understand a little bit of the quarter-over-quarter cadence. On the retail subscription services, that saw a pretty big jump up in the growth rate year-on-year in Q1 versus Q4. I think that might be Prime memberships that come on to paid from trial. But just wanted to understand what maybe some of the driver was of that quarter-over-quarter in terms of the growth rate. And net shipping costs actually grew at the slowest rate by our count in a couple of years. It looks like you're starting to get some improvements there in terms of revenue over costs on the shipping line. Just wanted to know what that was in terms of what is driving that and can we expect that to possibly continue. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Let me start with the retail subscription services revenue. So there's multiple things in that category. The largest is Prime membership fees, but also other subscription services like audio books, eBooks, digital video, digital music, and other subscription services. So you're right, there was an acceleration, much like the comment I had on advertising and the other revenue category. The Prime membership growth rates for Q1 and Q4 last year are relatively consistent. So the volatility is in these other items. So I'm not quantifying the Prime membership or commenting on the growth rates, other than to say it's been very strong and Q4 strength has continued into Q1. Your comment on shipping costs, yeah, that is going to – it was lower unit volume as well, but generally, costs are going to be a combination of the tail – the headwinds are obviously going to be FBA growth and shipping more products ourselves and this expansion of our Prime program and the demand for products from our Prime customers. And the demand has been great. Again, there's over 50 million items that people can get delivered to their doorstep within two days or, in some cases, next day or same day. So it's going to be a big part of our cost structure but it's an investment we work hard to reduce as far as rates, and we're glad to spend it to support our Prime program. Operator Thank you. And our final question will come from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC Hi. Thanks. I had a follow-up and then a new question. The follow-up is, would love an update. You talked a lot about the fulfillment centers, but could you update us on where we are in terms of rolling out Prime Now facilities and sorting centers? You're just accounting a few – you feel that scenario, it's a really ramped up investment this year or what you got last year is sort of what you need? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. I'm sorry. You said Prime Now and what was the other thing? Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC And the sorting centers. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sort centers. Sort centers, right. Well, I don't have updated numbers for you, but the Prime Now is available in more than 45 cities across eight countries. The Same-Day is available in 30 cities in the U.S. So, that's a bit on the quantification of those. I can't tell you much more on sort centers. Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC But were you thinking about building out the capacity? It sounds like last year, you had that big surge in fulfillment centers. There isn't a similar surge about to happen this year on some of those other areas? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Yes. I can't project that. We're still growing that and we're happy with the progress in Prime Now and the service that – the value that it creates for Prime customers. And as I said, we have expanded internationally, which was a big goal of ours as well. So we will continue to grow that. I can't quantify it for you right now. The other similar like facility metric you might want is that AmazonFresh is now in 21 metro areas in the U.S. as well as London and Tokyo. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.

Please proceed with your question. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Got it. I saw on the front page of the release you're really focused on India. Can you give us a progress update on how you're doing? Any thoughts on how far you're willing to take the investment levels there? And what are your thoughts on maybe when international margins can start to make progress? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure, Justin. Thank you. Yes, I think Jeff's comments were pretty dead on. The launch of Prime last year was a big turning point. We've increased Prime selection by 75% since launching that nine months ago in India, also increased the fulfillment capacity for sellers by 26% this year. On the content side, we've announced A-Team in the original TV series and we're customizing the content, so it's a really vast selection of local and global movies and TV shows that are available to the Indian public. You'll also notice that the Fire TV Stick was – a new version of it was launched in India with some important features there such as the ability to search in Hindi and in English, free data usage for three months and also data monitoring, which is important there. So again, we continue to be encouraged by both the response from customers and sellers. As far as level of investment is concerned, it is certainly one of our important investment areas. We see a lot of potential for the country and our business there. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Any thoughts on how much it is impacting your international profitability? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. I can't quantify it, or break it out specifically, but I will say it's a large factor as well as a couple other things in the international segment. So, keep in mind that we launched Prime Video in the fourth quarter, and now we have that in over 200 countries and territories. We're spreading a lot of the Prime benefits that we see in North America to other countries. We just opened up Amazon Fresh in Tokyo last weekend, but also Prime Now. You saw other things like our business B2B business just opened up in the UK. We have Amazon Devices. So there's a lot of moving parts here. The other big influence is the same trends are happening in international with respect to FBA growth and the fact that our Amazon fulfill network, or the units we shipped, are growing at a much faster clip than our paid unit growth. Last year we said that was a 40% – nearly 40% growth worldwide. So we're making the investments in warehouses, fulfillment capacity and delivery capacity to handle that. So there's a lot going on in international. We are very encouraged with the growth of the Prime program, and we're hopeful for the Prime Video that we launched in the fall. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Two questions. The North American operating margins seem to come down like 70 bps year-over-year, and I know it's not big books view of the margins, I get that. But it's sort of a change. You've had margins be flat or up year-over-year for quite some time, and then they dipped down. Just could you explain that? And then secondly on these – on the Echo devices, the Echo family, Alexa devices that are coming out, could you comment at all about what kind of impact you're seeing in terms of increased wallet or per share within households? Are you seeing it have an impact in terms of Amazon customers more likely to spend more once they have these devices in particular categories like groceries or household products, pantry products that they're more likely to spend because they have these devices in their houses, in their kitchens, in their living rooms? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure, Mark. Let me start with the Echo question first. So, yeah, we're very encouraged by the customer response to the Echo products. Not only the Echo products but the ability to use tablets, our tablets now as Echo devices, since we've spread the Alexa technology to many of those devices. And we're also happy with the success we've had with developers. There's now over 12,000 Alexa skills. So we think that's all foundational. The monetization, as you might call it, is a theme of your questions. That's not our primary issue right now. It's about building great products and delighting customers. We think as engagement – as we pick up engagement with the devices, it helps the engagement with Amazon as a whole. So whether someone is ordering off their Alexa device or whether they're going to their phone, or going to their computer, it all has the same effect for us. So, very pleased with the initial progress. We see a lot of momentum there and we continue to invest. And that's one of the answers to your second question on North America operating margin. So if I step back, let me just talk generally about investments. So right now, we're just seeing a lot of great opportunities before us. And we're continuing to ramp up the investments in pursuit of those opportunities. And the big picture is, again, as we've said customers – the things customers love can grow to be large, we'll have strong financial returns and they're durable and can last for decades. So in that category, and some of the things that we're investing the most in are as you say the Echo and Alexa devices. We're doubling down on that investment, video content and marketing, not only in the U.S. but globally with the launch of our Prime Video in the fall. So, we're building global scale in that business in both content and marketing. As I said earlier, we're expanding Prime benefits in the U.S. and also globally. Things like Prime Music, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, all expanding globally. And we have launched Prime in India, China and Mexico. I know I'm drifting a bit from North America, but it's all part of the same theme. We also have this trend going on in our fulfillment networks where strong FBA growth and high growth in Amazon fulfilled unit is resulting in a large increase in fulfillment capacity. We're also investing in new technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning. You're starting to see some of that show up in things like Amazon Go, our beta store that we have developed in Seattle, drones. We use those technologies a lot in our internal businesses and we're also developing services for AWS customers. So – and that's of course another area is AWS continues to grow and add services and features and doing so at an accelerating rate. So there's a long list, and I can keep going. But I think the general theme is there's a lot of investment in front of us that we're optimistic about, and we continue to ramp those investments. In North America, that manifests itself mostly in the device area, the content area and also the expansion of the fulfillment networks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Amazon always had a pretty big focus on efficiencies. I'd be curious if you could talk about examples or areas where you have been able to iron out inefficiencies in the fulfillment process. And any still existing examples where you see low hanging fruit to really improve fulfillment efficiency? And then back to the point on investment. You didn't mention brick and mortar at all. There's been a lot of mention in the press about Amazon brick and mortar. I guess it would be curious to hear how you think about the importance of an Amazon brick and mortar presence and how that fits into the long-term strategy? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure thing. So, particularly as it pertains to our fulfillment center networks, I think the biggest areas of efficiency right now are in our Amazon Robotics areas. That technology continues to improve, and we have – we're now multiple generations down. We just launched am Amazon Robotics fulfillment center in the Tokyo area recently, and I toured that last month, and it's just amazing to see the strides that Amazon Robotics has taken and the efficiency we're getting in our warehouse as a result. The other efficiencies that we're seeing are network efficiencies, especially as we add things like sort centers. It's a collaboration and the movement between warehouses and sort centers and then to the end customer. The ability to have control through our sort centers has allowed us over the last few years to extend our cutoff times from 3:00 p.m. in most cases till midnight. So, greater control of our processes. If we do it cost effectively can also have favorable benefits both for our warehouse flow and also for our customers and their ordering pattern. So, there's a lot of efficiencies that are going on day-to-day around here. One of the benefits of rapid growth is the ability to create leverage on purchases and a lot of the processes that we run. So, your second question was on stores. Yes, I think you're seeing the expansion of our bookstores. We have six bookstores right now, and we have announced another six. The Amazon Go is in beta in Seattle, and while that's not large and only one site, we're excited about the potential there and the use of the technologies of computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning. We think that has a lot of potential. Again, it's only one location that's still in beta. But along with the bookstores, we also have – you'll see us in pop-up stores and college pickup points. So, for us it's another way to reach the customer and test what resonates with them, and we're pleased with the results. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I think you mentioned the accelerating growth within AWS on new products and last year you added about 1,000. Can you just talk about maybe the plans for AWS and product growth going forward here in 2017 and the focus on innovation? Thanks Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Yes, we haven't updated that number, but suffice to say the innovation pace continues to accelerate. We are very proud of the launches in Q4. The Amazon Connect, which we think will provide customer service capability to customers, and Amazon Chime, which we also believe will resonate with customers. We've had a lot of adoption of our new services. We've had – customers migrated more than 23,000 data basis using the AWS Database Migration Service since that launched last year. And just generally we continue to expand geographically. We have announced additional availability zones and regions worldwide. So, again, signed a number of big customers. I guess I would point out in the quarter, Liberty Mutual, Snap and Live Nation all starting relationships with us or expanding their current relationship. We're now over a $14 billion run rate. We're happy with the business and the team, and again, for us innovation is going to be key as we move forward. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Brian, I had a couple questions about your growing advertising business. We see more and more of it appearing on the site. And I was interested to hear a little bit more about how you expect that business to roll out internationally. I think it's largely U.S. based today, but be curious to hear about that. And then second, I think it's fairly obvious why someone selling within the Amazon ecosystem would be interested in promoting on the platform, but maybe tell us a little bit about maybe over the long-term there are opportunities for sort of non-endemic advertisers within your platform. Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Yeah, it's pretty early in the days with advertising, but we're very pleased with the team we have and the results. Our goal is to be helpful to consumers and enhance their shopping or their viewing experience with targeted recommendations, and we think a lot of the information we have and preferences of customers and recommendations help us do that for customers. We have a sponsored product, it's off to a great start, and it's a very effective way for advertisers to reach those especially interested customers. While you're on the topic of advertising, I thought I'd point out that in other revenue, advertising is in other revenue, as is co-branded credit card agreements and also some other advertising services. That decelerated from 99% in Q4 to 58% in Q1. But the fluctuation and the volatility was essentially in the co-branded credit card agreements and the other services, which can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on contract terms. And that's what happened. Advertising remained strong and was consistent growth with Q4. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thank you. So you periodically disclosed usage growth for AWS. But it has been some time since we saw one. So we're wondering if you can update us in terms of where you are now. If not, I mean, should we think about the growth in your cash deployment as an indicator of the ongoing growth? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Yes. Sorry, I don't have a usage number to share with you today. If it will help, I will tell you that, again, we're now over $14 billion run rate. You clearly see our – we break out very clearly our AWS segment revenue and operating income, and you'll also keep in mind that there's price decreases that are part of the business, and we're pretty public when we do those. And if you remember last call, I mentioned that we had seven price decreases that were timed for December 1. So, about a third of the impact of those was seen in Q4, and then again that's one element of the sequential operating margin. But in general, we're very happy with that team and the progress they're making. And we're deploying more capital as you can see to support the usage growth. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask you about CapEx. It looks like CapEx including leases more than doubled year-over-year. So I know you listed kind of a long list of the many investment opportunities here, but can you just point out anything else in particular that drove the pretty substantial increase there? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Yes, the CapEx, which is principally the fulfillment centers was – grew 51% year-over-year. As you'll remember, we added 26 warehouses last – fulfillment centers last year, 23 in the second half of the year. Some of that cost of start-up is before the start-up some comes in a quarter afterwards. So there was some carryover from that. But generally, the biggest trend here is that the differential between Amazon fulfilled network unit growth and paid unit growth. So that nearly 40% growth in Amazon fulfilled units last year, and the continuation of the strong growth higher than the paid unit growth that we see in 2017 is resulting in a lot of fulfillment center capacity. And the fulfillment centers I'll also say with the robotics technology tend to be more capital intensive than prior versions of warehouses, and then they generally have much better operating efficiencies and variable costs following their start-up. On the capital leases, that grew 45%. A good deal of that is tied to the AWS business. As I just mentioned, a lot of that is tied to usage growth. But a caution; CapEx can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, and if you look back to last year, the trailing 12 months was only 7% growth from the quarters through Q1 of last year. So certainly it was a bigger step-up in 2016 now carrying into 2017. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks. I know that we talked about over the last couple of quarters that part of the step-up in CapEx was to catch up from the under-investment in 2015. Just curious if you'd say – have you made a lot of progress in terms of catching up with some of the fulfillment needs that you saw necessary in the business at the beginning of last year? And then I know you just said that you're – it's still early days in terms of advertising, but there's a perception out there that over the last year or so that the company has sort of really begun to focus more on this business opportunity. Has something really changed at the business in the last year? And do you see advertising becoming a more meaningful part of the business over the near to midterm, I guess? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Let me start with advertising. So, yes, I think scale is helping. We've had great teams working on advertising for a while now. Our scale and number of customers, number of clicks, number of eyeballs, and new content – video content and other opportunities for advertising has really helped create some scale in that business. So we're very happy. I can't project it forward. But we're happy with the growth there. I think the sponsor products was a very inventive move for us, and I think that is having some really good impact on advertising growth. On your second point about fulfillment capacity; here's how I'd generally generalize it. In Q4 of 2015, we were pretty vocal or pretty transparent anyway that we ran out of space in Q4, especially due to some very strong demand for FBA space and services. Last year we changed some of our incentives and worked with FBA merchants to try and have better throughput through our FCs, particularly in Q4. That combined with the step-up in fulfillment centers that I mentioned, the 26 new ones, left us in a really good position. We had a very clean holiday, and we think it worked well for both customers, Amazon and also for sellers – for FBA sellers. So that leaves us now continuing to grow internationally as well because we continue to see strong FBA adoption, and it's a big part of our business, and it's a big part of our value with the additional Prime eligible ASNs that FBA provides. So, again, they're self-reinforcing, the FBA program and also our Prime program. The Prime program attracts more people to Amazon, and they buy more including FBA products and conversely more FBA products in our warehouses helps our in-stock of things that people want to buy, Prime eligible in-stock, and that helps reinforce the Prime program. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of how we should think about the increase in unearned revenue. Obviously, this quarter biggest increase that you have seen from at least from a dollar perspective. What does that say about the way customers are changing in the behavior in the AWS business? How should we think about the way that that might be impacting pricing, mix, near-term growth? Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc. Hi, Heath. This is Darin. Yeah, on a deferred revenue balances, as we've said in the past, the primary drivers of that increase are both the activity that we're seeing with our AWS customers and the purchase of Reserved Instances and prepaid credits for their account, as well as Prime member purchases. We're not breaking out the specific growth rates for Prime, but certainly it – we like what we see in terms of the growth, and it's been consistent with what we have seen over the last quarter or so. Certainly, the – part of that increase in deferred balances is related to Reserved Instances. As customers get more comfortable and begin to put more sustained workloads into the AWS services through buying RIs, they're able to get fairly significant discounts on their usage. And so we like that model. Customers certainly like that model. And collecting that through deferred revenue and then letting customers use that over time is very helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thank you. A question on the transportation and logistics initiatives. And in particular, if you could share any of the effects or learnings thus far with air cargo. In particular, what kind of performance or cost-efficiencies that you may be realizing or expect to realize from this effort. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure, Colin. As you point out, we're – we have expanded our own fleet. We now have 18 planes in service for Amazon, and we have announced rights to lease up to 40 planes. So it's gone very well. The ability to control shipments within our network has gone up, and we think the cost is very good. So on that front, it's better control, better capacity control, especially search capacity, and also good costs. So we have great relationships with third party carriers. We will continue to and we value all our partner relationships as we develop our own capability particularly in intra-network. We're putting it to good use, as I mentioned before, with the sortation center example. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Scott Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Hi. Thanks. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you are in terms of an investment in capabilities in India at this point and how you think about that market longer term. And then secondly, also if you could just comment on the limitations and your willingness to invest more throughout LatAm the way you have more recently in markets like China and India. And if I could, just finally, you've previously discussed satisfaction with the measurements of success for the video product in terms of consumer engagement, and the effects on Prime. I was just wondering if you could comment on whether these metrics are continuing to improve as spending continues to rise on video and consumer awareness is seemingly growing as well. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Let me start with your middle question. I think it was about Latin America growth. Let me step back and talk about international growth in general. So our approach varies by country, and if you look, historically we've taken multiple approaches. So in China, we bought an existing business Joyo.com and built off that base. In India, we started from scratch and have built a lot of things ourselves. And it's always going to depend on the country that the dynamics in that country both for retail, for online, and for foreign investment. But a real key factor in all of this generally is management bandwidth as well. So, we pick our spots carefully. You'll see – you heard in the quarter that we've announced the intention to buy Souq in the Middle East. Where does that fit into this strategy? Well, Souq's pioneered e-commerce in the Middle East, and they're creating great shipping experience for their customers and they're multiple countries, and they're doing a great job. So we see this as an example where we can learn from them, and also support their efforts with our Amazon technology and global resources. So we're in Mexico, but we're not in other parts of Latin America. We have a business in Brazil. But other countries we'll take on a case-by-case basis, again, bounded by what our management bandwidth can support and prioritization versus other things. You obviously heard my long list of investments. All of those are pretty much gated by the need for people and software engineers and strong teams to approach them. So international expansion gets played off in the same prioritization that other efforts do. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your questions. Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks. So is there just an accounting housekeeping a way to think about stock-based comp? You guys aren't providing that by segment anymore, but the rates of growth kind of differed by the businesses. And so is there just a way to think about, A, will that be in the queue? Or are you not disclosing it anymore? And is there a way to think about what I guess the patterns would be consistent with historical patterns by segment? Thanks. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc. Hi, Jason. This is Darin. Yes, we, a number of quarters back, started breaking out stock-based compensation by segment, and now we have collapsed that in our op income by segment. So it's definitely in there. We do provide some disclosure by P&L line item on a consolidated basis, that helps you identify that stock-based compensation expense in total and you'll see the trend and analysis and the metrics at the back of the press release. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I can take two away from the press release just to understand a little bit of the quarter-over-quarter cadence. On the retail subscription services, that saw a pretty big jump up in the growth rate year-on-year in Q1 versus Q4. I think that might be Prime memberships that come on to paid from trial. But just wanted to understand what maybe some of the driver was of that quarter-over-quarter in terms of the growth rate. And net shipping costs actually grew at the slowest rate by our count in a couple of years. It looks like you're starting to get some improvements there in terms of revenue over costs on the shipping line. Just wanted to know what that was in terms of what is driving that and can we expect that to possibly continue. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Let me start with the retail subscription services revenue. So there's multiple things in that category. The largest is Prime membership fees, but also other subscription services like audio books, eBooks, digital video, digital music, and other subscription services. So you're right, there was an acceleration, much like the comment I had on advertising and the other revenue category. The Prime membership growth rates for Q1 and Q4 last year are relatively consistent. So the volatility is in these other items. So I'm not quantifying the Prime membership or commenting on the growth rates, other than to say it's been very strong and Q4 strength has continued into Q1. Your comment on shipping costs, yeah, that is going to – it was lower unit volume as well, but generally, costs are going to be a combination of the tail – the headwinds are obviously going to be FBA growth and shipping more products ourselves and this expansion of our Prime program and the demand for products from our Prime customers. And the demand has been great. Again, there's over 50 million items that people can get delivered to their doorstep within two days or, in some cases, next day or same day. So it's going to be a big part of our cost structure but it's an investment we work hard to reduce as far as rates, and we're glad to spend it to support our Prime program. Operator Thank you. And our final question will come from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC Hi. Thanks. I had a follow-up and then a new question. The follow-up is, would love an update. You talked a lot about the fulfillment centers, but could you update us on where we are in terms of rolling out Prime Now facilities and sorting centers? You're just accounting a few – you feel that scenario, it's a really ramped up investment this year or what you got last year is sort of what you need? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. I'm sorry. You said Prime Now and what was the other thing? Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC And the sorting centers. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sort centers. Sort centers, right. Well, I don't have updated numbers for you, but the Prime Now is available in more than 45 cities across eight countries. The Same-Day is available in 30 cities in the U.S. So, that's a bit on the quantification of those. I can't tell you much more on sort centers. Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC But were you thinking about building out the capacity? It sounds like last year, you had that big surge in fulfillment centers. There isn't a similar surge about to happen this year on some of those other areas? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Yes. I can't project that. We're still growing that and we're happy with the progress in Prime Now and the service that – the value that it creates for Prime customers. And as I said, we have expanded internationally, which was a big goal of ours as well. So we will continue to grow that. I can't quantify it for you right now. The other similar like facility metric you might want is that AmazonFresh is now in 21 metro areas in the U.S. as well as London and Tokyo. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc. Thank you for joining us on our call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor Relations website, at least through the end of the quarter.

Baird & Co. Operator Good morning. My name is Shannon and I will be your conference operator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operation Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Beth Coronelli, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Coronelli, please go ahead. Beth Coronelli Thank you for joining us. Participating on the call with us today are Greg Cappelli, Chief Executive Officer of Apollo Education Group, and Greg Iverson; Chief Financial Officer. As we discuss our results today, unless noted otherwise, we will be comparing the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 to the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. I'd also like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements with respect to the future performance and financial condition of Apollo Education Group that involves risks and uncertainties. Various factors could cause actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors are discussed in our quarterly reports and Form 10-K filed with the SEC, and also on the 10-Q that was just filed this morning, both of which are available on our website. The company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call. Additionally we may refer to non-GAAP measures which are intended to supplement but not substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Our press release, available on our website, contains the financial and other quantitative information to be discussed today, as well as the reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures. And with that I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Cappelli. Gregory Cappelli Thank you, Beth. Good morning, everyone from Phoenix. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our conference call. Today I'd like to speak to three areas of focus that are primary drivers as we work to increase shareholder value for the long-term. First is the execution of our transformation plan at the University of Phoenix. We'll update you there. Second is the diversification and growth through Apollo Global. And, third, efforts to further adjust our cost base and simplify our operations. I'm then going to turn the call over to Greg Iverson, our Chief Financial Officer, to review our first-quarter results. Earlier this morning, we also released a statement that the Board of Directors has made a determination to pursue strategic alternatives. We won't be able to make any further comments at this time. As a consequence of that we will not be addressing the topic in our formal remarks. Let me start with the University of Phoenix where we are taking dramatic steps in making meaningful progress to further enhance student outcomes and to provide outstanding career-relevant higher education for working adults. Given the magnitude and scope of the changes being made, there's been a negative impact on enrollment and revenue so far in fiscal year '16, but the actions the University is taking we believe will lead to better outcomes including increased retention, which we're seeing early signs of. Adapting quickly to this rapidly evolving environment is best for our students and key to our long-term success. I'll just share a brief update on a number of the concrete actions that we're taking at University of Phoenix to implement the transformation plan. First, diagnostics and pathways, in piloting a more rigorous diagnostic we're assessing the cognitive and academic foundation of our incoming students, and we're learning that students who take the diagnostics enroll and pass their first course at a higher rate. Information gathered in the pilot is driving changes in the curriculum, course work, course sequencing and resources to address skills gaps for our incoming students in an effort to increase their academic success and engagement. We still plan to implement our enrollment diagnostic and admissions criteria this year across the entire university to help ensure we're enrolling students academically prepared for the rigors of a college degree program at the University of Phoenix. Second, our programs, the goal here is to reduce operational complexity and offer programs that are better aligned to direct job pathways. Our portfolio of associates programs has been reviewed to ensure they are aligned with existing industry credentials, as we adjust offerings and content to reflect feedback from employers. Nine associate degree programs were eliminated, and over 350 courses were refreshed during the first quarter. We continue to review our offerings to spotlight existing quality programs, develop new certificate and degree programs, and eliminate others, as appropriate. We've added significant expertise within each college as it pertains to ensuring we better understand employers' needs across the industry specialties and align our programs accordingly. Third, reducing course starts, our objective is to improve student retention and generate cost savings through thoughtfully reducing the number of program starts and course frequency. This will have an impact on enrollments and revenue relating to adjustments in existing student schedules to align to the new cadence. We believe this change will result in better student retention and satisfaction with more optimal class sizes and fewer course cancellations. Early indications suggest these changes will improve first course pass rates and lower withdraw rates. Finally, related to marketing, we're taking a renewed approach, including the elimination of the use of the affiliate channel in the first quarter. And we're focused on student fit, college specific messaging, increasing employer awareness of our programs, and the redesign of our Phoenix.edu website. We're working to rebuild our reputation with meaningful options step by step. You'll see the implementation of our new marketing campaign later this quarter. We believe these initiatives, along with our campus realignment and other actions we've taken previously will form the foundation for a stronger university with higher completion rates and improved student satisfaction, and will support our goal to transform University of Phoenix to a more trusted, focused, higher retaining and lower complexity institution. We continue to operate in a challenging regulatory environment. We've been responding to the Department of Defense's actions to put the university on probation for the department's tuition assistance program. We're working closely with the Department of Defense to be a good partner in the higher education of active duty military members and their families. Let me be clear, Apollo and University of Phoenix have taken very strong actions over the past 5 years to dramatically improve student protections. The list is long, including the elimination of recruiter comp based on enrollment levels. One of the first to institute a student tuition and debt calculator, mandatory three weeks of student orientation for college newcomers, that's prior to taking on student debt. A risk-free period, eliminating third-party marketing affiliates, and that's just to name a few. Our student loan default rates are significantly lower than just several years ago and now closing in on the national average. This organization has won the prestigious Ethisphere Compliance Verification Award to recognize our considerable ethics and compliance initiatives. And we remain committed to working with our regulators in order to drive the best compliance results possible, while playing a very important role in the education and training for working learners throughout the country. Next, let me quickly touch on Apollo Global which continues to expand into new geographies while growing organically, as well. We continue to build a worldwide presence for Apollo Global and I'm pleased to report every institution in global is growing. We expect organic revenue to grow close to 20% for fiscal year '16 on a constant currency basis, and in excess of 20%, including our newest acquisition. However, unlike prior years, Apollo Global is now cash flow positive, and as we further leverage our infrastructure we expect to deliver a minimum of $40 million of EBITDA in fiscal year '17. We're gaining economies of scale at global and are successfully collaborating across the institutions. In December, we closed on the acquisition of Career Partner in Germany. That's a premium higher education platform, which includes some of the most respected brands in businessman management, hospitality and tourism. The addition of CPG to Apollo Global allows us to expand our global network and is an opportunity to share best practices and build upon highly respected brands. Now I'd like to discuss our commitment to operating excellence and efficiency throughout Apollo. Given the speed and scope of the transformation we're making at University of Phoenix, we think it's prudent and necessary to ensure we continue to match our cost base with near-term revenue declines. There's no doubt that some of the initiatives we're taking are putting significant pressure on near-term enrollments, as I said before. But, as I also said last quarter, we're willing to sacrifice near-term revenue for long-term success. Therefore, I asked our organization to collaborate and to work together to find additional efficiencies where it makes sense that will allow us the runway to get through the transformation at University of Phoenix while maintaining the financial health of Apollo. This is a very significant initiative and I'm pleased with our progress so far. We are all committed and working together to the ongoing financial health of the organization going forward. As an side, we've hired a third party firm with deep education industry expertise to both validate the plan and help ensure the cost structure is consistent with achieving the transformation plan and the university's vision and objectives. Before I close I just want to quickly update you on an exciting development related to our B2B efforts. We're pleased to announce a new partnership with Genesis Rehabilitation Services, one of the nation's largest providers of rehabilitation services and a division of Genesis HealthCare, to develop scalable rehabilitation therapy training programs in China. There's a strong need to meet China's growing therapy needs, as the second largest healthcare market in the world, and we're honored to support Genesis in their efforts to meet this need and prepare aspiring healthcare professionals. We'll have more information as this contract unfolds. I'll now turn the call over to Greg Iverson. Greg Iverson Thanks, Greg. And good morning, everyone. To recap our consolidated results, revenue in the first quarter decreased 18% year-over-year to $586 million. We reported an operating loss for the first quarter of $45 million, which include goodwill impairment charges of $73 million, primarily representing the goodwill balance related to the University of Phoenix. This charge was not deductible for income tax purposes. Excluding special items, operating income was $54 million. Net loss from continuing operations attributable to Apollo in the first quarter was $58 million or $0.53 per share. Excluding special items, income from continuing operations was $31 million or $0.29 per share. Focusing first on the University of Phoenix, revenue in the first quarter was $463 million with an operating loss of $18 million. Excluding special items, operating income was $73 million. University of Phoenix enrolled 24,500 new students in the first quarter, down 38%. Total degreed enrollments was 176,900, a decrease of 22% year-over-year. Our first quarter new degreed enrollments were adversely affected by the transition to our reduced number of course starts per month, which we believe will improve the classroom experience and optimize class size. First quarter revenue per student was flat year-over-year. This reflects the impact of our price adjustments last year, which was offset by an increase in student scholarship awards and the impact of the reduced number of class starts. Class starts during this transition period reduced the average weeks students attend class and therefore the revenue recognized in the quarter. Discounts in the first quarter were 13% of revenue driven primarily by an increase in students receiving scholarships that reward progression toward graduation. We continue to expect discounts to be approximately 13% of revenue in 2016. Moving on to Apollo Global, first quarter revenue was $115 million with a reported operating loss of $2 million. Adjusting for depreciation and amortization and special items, Apollo Global's income was $8 million in the first quarter compared to $7 million in the prior year. On a constant currency basis Apollo Global grew double-digits in Q1 and we expect Global to grow in the mid 20%s, including the impact of the acquisition of Career Partner. Excluding the impact of Career Partner, organic growth at Apollo Global is expected to be in the high teens, close to the 20% long-term growth rate expectation for Apollo Global. As stated in our last call, we expect the Career Partner acquisition to contribute approximately $8 million of EBITDA annualized for 2016. Turning now to our operating expenses, in the first quarter, total operating expenses excluding special items decreased approximately $96 million or 15% year-over-year, primarily as a result of lower enrollments as well as continued reduction of our cost base. Our effective tax rate excluding special items for the first quarter was 43%. Excluding special items, and assuming the expected release of uncertain tax positions, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be about 47% for the full year. Our effective tax rate continues to be impacted by the decline in the pretax income of our domestic businesses and foreign tax losses that do not have an associated tax benefit. We expect this trend to reverse as Apollo Global becomes profitable. With respect to the consolidated balance sheet and cash flows at quarter end, our cash and marketable securities were approximately $756 million and our outstanding debt was $43 million. Our liquidity, which includes our cash and marketable securities and available borrowings on our $625 million credit facility, was $1.32 billion. Free cash flow for the quarter was an outflow of $33 million or $11 million excluding restructuring payments. Now I'd like to update you on our financial targets for 2016. Based on our current view we are targeting net revenue in the range of $2.14 billion to $2.18 billion. This range includes approximately $30 million of revenue for fiscal year '16 associated with the acquisition of Career Partner. Finally, we are targeting $115 million of operating income for 2016 excluding special items. This will require additional cost savings and we are increasing our gross cost savings commitment for 2016 to $400 million. Thank you. We will now take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Peter Appert Thanks, good morning. So Greg, I know you can't talk about the strategic review. But I'm wondering just how you can help us understand sort of the regulatory complexities of what you might have to think about in the context of the strategic review and particularly the change of control rules and regulations? Gregory Cappelli Peter, I understand your question and your focus. We've said as much as we can say on the topic. I just can't comment further on that press release. And when we have additional comments we're going to make them. So, I appreciate that, but we just can't comment further. Peter Appert Okay. How about, is 150,000 still the number you're thinking about in terms of the year end enrollment target? Gregory Cappelli Yes, I'll let Greg address that because we've been doing a lot of work on sort of de-risking the back half of the year and our targets and that to insure that we take out the appropriate amount of cost to align our cost base with potential revenue. So, Greg why don't you talk about that. Greg Iverson Peter, as Greg mentioned, we have de-risked our revenue forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year. And the revenue targets that we provided equate more closely with a ending enrollment in the 140,000 student range. Gregory Cappelli If you think of the number of initiatives that we're taking, fairly quickly, all in the fourth quarter of '15, first quarter of '16, we think they are extremely important, whether it's the diagnostics, the change in the start dates, the assessment on the front end and many others, the taking out of the associate programs, the affiliate channels, all in the light of improving outcomes. And we believe those are going to want to work and we want to give them room to work, even though it's a lot to do all at once, so we can come out the other side as quickly as possible. So we've looked at the whole year including going into next year and done what we thought we need to do, so that we can get our cost basis in order, in order to prepare for that, to preserve our financial health. Peter Appert Understood. And then, Greg, related to that, the DoD financial responsibility score, how big a risk is it that's something that could come to bite you in the context of some of these charges you're going to have to take? Gregory Cappelli Yes, it's a good question. I'll let Greg address that. Greg Iverson Yes. So, historically we've had a very strong composite score ratio for the last several years. This year, with the goodwill impairment charge that we recorded related to University of Phoenix, it’s reduced – it will reduce our composite score when reported at year end relative to where we've been at the past. But based on the financial projections that we outlined we still continue to believe that we have a reasonable level of cushion relative to the 1.5 threshold. Gregory Cappelli And if we needed to take further action there we would. Peter Appert Got it. And just one last thing, any programs you would call out, Greg, in terms of positives or negatives from an enrollment trend perspective? Gregory Cappelli Yes, I don't have that list of programs in front of me but there actually are. And there is a number of areas within the university and the colleges that are seeing, particularly in areas of healthcare in certain areas of the country, and in IT, where we're seeing some good results. There's signs of retention, as I said, in first course and second course completion rates. So, there are some good green shoots here and we want to make sure that we see that through for the entire fiscal year. Peter Appert Got it. Great. Thank you. Gregory Cappelli Thank you, Peter. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jeff Silber Thank you so much. I'm apologizing in advance, but I'm also going to ask a strategic alternatives question. And I've had folks ask me, if you can't comment then why did you have to issue a press release, was it something that your attorneys pushed you to do? Gregory Cappelli Yes, Jeff, what I can tell you is that the company put out the statement it's going to put out. And we've just said as much as we can say on the topics at this time. And, again, we'll have additional comments when we make them. But this is what we can say at the time. I apologize. Jeff Silber Okay. I understand. Just moving back to fundamentals, you mentioned the reduction in class starts. Can you just talk about I guess the order of magnitude what it was beforehand and what it is now? Gregory Cappelli Yes, sure. Greg do you want to take that? Greg Iverson So the biggest impacts from a financial perspective from the change in course starts we experienced in the first fiscal quarter, both from a new degreed enrollment standpoint, as well as for our continuing students who adjusted from our previous weekly starts to the less frequent new course start cadence. So, we believe the majority of the financial impact was reflected in our Q1 results. Gregory Cappelli And, Jeff, think about the strategy behind that, right, weekly starts are something that when you're dealing with hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people coming through, that were more appropriate for several years ago. But as the leadership of the university looks at the preparation of students that they want to have in working with them before they actually start the class, having a very healthy cohort, it makes everything less difficult and complex and the preparation levels are higher. And we expect, and we're already seeing students doing better that are starting in those cohorts. So the whole premise of everything that we're doing taking this near term pain is quickly as possible come out the other end. And this is something that the university leadership feels strongly will be a part of helping that. Jeff Silber I understand that. I guess, my question was, I know you were doing weekly starts beforehand. Can you just remind us how often the starts are right now? Gregory Cappelli Sure. In most cases it's monthly; in some cases it's twice a month. Jeff Silber Okay. So I just wanted to confirm that. Thanks so much. Gregory Cappelli Sure. Jeff Silber And then on the expense line items, I know you had alluded to the fact that there's potential for more cost cutting. But from a modeling perspective for the rest of the year is the first quarter kind of the run rate we should use? Obviously I understand the seasonality in the business, but beyond that, is that a good base for modeling the rest of the year? Greg Iverson I think if you look at our Q1 expenses relative to the prior year, you'll note there's a disproportionate decrease in both our marketing expense and our admissions advisory expense. So those are reflective of some of the actions that we took in the fiscal year, most notably the exit of the affiliate channel. So we will be experiencing reductions, I'd say, across the board in each of the different expense line items. But those are the two that were impacted on a disproportionate basis. Jeff Silber Okay. Great. That's very helpful. Thanks so much. Gregory Cappelli Thank you, Jeff. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Denny Galindo from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Denny Galindo Hi, there. Just to comment on starts trends, your starts are down 38% this quarter. Is this kind at the bottom or could it potentially get worse? So what are your thoughts on what starts are looking like for the next quarter and maybe for the whole year? Greg Iverson Sure, Denny. So our current projections - based on our current projections, based on a percentage decrease year-over-year, we are projecting that this current quarter is a trough period for enrollments and we're expecting some moderating of that trend on a go forward basis, I guess, with the exception of the second fiscal quarter which should be relatively in line with the first quarter. Gregory Cappelli Yes, and part of the thing that will be unfolding is a new pattern here, where you can imagine if you have less starts in certain periods over the last, call it, the holidays and December, how those classes build and form in January, February, and March, right, with those new start patterns. So we'll be providing an update on that on the next call. Denny Galindo Okay. And then the cash flow from operations was negative this quarter, which doesn't typically happen for you guys. Can you give us any thoughts on how the cash flow should develop over the next year, as well? I imagine you had some unusual expenses this particular quarter? Greg Iverson Yes. So we're - we continue to project to have positive free cash flow for the full year. So that's cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures. In the first quarter, as you noted, our free cash flow was negative and that was principally the result of some uses of cash from working capital, principally in the accounts receivable, accrued liabilities and restricted cash areas. Denny Galindo And then one other question just about Apollo Global, you have Germany now, you have BPP, Brazil, Mexico. Maybe you could talk about how much some of these assets use shared services in Apollo Global and how much are kin d of standalone managed at a country level? Gregory Cappelli They are sharing services and particularly in technology where they've built a really good capability there to help generate economies of scale. And they're sharing best practices in terms of what they're learning with new programs across the board. So I would say that Apollo Global is not operating as standalone institutions, that one of the major keys for any institution that we identify there is a good fit in. And any country that we think is a good fit is to make sure that there are ways to share best practices, and that, as a whole, the network can scale better and generate more value than just being a number of standalone institutions. It was never designed that way when we designed it from the beginning, and that's the way we continue to run the organization. Denny Galindo That's it for me. Thanks, guys. Gregory Cappelli Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Paul Ginocchio Greg, I don't think you're going to answer my question. But I was just going to ask you about the timing of this announcement. It just seems odd that you're announcing it when your new enrollment declines are at their worst. And why wouldn't you have just waited until, if some of these initiatives that you've just implemented in the last two quarters start to pay off, you'd be in a better position in a few quarters? It just seems a bit odd, the timing? Gregory Cappelli I understand your question and I've said what I can say about it. There's some language in the press release that's out this morning about the announcement. But I just can't say anything else about it. I do understand your question, but I apologize. Paul Ginocchio Great. And then you talked about positive free cash flow. Can you just tell - I think you said there was roughly, I think, $22 million of restructuring charges in the first quarter. Can you just talk about how much of the announced or planned restructuring for fiscal '16 plus the stuff you've done in the past, what are the restructuring charges that run through fiscal '16 and then what's the run-off into 2017, also? Greg Iverson So our current projections for restructuring charges, excluding the goodwill impairment for fiscal '16 is in the neighborhood of $100 million. And… Paul Ginocchio I'm talking about cash through balance sheet – sorry, cash through the cash flow statement? Greg Iverson Yes, our restructuring liability payments for fiscal '16, we're modeling at the same level. So that's going to be both a combination of cash payments on restructuring charges that we incurred in prior years along with cash payments associated with any 2016 actions. Paul Ginocchio And does that drop off significantly in fiscal '17 or is it broadly similar? Greg Iverson We're not providing outlook on fiscal '17 at this time. Paul Ginocchio I was just trying to ask about stuff that's already been done, how the run-off. But, okay, thank you. Greg Iverson Yes. Well, I mean, I can tell you that – and this information is generally in our 10-K, as well. The run-off cash payments associated with actions that we've announced to date in fiscal '17 is quite a bit lower than that fiscal '16 number I mentioned. Paul Ginocchio Thank you. Gregory Cappelli Thanks, Paul. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sara Gubins Hi, good morning. Gregory Cappelli Morning, Sara. Sara Gubins First, on the enrollment expectation of ending the year at about 140,000 versus 150,000 previously, could you talk to us about what's different than what you expected last quarter, just to try to understand it in the context of whether or not there might be factors that could cause it to move down further over the course of the year? Gregory Cappelli We tried to account for that the best we could with the number of initiatives that are going on. But clearly looking at those initiatives, right, and the rollout and the timing accounted for the change, right, in the enrollment projection for the year. I'll let Greg comment, as well. Greg Iverson As Greg mentioned, what we've tried to do is really de-risk our plan for the back half of the year. And so also, as Greg mentioned, there's so many things that are going on within the university, including the rollout of a new marketing campaign. And so, if you look at I guess, the financial factors that bridge between the past outlook and what I mentioned earlier in terms of enrollment in the 140,000 range, it's a combination of lower new degreed enrollment assumptions, especially at the very end of fiscal '16, as well as continue - the remaining effects of the course frequency change. Gregory Cappelli And we're using these numbers, again to set our cost basis for the remainder of the year and going into '17, and if they outperform those enrollment levels then we'll all be happy. Sara Gubins Okay. Great. And then the persistence trends, that improvement that you saw this past quarter, do you think we should continue to see improving trends? And could we see positive year-over-year movement in persistence, presumably at some point, but when would you expect to see it? Gregory Cappelli Yes, I mean, we would be disappointed if we didn't see those trends continue. That's the basis for taking all of these significant initiatives. So we realize that it takes time for that to play through. And some of the things, some of these initiatives students are just getting through their first couple courses. So, as we see 3Q - three-course and fourth-course completions we'll have a much better data of the magnitude of the follow through. That will be very helpful into the spring to provide you more data on that. But it is the whole reason that we're taking these steps. Sara Gubins Any way to help us think about the magnitude that you've incorporated into your revenue expectations? Gregory Cappelli Yes, Greg? Greg Iverson Yes, we have assumed some improvements in calculated persistence, really student retention, through the back half of the year, as a result of all the actions that the university is undertaking. Going back to a previous question around our outlook, I think we've risk-adjusted those assumptions somewhat. But it's our plan and our belief that we will see some positive trends in our persistence rates going forward. Sara Gubins Okay. The $400 million of cost cutting, that's the active cost cutting and then presumably there's more given the variable nature of student base coming down or is that $400 million the total? Greg Iverson $400 million is the total. That's all in including fixed and variable. Sara Gubins Okay. And then, last, could you talk a bit more about what's driving the strong organic growth at Global? And I'm sure it varies quite a bit by school and market. But I'm wondering if it's more marketing initiatives, new programs, new campus openings, particular markets that are performing better or worse than others? Gregory Cappelli It's a combination of things, Sara. We've acquired really good institutions who have only improved their ability to offer new programs and their accreditation standards and their most trusted status. They've gotten out ahead of the ball with certain changes, moving to online in certain programs, like in BPP where the whole industry changed in the PQ business and they were ahead of that. They have - a lot of the institutions that they're working with have gotten out ahead of the B2B trends, as well. So, if you think about the University of Phoenix it was built really B2C, with some business relationships as well, a lot of people already working. Some of the institutions in Global are very actively working on business relationships and B2B relationships, knowing that the consumer will follow, right, as they build as they build this. I'll just give you an example. BPP in the law school, they have over 50 exclusive agreements with the top law firms in the country. So they have just excellent relationships with businesses. They continue to build those. They're networking together. I mean, it’s driving - it's working, it's driving organic growth. Is everything perfect in every country? No, it's never going to be there. We're always going to be dealing with opportunities to improve and excel in certain countries. But as a whole, the management is doing an excellent job of working with each other across the board, building scale and improving institutions, while sharing best practices. So we like what we're seeing right now. Sara Gubins Thank you. Gregory Cappelli Thanks, Sara. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale from First Analysis. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Corey Greendale Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. Gregory Cappelli Morning. Corey Greendale First, again, sorry to go back to the thing you're not commenting on. But I just had a factual question I was hoping you could answer. I believe that a change in control could happen just with a purchase of the Class B shares without anything happening to the Class A. Is that correct? Gregory Cappelli I just can't comment on it. I'm sorry about that. There was a separate release put out on it from the board and I apologize that I don't have that information to comment on it. Corey Greendale Okay. And then on the fundamentals, a flip side question of what Sara asked, Global is doing well, but I think it did slow somewhat the growth from last quarter on a constant currency basis. Can you just comment on that and whether there's anything specific going on there and whether you expect that should reverse the next quarter? Gregory Cappelli Yes, that's a great question and, yes, there are some timing issues. Greg, why don't you talk about that? Greg Iverson Yes, I guess, the two things I'd call out, so one is, if you look at Apollo Global's results on the first quarter on a year-over-year basis, there was pretty significant revenue impacts from foreign currency. I think if you look at the delta caused by foreign currency it's in the ballpark of $13 million. And the other thing that we experienced in the first fiscal quarter relates to BPP. And so part of BPP's business is in the accountancy training space. So there is two key credentials there, ACCA and CMA. Both of the bodies that oversee those exams have moved from two exam sittings per year to between four and six exam sittings per year. So historically BPP has had a lot of this exam prep revenue in the first fiscal quarter and highly seasonal, as you can imagine, with just two exam sittings a year. So beginning this year and on a go-forward basis we would expect to see less seasonality in the BPP business across those two line items. Corey Greendale Okay. And then just one other quick one, it sounds like moving to mostly monthly starts has been largely, by and large, positive. Have you seen any negative impact on the show rate that was the one potential negative I saw about change? Greg Iverson No. From an operational standpoint, I think it's been a smooth rollout and we've seen some nice positive benefits. Corey Greendale Okay. Great. That's all I had. Thanks. Gregory Cappelli Thanks, Corey. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Trace Urdan from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Trace Urdan Hey, good morning. Gregory Cappelli Good morning, Trace. Trace Urdan I wanted to go back one more time, if I could, and maybe press Greg Iverson a little bit on the impact of the change in starts. Is there any way that you can help quantify a little bit more than you have? I know that you stated you thought the majority of the impact was contained in Q1. But either in terms of the percentage of the impact on the year that's contained in Q1 or maybe even just something more granular like how many starts you feel were impacted relative to the prior year, just to help us kind of frame how much of what we're looking at is what's happening in the market and how much of it is the result of these changes that you're making to your business. Gregory Cappelli Yes, we'll do our best here. Greg Iverson Sure. The impact in the first quarter was meaningful. So, all of the new students coming into the university who would have potentially started on a weekly basis now were delayed, delayed their enrollment. So, that had an impact. And then also, as we mentioned for the existing students it certainly had an impact on them, as well. So our estimates around the new degreed enrollment in the first fiscal quarter as a result of the rollout is about 1,700 students. Trace Urdan Okay. That's very helpful. And then a comparable question related to the Department of Defense probation, I know it's not going to be nearly as material, but can you help us think about that as well? Greg Iverson Sure. What we discussed in the past call and I think also in public releases is that the students who were impacted by the DoD probation status, we would expect to have an impact on our revenue of less than 1%. Trace Urdan Yes, I was more concerned about just the actual numbers of enrollments. Can you comment on that? Greg Iverson Well, I guess… Trace Urdan The impact on your revenue - the reason I ask is because the impact on a percentage basis, you have guys throwing out that 38% decline number. A relatively small number of students can impact that percentage number more than the relatively minimal impact on your revenue. So, that's the point of my asking. I want to sort of understand what - how many percentage points, if any, is it worth in terms of that? Greg Iverson Yes, it's a good question. And, as you probably know, those students who are part of the Department of Defense tuition assistance program pay a significantly lower tuition rate. It's a 250 credit level. So, you're absolutely right that less than 1% of revenue does equate to a disproportionately large number of students just based on the much lower tuition rate. Trace Urdan Okay, all right. I'll let you off the hook for that. And then the other question I had was, you guys report, in your release you talked to us about the operating income of the business units. Obviously there is some one-time expenses that are attached to the University of Phoenix and I was wondering if it was possible to quantify that. It looks like, if you add back 100% to the University of Phoenix, that we actually saw UOP margins expand year-over-year in the first quarter, and I'm wondering if I'm off base in thinking that or whether you can comment on that? Greg Iverson If you look back in the earnings release toward the end, we do have segment EBITDA for the different business units, including University of Phoenix. So hopefully that's helpful to see that level of detail excluding the restructuring charges. Trace Urdan Okay. I was looking at the operating income, but I'll take another look. Sorry about that. And then the final question, a little bit more esoteric, but, Greg Cappelli, when you guys have this pathway recommendation that's leading people to better outcomes, at least that you're seeing initially. How many different options are we talking about? Like, how much complexity is involved in recasting the course progression that the students are taking that are having this impact? Are we just really talking about one or two or three different changes that you recommend that they make relative to what you might have seen otherwise? Gregory Cappelli Well, the university and management is doing everything they can to make the institution less complex, right. It was very complex. It had gotten very big, many programs. And so the pathways is - and, again, it's been brought up, the negative 38%, yes. So a lot of that is from the very significant steps that we're taking to try to get through this as quickly as possible. But to your point, Trace, one of the things that we're trying to do is make it less complex along the way. So the way I would answer that is management of Phoenix is looking at that and just trying to get a clear idea of where you should be. So, if you should be starting in a certain cohort with at a certain level, right, with certain types of students at the University of Phoenix, they're going to put you in that. They have so much more information about you, right. It's not easy, always, taking the assessment, but in these pilots, but they are gathering the information. It's just a few different options, right, but it's to give you the best chance. And some of those students will come back to the university after they've done the preparation that they need. We know that. So it's to provide the person with the best opportunity and the most honest assessment for their well being. And we feel that if we do that they're going to end up in a great place or back at the university when it's appropriate. Trace Urdan Okay. So last call I think Jeff asked you and you answered it and it was very helpful, you talked about maybe sending somebody to a community college, for example and recommending they take some courses and come back. I think as an alternative pathway to better prepare them, that makes a lot of sense. My question was more to do, you seem to be implying that - and maybe I got this wrong. But you seem to be implying that for the students that are starting, you're making recommendations to them about different things that they could be doing. Is that not the case? Are we just talking about screening better at the front? Gregory Cappelli I'm talking about after the assessment but before starting is the recommendation of where they should be, and cohorting students better, so they have a better experience with the level of student that they're with in the classroom. Those are things that they're working on. So, I'm sorry, Trace, its pre actually starting. Trace Urdan No, I was just trying to get a little bit more of a feel for exactly what we're talking about and making it a little bit less abstract. So, you're saying that basically some of the students might for example, require more remedial preparation in math, so they would be put together with other students that have that same need and they would be sort of in that cohort. Is that what you're talking about? I'm just trying to get a feel for what we're describing here? Gregory Cappelli Sure. The admissions and the pathways have not been completely implemented. That's what these pilots are for. They are determining sort of the cut scores for the products. There is really three paths. There is advanced, there is standard and there is something like go to a community college, right? So, it's not meant to be very complex. It's supposed to be straightforward, less complex, but very clear to the individual. And they're really doing some great work there with the data that they're getting back. Trace Urdan And how - sorry, last question, how - when can we expect that this process will be sort of fully worked out and implemented? It sounds like you're still figuring things out… Gregory Cappelli And these have been big pilots, right, with a lot of impact. So I don't want to imply that they haven't. We've given out some data on that in the past. In some cases where it's affected 20% of the starts or more, that has a bigger impact than if you think about dealing with the funnel of students coming in, because some are choosing not to take the diagnostic at all, which tells you something about the student's commitment there, as well. So - but there's going to be major work done throughout this fiscal year. I think going into '17 we'll be in a great place where things will be humming along more complete. But they want to get it really really right. And to their credit at the University of Phoenix, they are piloting making changes, piloting getting data, making adjustments, and it's just getting better and better. So a lot of credit goes. The team is putting in a lot of work and they want to do it the right way. If this were about trying to make sure that we're at a certain enrollment level every quarter, then it would be a different story, but we're not doing that. We want the best outcomes and we want the transformation to go as soon as possible despite the near term consequences. And that's why we have to manage our costs. We have to give ourselves that runway so we can get through this. Trace Urdan Okay. Thanks, Greg. Gregory Cappelli Thanks so much, Trace. Operator Your last question comes from the line of Jeff Mueller [Robert W. Baird & Co.] Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jeff Mueller Yes, thank you. Can you just give us a refresher on the ownership of the voting shares? I think there was a Form 4 about a collateral call on some shares to fulfill a loan. But I don't recall if those are voting shares or not. So, any refresher you could give us on the voting stock ownership. Gregory Cappelli Jeff, I'm sorry, I don't have that information in front of me. I do recall obviously the filing there. And I don’t - I just don't have any further data. I think those were A shares, but I don't have that. I'm pretty sure they were, actually. But I can research that a little bit for you. But that was all disclosed in a prior filing. So… Jeff Mueller Okay. Gregory Cappelli I'm sure those were A shares. Jeff Mueller Okay. And then the $40 million minimum EBITDA target for Global in '17, is that inclusive or exclusive of the contribution from the German acquisition? Greg Iverson That is inclusive. So, now that we've included the partial year results for Career Partner, we're expecting EBITDA for '16 to be in excess of $40 million now for fiscal '16. Jeff Mueller Okay. And then can you give us a sense of the breadth of profitability in Global? You've done a few acquisitions of I guess, Germany and open colleges and that have been profitable, and then you're improving BPP. So, just any way you can frame up the breadth of the profitability. Is it concentrated in just a few institutions or is it pretty broad? Gregory Cappelli Well, I mean, it's a great question. We are looking at – I mean, profitability matters a lot to us in Global. There are some things, when we look at valuing the organization and creating long-term value, where local accounting revenue rack and things like that are different than we convert to in the US. So, we will follow that very clearly in the US. But that's why we look at EBITDA and cash, because that to us is the ultimate barometer for creating value. And I'll let Greg speak to that a little bit more. Greg Iverson Yes, first I want to just correct something I said to answer your last question. That $40 million of EBITDA obviously refers to fiscal '17, not to fiscal '16. But with regard to the composition of Apollo Global, so as we've said in the past, BPP is more than half of the revenue of Apollo Global. So it's clearly the largest institution. It's one of the institutions we've owned for the longest period of time. And so we are seeing some very significant - or starting to see some revenue growth there and also, importantly, some better leveraging of our fixed cost base. So we are seeing, as Greg mentioned, revenue gains in each of the different business units. But, to your point, just given BPP's size relative to the whole Apollo Global portfolio, we definitely see a disproportionate amount of our EBITDA, both this year and next year. Gregory Cappelli They've been through the transformation. The management has done an incredible job going through a very tough market there, sort of '09, '10, '11, taking the necessary steps, transforming, doing what they need to do, in a similar way to what's going on here to get improved relationships, outcomes, status. And it's working so their profitability has moved up nicely. They addressed the costs early on, which wasn't easy. I will say this too, Jeff, that when you look at certain institutions around the globe, some are making some meaningful investments. So if we're opening up a number of new locations in Mexico, right, that's going to have an impact or if we're investing in Brazil or in open colleges, that's going to have an impact. But we look at all that closely, we look at returns and incremental invested capital. We care very, very much about measuring the near term results, but also the long-term value that can be created. So that's how we assess the level of investment and the offset to profitability near term. Does that help? Jeff Mueller Okay. It does. And then just one more for me. On Global, I just want to make sure I have it right. I think that it was 20% organic constant currency growth last year. That's also the five-year long-term target. But you're saying dipping down maybe to the high teens this year. I know it's not a big change, but the only factors I heard were BPP timing and FX. So, is there anything worth calling out that's potentially driving a bit of deceleration in Global organic constant currency this year? Gregory Cappelli Not really. I mean, there's nothing that stands out. Whether its high teens or 20% it's going to be -call it 15% to 20%, it's going to be in a range, depending upon the timing and level of investments. But I don't see anything as I look across the organization to point to, other than the timing of things that Greg mentioned like the change in the number of times you can take exams and tests and things like that at BPP. If there is something that's more meaningful we'll call it out going forward. Jeff Mueller Fair enough. Thank you, guys. Gregory Cappelli Thanks so much. Operator As there are no further questions on the phone lines at this time, I would now turn the call back to Greg Cappelli. Gregory Cappelli All right. Thank you so much, everybody for listening this morning and for your understanding. And we'll look forward to following up and talking to you again soon. Take care.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Peter Appert Thanks, good morning. So Greg, I know you can't talk about the strategic review. But I'm wondering just how you can help us understand sort of the regulatory complexities of what you might have to think about in the context of the strategic review and particularly the change of control rules and regulations? Gregory Cappelli Peter, I understand your question and your focus. We've said as much as we can say on the topic. I just can't comment further on that press release. And when we have additional comments we're going to make them. So, I appreciate that, but we just can't comment further. Peter Appert Okay. How about, is 150,000 still the number you're thinking about in terms of the year end enrollment target? Gregory Cappelli Yes, I'll let Greg address that because we've been doing a lot of work on sort of de-risking the back half of the year and our targets and that to insure that we take out the appropriate amount of cost to align our cost base with potential revenue. So, Greg why don't you talk about that. Greg Iverson Peter, as Greg mentioned, we have de-risked our revenue forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year. And the revenue targets that we provided equate more closely with a ending enrollment in the 140,000 student range. Gregory Cappelli If you think of the number of initiatives that we're taking, fairly quickly, all in the fourth quarter of '15, first quarter of '16, we think they are extremely important, whether it's the diagnostics, the change in the start dates, the assessment on the front end and many others, the taking out of the associate programs, the affiliate channels, all in the light of improving outcomes. And we believe those are going to want to work and we want to give them room to work, even though it's a lot to do all at once, so we can come out the other side as quickly as possible. So we've looked at the whole year including going into next year and done what we thought we need to do, so that we can get our cost basis in order, in order to prepare for that, to preserve our financial health. Peter Appert Understood. And then, Greg, related to that, the DoD financial responsibility score, how big a risk is it that's something that could come to bite you in the context of some of these charges you're going to have to take? Gregory Cappelli Yes, it's a good question. I'll let Greg address that. Greg Iverson Yes. So, historically we've had a very strong composite score ratio for the last several years. This year, with the goodwill impairment charge that we recorded related to University of Phoenix, it’s reduced – it will reduce our composite score when reported at year end relative to where we've been at the past. But based on the financial projections that we outlined we still continue to believe that we have a reasonable level of cushion relative to the 1.5 threshold. Gregory Cappelli And if we needed to take further action there we would. Peter Appert Got it. And just one last thing, any programs you would call out, Greg, in terms of positives or negatives from an enrollment trend perspective? Gregory Cappelli Yes, I don't have that list of programs in front of me but there actually are. And there is a number of areas within the university and the colleges that are seeing, particularly in areas of healthcare in certain areas of the country, and in IT, where we're seeing some good results. There's signs of retention, as I said, in first course and second course completion rates. So, there are some good green shoots here and we want to make sure that we see that through for the entire fiscal year. Peter Appert Got it. Great. Thank you. Gregory Cappelli Thank you, Peter. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jeff Silber Thank you so much. I'm apologizing in advance, but I'm also going to ask a strategic alternatives question. And I've had folks ask me, if you can't comment then why did you have to issue a press release, was it something that your attorneys pushed you to do? Gregory Cappelli Yes, Jeff, what I can tell you is that the company put out the statement it's going to put out. And we've just said as much as we can say on the topics at this time. And, again, we'll have additional comments when we make them. But this is what we can say at the time. I apologize. Jeff Silber Okay. I understand. Just moving back to fundamentals, you mentioned the reduction in class starts. Can you just talk about I guess the order of magnitude what it was beforehand and what it is now? Gregory Cappelli Yes, sure. Greg do you want to take that? Greg Iverson So the biggest impacts from a financial perspective from the change in course starts we experienced in the first fiscal quarter, both from a new degreed enrollment standpoint, as well as for our continuing students who adjusted from our previous weekly starts to the less frequent new course start cadence. So, we believe the majority of the financial impact was reflected in our Q1 results. Gregory Cappelli And, Jeff, think about the strategy behind that, right, weekly starts are something that when you're dealing with hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people coming through, that were more appropriate for several years ago. But as the leadership of the university looks at the preparation of students that they want to have in working with them before they actually start the class, having a very healthy cohort, it makes everything less difficult and complex and the preparation levels are higher. And we expect, and we're already seeing students doing better that are starting in those cohorts. So the whole premise of everything that we're doing taking this near term pain is quickly as possible come out the other end. And this is something that the university leadership feels strongly will be a part of helping that. Jeff Silber I understand that. I guess, my question was, I know you were doing weekly starts beforehand. Can you just remind us how often the starts are right now? Gregory Cappelli Sure. In most cases it's monthly; in some cases it's twice a month. Jeff Silber Okay. So I just wanted to confirm that. Thanks so much. Gregory Cappelli Sure. Jeff Silber And then on the expense line items, I know you had alluded to the fact that there's potential for more cost cutting. But from a modeling perspective for the rest of the year is the first quarter kind of the run rate we should use? Obviously I understand the seasonality in the business, but beyond that, is that a good base for modeling the rest of the year? Greg Iverson I think if you look at our Q1 expenses relative to the prior year, you'll note there's a disproportionate decrease in both our marketing expense and our admissions advisory expense. So those are reflective of some of the actions that we took in the fiscal year, most notably the exit of the affiliate channel. So we will be experiencing reductions, I'd say, across the board in each of the different expense line items. But those are the two that were impacted on a disproportionate basis. Jeff Silber Okay. Great. That's very helpful. Thanks so much. Gregory Cappelli Thank you, Jeff. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Denny Galindo from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Denny Galindo Hi, there. Just to comment on starts trends, your starts are down 38% this quarter. Is this kind at the bottom or could it potentially get worse? So what are your thoughts on what starts are looking like for the next quarter and maybe for the whole year? Greg Iverson Sure, Denny. So our current projections - based on our current projections, based on a percentage decrease year-over-year, we are projecting that this current quarter is a trough period for enrollments and we're expecting some moderating of that trend on a go forward basis, I guess, with the exception of the second fiscal quarter which should be relatively in line with the first quarter. Gregory Cappelli Yes, and part of the thing that will be unfolding is a new pattern here, where you can imagine if you have less starts in certain periods over the last, call it, the holidays and December, how those classes build and form in January, February, and March, right, with those new start patterns. So we'll be providing an update on that on the next call. Denny Galindo Okay. And then the cash flow from operations was negative this quarter, which doesn't typically happen for you guys. Can you give us any thoughts on how the cash flow should develop over the next year, as well? I imagine you had some unusual expenses this particular quarter? Greg Iverson Yes. So we're - we continue to project to have positive free cash flow for the full year. So that's cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures. In the first quarter, as you noted, our free cash flow was negative and that was principally the result of some uses of cash from working capital, principally in the accounts receivable, accrued liabilities and restricted cash areas. Denny Galindo And then one other question just about Apollo Global, you have Germany now, you have BPP, Brazil, Mexico. Maybe you could talk about how much some of these assets use shared services in Apollo Global and how much are kin d of standalone managed at a country level? Gregory Cappelli They are sharing services and particularly in technology where they've built a really good capability there to help generate economies of scale. And they're sharing best practices in terms of what they're learning with new programs across the board. So I would say that Apollo Global is not operating as standalone institutions, that one of the major keys for any institution that we identify there is a good fit in. And any country that we think is a good fit is to make sure that there are ways to share best practices, and that, as a whole, the network can scale better and generate more value than just being a number of standalone institutions. It was never designed that way when we designed it from the beginning, and that's the way we continue to run the organization. Denny Galindo That's it for me. Thanks, guys. Gregory Cappelli Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Paul Ginocchio Greg, I don't think you're going to answer my question. But I was just going to ask you about the timing of this announcement. It just seems odd that you're announcing it when your new enrollment declines are at their worst. And why wouldn't you have just waited until, if some of these initiatives that you've just implemented in the last two quarters start to pay off, you'd be in a better position in a few quarters? It just seems a bit odd, the timing? Gregory Cappelli I understand your question and I've said what I can say about it. There's some language in the press release that's out this morning about the announcement. But I just can't say anything else about it. I do understand your question, but I apologize. Paul Ginocchio Great. And then you talked about positive free cash flow. Can you just tell - I think you said there was roughly, I think, $22 million of restructuring charges in the first quarter. Can you just talk about how much of the announced or planned restructuring for fiscal '16 plus the stuff you've done in the past, what are the restructuring charges that run through fiscal '16 and then what's the run-off into 2017, also? Greg Iverson So our current projections for restructuring charges, excluding the goodwill impairment for fiscal '16 is in the neighborhood of $100 million. And… Paul Ginocchio I'm talking about cash through balance sheet – sorry, cash through the cash flow statement? Greg Iverson Yes, our restructuring liability payments for fiscal '16, we're modeling at the same level. So that's going to be both a combination of cash payments on restructuring charges that we incurred in prior years along with cash payments associated with any 2016 actions. Paul Ginocchio And does that drop off significantly in fiscal '17 or is it broadly similar? Greg Iverson We're not providing outlook on fiscal '17 at this time. Paul Ginocchio I was just trying to ask about stuff that's already been done, how the run-off. But, okay, thank you. Greg Iverson Yes. Well, I mean, I can tell you that – and this information is generally in our 10-K, as well. The run-off cash payments associated with actions that we've announced to date in fiscal '17 is quite a bit lower than that fiscal '16 number I mentioned. Paul Ginocchio Thank you. Gregory Cappelli Thanks, Paul. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sara Gubins Hi, good morning. Gregory Cappelli Morning, Sara. Sara Gubins First, on the enrollment expectation of ending the year at about 140,000 versus 150,000 previously, could you talk to us about what's different than what you expected last quarter, just to try to understand it in the context of whether or not there might be factors that could cause it to move down further over the course of the year? Gregory Cappelli We tried to account for that the best we could with the number of initiatives that are going on. But clearly looking at those initiatives, right, and the rollout and the timing accounted for the change, right, in the enrollment projection for the year. I'll let Greg comment, as well. Greg Iverson As Greg mentioned, what we've tried to do is really de-risk our plan for the back half of the year. And so also, as Greg mentioned, there's so many things that are going on within the university, including the rollout of a new marketing campaign. And so, if you look at I guess, the financial factors that bridge between the past outlook and what I mentioned earlier in terms of enrollment in the 140,000 range, it's a combination of lower new degreed enrollment assumptions, especially at the very end of fiscal '16, as well as continue - the remaining effects of the course frequency change. Gregory Cappelli And we're using these numbers, again to set our cost basis for the remainder of the year and going into '17, and if they outperform those enrollment levels then we'll all be happy. Sara Gubins Okay. Great. And then the persistence trends, that improvement that you saw this past quarter, do you think we should continue to see improving trends? And could we see positive year-over-year movement in persistence, presumably at some point, but when would you expect to see it? Gregory Cappelli Yes, I mean, we would be disappointed if we didn't see those trends continue. That's the basis for taking all of these significant initiatives. So we realize that it takes time for that to play through. And some of the things, some of these initiatives students are just getting through their first couple courses. So, as we see 3Q - three-course and fourth-course completions we'll have a much better data of the magnitude of the follow through. That will be very helpful into the spring to provide you more data on that. But it is the whole reason that we're taking these steps. Sara Gubins Any way to help us think about the magnitude that you've incorporated into your revenue expectations? Gregory Cappelli Yes, Greg? Greg Iverson Yes, we have assumed some improvements in calculated persistence, really student retention, through the back half of the year, as a result of all the actions that the university is undertaking. Going back to a previous question around our outlook, I think we've risk-adjusted those assumptions somewhat. But it's our plan and our belief that we will see some positive trends in our persistence rates going forward. Sara Gubins Okay. The $400 million of cost cutting, that's the active cost cutting and then presumably there's more given the variable nature of student base coming down or is that $400 million the total? Greg Iverson $400 million is the total. That's all in including fixed and variable. Sara Gubins Okay. And then, last, could you talk a bit more about what's driving the strong organic growth at Global? And I'm sure it varies quite a bit by school and market. But I'm wondering if it's more marketing initiatives, new programs, new campus openings, particular markets that are performing better or worse than others? Gregory Cappelli It's a combination of things, Sara. We've acquired really good institutions who have only improved their ability to offer new programs and their accreditation standards and their most trusted status. They've gotten out ahead of the ball with certain changes, moving to online in certain programs, like in BPP where the whole industry changed in the PQ business and they were ahead of that. They have - a lot of the institutions that they're working with have gotten out ahead of the B2B trends, as well. So, if you think about the University of Phoenix it was built really B2C, with some business relationships as well, a lot of people already working. Some of the institutions in Global are very actively working on business relationships and B2B relationships, knowing that the consumer will follow, right, as they build as they build this. I'll just give you an example. BPP in the law school, they have over 50 exclusive agreements with the top law firms in the country. So they have just excellent relationships with businesses. They continue to build those. They're networking together. I mean, it’s driving - it's working, it's driving organic growth. Is everything perfect in every country? No, it's never going to be there. We're always going to be dealing with opportunities to improve and excel in certain countries. But as a whole, the management is doing an excellent job of working with each other across the board, building scale and improving institutions, while sharing best practices. So we like what we're seeing right now. Sara Gubins Thank you. Gregory Cappelli Thanks, Sara. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Corey Greendale from First Analysis. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Corey Greendale Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. Gregory Cappelli Morning. Corey Greendale First, again, sorry to go back to the thing you're not commenting on. But I just had a factual question I was hoping you could answer. I believe that a change in control could happen just with a purchase of the Class B shares without anything happening to the Class A. Is that correct? Gregory Cappelli I just can't comment on it. I'm sorry about that. There was a separate release put out on it from the board and I apologize that I don't have that information to comment on it. Corey Greendale Okay. And then on the fundamentals, a flip side question of what Sara asked, Global is doing well, but I think it did slow somewhat the growth from last quarter on a constant currency basis. Can you just comment on that and whether there's anything specific going on there and whether you expect that should reverse the next quarter? Gregory Cappelli Yes, that's a great question and, yes, there are some timing issues. Greg, why don't you talk about that? Greg Iverson Yes, I guess, the two things I'd call out, so one is, if you look at Apollo Global's results on the first quarter on a year-over-year basis, there was pretty significant revenue impacts from foreign currency. I think if you look at the delta caused by foreign currency it's in the ballpark of $13 million. And the other thing that we experienced in the first fiscal quarter relates to BPP. And so part of BPP's business is in the accountancy training space. So there is two key credentials there, ACCA and CMA. Both of the bodies that oversee those exams have moved from two exam sittings per year to between four and six exam sittings per year. So historically BPP has had a lot of this exam prep revenue in the first fiscal quarter and highly seasonal, as you can imagine, with just two exam sittings a year. So beginning this year and on a go-forward basis we would expect to see less seasonality in the BPP business across those two line items. Corey Greendale Okay. And then just one other quick one, it sounds like moving to mostly monthly starts has been largely, by and large, positive. Have you seen any negative impact on the show rate that was the one potential negative I saw about change? Greg Iverson No. From an operational standpoint, I think it's been a smooth rollout and we've seen some nice positive benefits. Corey Greendale Okay. Great. That's all I had. Thanks. Gregory Cappelli Thanks, Corey. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Trace Urdan from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Trace Urdan Hey, good morning. Gregory Cappelli Good morning, Trace. Trace Urdan I wanted to go back one more time, if I could, and maybe press Greg Iverson a little bit on the impact of the change in starts. Is there any way that you can help quantify a little bit more than you have? I know that you stated you thought the majority of the impact was contained in Q1. But either in terms of the percentage of the impact on the year that's contained in Q1 or maybe even just something more granular like how many starts you feel were impacted relative to the prior year, just to help us kind of frame how much of what we're looking at is what's happening in the market and how much of it is the result of these changes that you're making to your business. Gregory Cappelli Yes, we'll do our best here. Greg Iverson Sure. The impact in the first quarter was meaningful. So, all of the new students coming into the university who would have potentially started on a weekly basis now were delayed, delayed their enrollment. So, that had an impact. And then also, as we mentioned for the existing students it certainly had an impact on them, as well. So our estimates around the new degreed enrollment in the first fiscal quarter as a result of the rollout is about 1,700 students. Trace Urdan Okay. That's very helpful. And then a comparable question related to the Department of Defense probation, I know it's not going to be nearly as material, but can you help us think about that as well? Greg Iverson Sure. What we discussed in the past call and I think also in public releases is that the students who were impacted by the DoD probation status, we would expect to have an impact on our revenue of less than 1%. Trace Urdan Yes, I was more concerned about just the actual numbers of enrollments. Can you comment on that? Greg Iverson Well, I guess… Trace Urdan The impact on your revenue - the reason I ask is because the impact on a percentage basis, you have guys throwing out that 38% decline number. A relatively small number of students can impact that percentage number more than the relatively minimal impact on your revenue. So, that's the point of my asking. I want to sort of understand what - how many percentage points, if any, is it worth in terms of that? Greg Iverson Yes, it's a good question. And, as you probably know, those students who are part of the Department of Defense tuition assistance program pay a significantly lower tuition rate. It's a 250 credit level. So, you're absolutely right that less than 1% of revenue does equate to a disproportionately large number of students just based on the much lower tuition rate. Trace Urdan Okay, all right. I'll let you off the hook for that. And then the other question I had was, you guys report, in your release you talked to us about the operating income of the business units. Obviously there is some one-time expenses that are attached to the University of Phoenix and I was wondering if it was possible to quantify that. It looks like, if you add back 100% to the University of Phoenix, that we actually saw UOP margins expand year-over-year in the first quarter, and I'm wondering if I'm off base in thinking that or whether you can comment on that? Greg Iverson If you look back in the earnings release toward the end, we do have segment EBITDA for the different business units, including University of Phoenix. So hopefully that's helpful to see that level of detail excluding the restructuring charges. Trace Urdan Okay. I was looking at the operating income, but I'll take another look. Sorry about that. And then the final question, a little bit more esoteric, but, Greg Cappelli, when you guys have this pathway recommendation that's leading people to better outcomes, at least that you're seeing initially. How many different options are we talking about? Like, how much complexity is involved in recasting the course progression that the students are taking that are having this impact? Are we just really talking about one or two or three different changes that you recommend that they make relative to what you might have seen otherwise? Gregory Cappelli Well, the university and management is doing everything they can to make the institution less complex, right. It was very complex. It had gotten very big, many programs. And so the pathways is - and, again, it's been brought up, the negative 38%, yes. So a lot of that is from the very significant steps that we're taking to try to get through this as quickly as possible. But to your point, Trace, one of the things that we're trying to do is make it less complex along the way. So the way I would answer that is management of Phoenix is looking at that and just trying to get a clear idea of where you should be. So, if you should be starting in a certain cohort with at a certain level, right, with certain types of students at the University of Phoenix, they're going to put you in that. They have so much more information about you, right. It's not easy, always, taking the assessment, but in these pilots, but they are gathering the information. It's just a few different options, right, but it's to give you the best chance. And some of those students will come back to the university after they've done the preparation that they need. We know that. So it's to provide the person with the best opportunity and the most honest assessment for their well being. And we feel that if we do that they're going to end up in a great place or back at the university when it's appropriate. Trace Urdan Okay. So last call I think Jeff asked you and you answered it and it was very helpful, you talked about maybe sending somebody to a community college, for example and recommending they take some courses and come back. I think as an alternative pathway to better prepare them, that makes a lot of sense. My question was more to do, you seem to be implying that - and maybe I got this wrong. But you seem to be implying that for the students that are starting, you're making recommendations to them about different things that they could be doing. Is that not the case? Are we just talking about screening better at the front? Gregory Cappelli I'm talking about after the assessment but before starting is the recommendation of where they should be, and cohorting students better, so they have a better experience with the level of student that they're with in the classroom. Those are things that they're working on. So, I'm sorry, Trace, its pre actually starting. Trace Urdan No, I was just trying to get a little bit more of a feel for exactly what we're talking about and making it a little bit less abstract. So, you're saying that basically some of the students might for example, require more remedial preparation in math, so they would be put together with other students that have that same need and they would be sort of in that cohort. Is that what you're talking about? I'm just trying to get a feel for what we're describing here? Gregory Cappelli Sure. The admissions and the pathways have not been completely implemented. That's what these pilots are for. They are determining sort of the cut scores for the products. There is really three paths. There is advanced, there is standard and there is something like go to a community college, right? So, it's not meant to be very complex. It's supposed to be straightforward, less complex, but very clear to the individual. And they're really doing some great work there with the data that they're getting back. Trace Urdan And how - sorry, last question, how - when can we expect that this process will be sort of fully worked out and implemented? It sounds like you're still figuring things out… Gregory Cappelli And these have been big pilots, right, with a lot of impact. So I don't want to imply that they haven't. We've given out some data on that in the past. In some cases where it's affected 20% of the starts or more, that has a bigger impact than if you think about dealing with the funnel of students coming in, because some are choosing not to take the diagnostic at all, which tells you something about the student's commitment there, as well. So - but there's going to be major work done throughout this fiscal year. I think going into '17 we'll be in a great place where things will be humming along more complete. But they want to get it really really right. And to their credit at the University of Phoenix, they are piloting making changes, piloting getting data, making adjustments, and it's just getting better and better. So a lot of credit goes. The team is putting in a lot of work and they want to do it the right way. If this were about trying to make sure that we're at a certain enrollment level every quarter, then it would be a different story, but we're not doing that. We want the best outcomes and we want the transformation to go as soon as possible despite the near term consequences. And that's why we have to manage our costs. We have to give ourselves that runway so we can get through this. Trace Urdan Okay. Thanks, Greg. Gregory Cappelli Thanks so much, Trace. Operator Your last question comes from the line of Jeff Mueller [Robert W. Baird & Co.] Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jeff Mueller Yes, thank you. Can you just give us a refresher on the ownership of the voting shares? I think there was a Form 4 about a collateral call on some shares to fulfill a loan. But I don't recall if those are voting shares or not. So, any refresher you could give us on the voting stock ownership. Gregory Cappelli Jeff, I'm sorry, I don't have that information in front of me. I do recall obviously the filing there. And I don’t - I just don't have any further data. I think those were A shares, but I don't have that. I'm pretty sure they were, actually. But I can research that a little bit for you. But that was all disclosed in a prior filing. So… Jeff Mueller Okay. Gregory Cappelli I'm sure those were A shares. Jeff Mueller Okay. And then the $40 million minimum EBITDA target for Global in '17, is that inclusive or exclusive of the contribution from the German acquisition? Greg Iverson That is inclusive. So, now that we've included the partial year results for Career Partner, we're expecting EBITDA for '16 to be in excess of $40 million now for fiscal '16. Jeff Mueller Okay. And then can you give us a sense of the breadth of profitability in Global? You've done a few acquisitions of I guess, Germany and open colleges and that have been profitable, and then you're improving BPP. So, just any way you can frame up the breadth of the profitability. Is it concentrated in just a few institutions or is it pretty broad? Gregory Cappelli Well, I mean, it's a great question. We are looking at – I mean, profitability matters a lot to us in Global. There are some things, when we look at valuing the organization and creating long-term value, where local accounting revenue rack and things like that are different than we convert to in the US. So, we will follow that very clearly in the US. But that's why we look at EBITDA and cash, because that to us is the ultimate barometer for creating value. And I'll let Greg speak to that a little bit more. Greg Iverson Yes, first I want to just correct something I said to answer your last question. That $40 million of EBITDA obviously refers to fiscal '17, not to fiscal '16. But with regard to the composition of Apollo Global, so as we've said in the past, BPP is more than half of the revenue of Apollo Global. So it's clearly the largest institution. It's one of the institutions we've owned for the longest period of time. And so we are seeing some very significant - or starting to see some revenue growth there and also, importantly, some better leveraging of our fixed cost base. So we are seeing, as Greg mentioned, revenue gains in each of the different business units. But, to your point, just given BPP's size relative to the whole Apollo Global portfolio, we definitely see a disproportionate amount of our EBITDA, both this year and next year. Gregory Cappelli They've been through the transformation. The management has done an incredible job going through a very tough market there, sort of '09, '10, '11, taking the necessary steps, transforming, doing what they need to do, in a similar way to what's going on here to get improved relationships, outcomes, status. And it's working so their profitability has moved up nicely. They addressed the costs early on, which wasn't easy. I will say this too, Jeff, that when you look at certain institutions around the globe, some are making some meaningful investments. So if we're opening up a number of new locations in Mexico, right, that's going to have an impact or if we're investing in Brazil or in open colleges, that's going to have an impact. But we look at all that closely, we look at returns and incremental invested capital. We care very, very much about measuring the near term results, but also the long-term value that can be created. So that's how we assess the level of investment and the offset to profitability near term. Does that help? Jeff Mueller Okay. It does. And then just one more for me. On Global, I just want to make sure I have it right. I think that it was 20% organic constant currency growth last year. That's also the five-year long-term target. But you're saying dipping down maybe to the high teens this year. I know it's not a big change, but the only factors I heard were BPP timing and FX. So, is there anything worth calling out that's potentially driving a bit of deceleration in Global organic constant currency this year? Gregory Cappelli Not really. I mean, there's nothing that stands out. Whether its high teens or 20% it's going to be -call it 15% to 20%, it's going to be in a range, depending upon the timing and level of investments. But I don't see anything as I look across the organization to point to, other than the timing of things that Greg mentioned like the change in the number of times you can take exams and tests and things like that at BPP. If there is something that's more meaningful we'll call it out going forward. Jeff Mueller Fair enough. Thank you, guys. Gregory Cappelli Thanks so much. Operator As there are no further questions on the phone lines at this time, I would now turn the call back to Greg Cappelli. Gregory Cappelli All right. Thank you so much, everybody for listening this morning and for your understanding. And we'll look forward to following up and talking to you again soon. Take care.

Welcome to the ATI Technologies 2006 third quarter results conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the meeting over to Zev Korman, Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Zev Korman Thanks, Stephanie. Good morning everyone and welcome to ATI’s conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2006, ended May 31, 2006. Before I turn the call over to Dave Orton and Patrick Crowley, let me remind you that the discussions that follow contain forward-looking statements about ATI’s objectives, strategy and operating results.  These forward-looking statements, and in particular statements pertaining to our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, are based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may materially differ from our expectations, if known and unknown risks or uncertainties affect our business, or its estimates or assumptions proven accurate. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that forward-looking statements will materialize. Material assumptions that were applied to making these forward-looking statements and material factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are disclosed in today’s press release. Additional information concerning risks and uncertainties is contained in our filings with Canadian and US securities regulatory authorities, in particular in the risks and uncertainties section of our annual information form, and our annual MD&A for fiscal 2005. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or any other reason.  Also, let me remind you that we are reporting in US dollars and under Canadian GAAP. In order to ensure that everyone on the call that wishes to ask a question today has the opportunity to do so, we’re restricting the number of questions each caller may ask to one. At this time, I will turn the call over to Dave Orton. Dave Orton Good morning, and welcome to ATI’s Q3 fiscal 2006 conference call. Our focus in Q3 remains much the same as the priorities we defined three quarters ago as we entered fiscal 2006. These are:  In fiscal Q3, we continue to deliver on these five goals as ATI has delivered $652 million in sales, a 23% growth year-over-year. Our top of the line RADEON 1900 XTX took on all competitors and won, further strengthening our reign as king of the hill. We continue to innovate on multiple fronts as reflected by our team’s filing and being issued over 40 patents in Q3. In a seasonally slow quarter, we delivered record revenues and unit shipments for our handheld, DTV and chipset businesses while competing aggressively on our GPU segment with leadership products, and maintaining our number one market share position. We continue to invest in operational systems and translated this into improved business performance as we surpass 55 million units shipped in the quarter, and reduced our inventories by over $50 million. Patrick will elaborate on the financial and operational details later in the call.  Now, let’s recap Q3. I think the key highlight in our business is our consumer products. If you look at consumer plus our game console and royalties business, we hit an important milestone this quarter. We not only exceeded 100% growth year-over-year, and approached 50% gross margins in this business, but we also exceeded $150 million in revenues for the quarter; a run-rate of $600 million for the year.  On May 4, we announced a strategic relationship with Nokia, covering all areas of multi-media and 3D. Based on our partnership, ATI and Nokia are already working together to align roadmaps and deliver both a software architecture, innovative multimedia and 3D hardware solutions for the Nokia mobile phones.  Two days earlier the BitBoys acquisition was announced. This acquisition brings to ATI, OpenGL ES 2.0 and 3D graphic technologies and OpenVG 1.0 Vector Graphics Cores that enhance ATI’s product offerings. Additionally the BitBoys teams bring a very skilled R&D presence in Europe.  In Q3, we demonstrated our industry leading mobile DTV technologies. We are the only company offering a complete end-to-end mobile TV solution. We’re the only company at 3GSM delivering real world, live broadcast demos. Currently, in customer demonstrations in Europe, our WTD 100 is picking up crisp, clear images of the World Cup and is broadcasted by key systems.   Our DTV business set record revenue and unit shipments in Q3, now six sequential quarters of record revenue. On the strength of our Xilleon 240 processors, we expanded our position in nine of the top 11 LCD OEMs. Two key areas for innovating in DTVs are displaying superior image quality, and system on the chip integration, both areas where ATI is excelling in the very fast growing market.  HDTV sets containing ATI Xilleon chips continue to dominate image quality tests and product reviews. As an example, on a recent Sony Bravia review, which occurred in Business Week, the Bravia delivered beautiful, crisp, life-like high-definition images right out of the box. Our PC team demonstrated innovative leadership from day one of the quarter. We’ve launched the CrossFire Xpress 3200 chipset on March 1. This is the first chipset to offer unrestricted dual X 16 PCI express performance. We follow this by the first workstation graphics card with the 1 gigabyte frame buffer offering, our FireGL V7350. It was recently awarded a 4.5 out of five by the 3-D Professor, and editor’s recommendation for high end professional graphics. In the midst of all this, a check patch appeared and it immediately drew attention to the unbelievable jump in image quality obtained when running high dynamic range, also known as HDR, and ATI Xilleon together, a feat only possible on Radeon’s graphics processors and the  ATI GPU in the Xbox 360. Throughout the quarter, Intel used ATI’s GPUs to demonstrate Conroe, their next generation CPU that is expected to set the new gold standard for high performance processors. ATI was in every Intel Conroe system at WinHack, and in almost every system at Computex, because Intel knows that ATI GPUs provide the best gaming experience with Conroe.  One of the other technology highlights at this year’s COMDEX was our demonstration of a powerful gaming physics with the combination of CrossFire and Conroe. Writers endorsed our vision of balanced gaming. DX1900 XTX was launched January 24 and remains the undisputed king of the hill in single GPU performance. Others are now forced to double up processors for cards to attempt to grab the single slot title. The combined power of the CrossFire 3200 and dual 1900 are continuing to set new performance records and it’s led CrossFire and 1900 to design wins. Dell is now shipping the 1900 in their top of the line XPS, and Gateway was the first OEM to bring CrossFire to market. More will soon follow. Mobility Radeon maintained a strong hold in the notebook GPU market. Numerous design wins came through this quarter, including HP, Acer, Asus, Toshiba, Dell, Fujitsu Siemens, and this is just to name a few. CrossFire notebooks are just around the corner. Now I’ll turn the call over to Patrick, to review our Q3 financials. Patrick Crowley Thank you, Dave and good morning, everyone.  Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 were $652 million, and within the range of the guidance provided in our Q2 report. Q3 revenues represented a 3% sequential decline. Seasonality in the PC GPU segment was largely offset by growth in the ITP and consumer businesses. Considering that seasonal weakness in this year has been more pronounced than usual, we’re pleased with our financial performance in the quarter.  The broad based demand for our product in Q3 has also been reflected in our volumes, which hit a new quarterly unit record. In terms of revenue split, the PC segment represented $500 million or 77% of total revenue in the quarter. As a rough gauge, Desktop Discreet amounted to about 35% of total company revenues; chipsets increased to more than a quarter of revenues, and Notebook Discreet was around 15% of revenues. Revenue from Discreet products was down more than 10% sequentially, again reflecting the seasonality seen in the market and some added softness in the notebook market. Our chipset business enjoyed another strong quarter with record sales and unit demand. We continued to show positive margin improvement in the business. Sequential revenue growth was north of 5% on a combined basis, and margins improved to nearly 20%. The mix of chipsets was tilted slightly in favor of desktop.  The consumer segment, which includes handheld DTV, NRE and royalty revenues accounted for $132 million of revenue, or 23% of total company revenue in Q3. Consumer revenues were up more than 15% sequentially in what would also normally be considered a seasonally down quarter. It was another record quarter for handheld with shipments of about 25 million units and revenues up nearly 10% sequentially on continued penetration of the mainstream feature home market.  DTV had a fantastic quarter. Revenue in units were both up more than 50% sequentially. We’re seeing especially strong demand for the Xilleon 240 as Dave mentioned an integrated product and continued to land broad based new design wins, including wins with nine of the top 11 LCD TV OEMs.  Handheld and DTV accounted for more than 20% of company revenues. Royalties from our game console business, which includes royalties from both Microsoft and Nintendo, totaled approximately $10 million in the quarter. NRE was about $5 million in the quarter. Moving on to gross margins, consolidated gross margin percentage was 30.1% for the third quarter as compared with 28.2% last quarter, and in line with the guidance of 30%. Desktop Discreet margins improved substantially quarter-over-quarter, but were not in the PC gross margin model in Q3. Corporate gross margin also benefited from continued improvement in our chipset gross margins, which I said were nearly 20%. The strong consumer margin percentage overall remains steady. Operating expenses were $153 million, which was up 10% sequentially and a bit below guidance due to some higher than anticipated investment tax credits. As a percentage of sales, R&D and SG&A were also in line with our model targets of 13% to 15% and 8% to 10%, respectively. GAAP net income for the quarter was $31.9 million or $0.12 per share diluted. Adjusted net income, which excludes stock option expense, amortization of intangibles, and other charges was $42.5 million or $0.16 per share diluted. Stock-based compensation in the quarter was $12.9 million.  The effective tax rate was 8% this quarter. That’s due to a one-time adjustment, which is not expected to recur. There is no change in our expected average tax rate of about 18% on a forward-looking basis.  Moving now to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with inventory of $366 million or about 79 days based on Q3 revenues. We committed last quarter to bring our inventory down below $400 million, and we did. We continue to work to further improve our inventory management processes.  Our financial position remains strong with cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end of $518 million. The key drivers for the sequential decline in cash were: a reduction in payables and accruals; the repurchase of about 1.5 million shares under the normal course issuer bid for a total of $24.7 million; and $37.2 million on the acquisitions of XGI and BitBoys. We’re certainly very pleased with the progress of those two transactions. As Dave mentioned earlier, Q3 was a tough quarter for the industry, and we feel that the macro market is in a temporary lull before growth resumes later in the calendar year. Nonetheless, we see some near-term uncertainty and weakness in that macro market, which is reflected in our guidance.  For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be between $620 million and $660 million. We still expect to expand gross margins, and should see gross margins percentage in 31% to 31.5% range in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses, excluding stock option expense, amortization and other charges, but including the impact of foreign exchange, are expected to be between $155 million and $160 million.  You should also be aware in calculating adjusted earnings per share; you should factor in an additional $3 million for RSU expense per quarter, based on the RSUs that were issued during our Q3 just completed.  We see a number of catalysts on the horizon that should result in a strong second half of the calendar year. With a number of new processors, platforms and transitions on the way, there is some near-term customer uncertainty, but these will actually help to drive the industry forward later this year. In the meantime, we remain very confident in the trajectory of our business and committed to the goals we set with respect to margin expansion, operational improvement, and inventory and expense management.  Now, I’ll hand the mike back to Dave for a look ahead. Dave Orton Thanks, Patrick. I appreciate that. For this quarter, we remain committed to the five priorities outlined earlier and that Patrick just described. First, a tight expense management, continuing to scrutinize and control expenses; improve our operational business systems to support our scale and improve our predictability will continue to be a key focus of business, as well as continuing to focus on inventory management.  Margin expansion is paramount and continues to be a top priority for the Company. We expect margin percentage to improve in Q4, and again over the fall quarter. We have aligned the entire company around this platform.  We continue to focus on building design win momentum to accelerate the growth in our consumer business. Demand for LCD DTVs in very strong, particularly in Europe right now, and we expect Xilleon to set a new revenue and unit shipment record in Q4. Our next generation Xilleon is ramping with designs hitting the shelves this fall. This new Xilleon will redefine image quality benchmarks and deliver features reserved in the past for separate, specialized chips. Image quality is such a critical criteria now for digital TVs that OEMs are now asking to use the ATI logo on upcoming designs as a competitive differentiator.  Momentum continues to build for the multimedia handsets as well, and users are now clamoring for higher resolution cameras, video recording, CD quality mp3 playback, and soon, digital TV. ATI’s Imageon 2282 is the media co-processor of choice for devices in the second half of 2006.  Motorola, LG, Panasonic, and HTC will soon introduce Imageon 2282-based multimedia phones. Panasonic and HTC will utilize 2282 in their next generation 3D platforms, and will be available worldwide. Our relationship with Qualcomm continues to grow. The MSN 7500, Qualcomm’s first chip to utilize our Imageon technology, is now in designs with a number of Qualcomm customers, and volume is expected to start in calendar Q4. Qualcomm remains a very strategic customer and partner as we look forward to continuing to expand business opportunities with them.  Then, number one, growing our PC business through product leadership and innovative platform technology advances. We will launch new Radeon products in the second half of 2006 and reinforce our commitment to single GPU leadership. In Q4, the powerful combination of CrossFire, the 1900, and Intel’s Conroe will set new standards for gaming performance.  On June 18, enthusiasts cited NordicHardware covered Overclockers as they set new benchmark records on the 3Dmark 06, 3Dmark 05, and 3Dmark 01 SE, all utilizing the power of Conroe, CrossFire and 1900. Historically, when Intel launches the next generation products, PC demand is increased, but Conroe will do more. It will drive strong GPU sales through higher end platform sales, and through the combination of Conroe and CrossFire.  Finally as we enter the second half of calendar 2006, both IDT and Gartner have upwardly revised their second half PC shipment forecast, citing improvements in the market. Though our guidance remains a bit cautious, we are at the same time optimistic as Intel moves forward to Conroe, AMD moves to AM2 Socket. The market prepares for HD DVDs and Blue Rays on PCs, and then Vista Ready graphics and video solutions are being launched by ATI this fall. With the many technology advances about to hit the market, ATI is primed for yet another period of accelerated growth.  At this point, we are ready to take your questions; and remember, please, one question each. Thanks. Question-and-Answer-Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Ed Pang - Credit Suisse.   Ed Pang - Credit Suisse  Yes, good morning, thank you. Dave, I think it’s not much of a surprise that the PC market is weak. You also talked about some near-term market uncertainties due to macro trends.  I was wondering if you had any visibility beyond the August quarter, or really what you are seeing from customers that gives you the confidence that we’re going to see a pretty good rebound in the second half on PCs. Dave Orton  I think as we all see March, April, May and even June have been slow in the market, and to some extent some of that is I think a pent-up waiting for these platform transitions that are coming.  When we work with our customers, there is a lot of excitement around back-to-school, and that really starts to pop in the middle of July and drive through September. In Europe they call it the University and then holidays, so they actually have three bumps, but we think of it generally as the fall and holiday cycle.  I think that the combination of the new technologies and some of the macro -- not that there have been extra macroeconomic challenges, but the pause that I think the industry is seeing. The beliefs there from the OEMs and actually from the end customers in many cases, the retailers, are that the back half should be quite a bit stronger.  Ultimately it is going to have to result in uptakes in system demands. But the initial views, the initial forecast and geographic excitement seems to be there.  Ed Pang - Credit Suisse   Can I just have one clarification please?   Dave Orton  Sure.  Ed Pang - Credit Suisse   I think in the press release you mentioned that Desktop Discreet gross margins were down?    Dave Orton Year-over-year, yes, not quarter-over-quarter. Sequentially they improved significantly, Desktop GPU margins, but year-over-year they were down slightly. In the press release we have to pick up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Operator Our next question comes from Rick Schafer - CIBC World Markets. Dan Gillies  - CIBC World Markets  This is actually Dan Gillies calling in for Rick. Just looking at  the margin improvement you've had, you mentioned it came from chipsets and Notebook Discreet this time. Looking forward next quarter, could you talk a little bit about what is driving the margin improvement there?   Dave Orton If you look at what Patrick described, there is a slight improvement in revenues on our consumer business. The notebook market right now looks just a little softer than what we would have projected say six months ago, moving through the summer. The desktop we expect to be pretty flat as we move into Q4.  So first you want to get the product mix right. But on the chipset business, we do expect a little stronger mix in desktop than in notebook on the chipsets, and that will actually, that is a margin negative for the Company. But the overall product margins across the board will improve in Q4.  So if you look at any particular segment: desktop integrated, notebook integrated, desktop GPU's,  we expect all the PC gross margins by product to improve in Q4. We expect consumer to be basically the same, about flat quarter-over-quarter. So the blend of all that, the combination of that with product mix is where it would drive now that 1 to 1.5 point improvement projected in Q4. Operator Our next question comes from Shawn Webster, JP Morgan. Shawn Webster - JP Morgan Good morning. Thank you. Can you give some more clarity on the order trends that you experienced in the May quarter and some commentary on your bookings linearity? What did your orders do quarter-over-quarter? Could you give us an update on the composition of your inventory? Thanks.   Dave Orton Wow. Patrick Crowley Why don't I talk about the inventory? I think when we look at the inventory -- and we made a conscious decision, Shawn, to drop our inventory -- and we did that in two ways to not only continue to meet our sales target range, but also to cut back on the amount of raw materials that we were bringing in.  So what you will see when we talked last quarter about the inventory, we said that there were a couple of things that were driving that up. One was substrates. Substrates are well down from what we saw last quarter. The second thing that we had was a lot of North bridges on chipsets but no South bridges to match up to them, and that created a bulge. That is now gone.  The third component of that was some of the ATP inventory and that has moved as well. So I think our inventories are in reasonably good shape, but I think we still have a way to go to reach our overall target.   Dave Orton Then the question on bookings throughout the quarter, it is amazing because our business is so OEM centric, the actual billings are very linear. From a bookings standpoint we actually did see some softening in bookings as you moved through the quarter. So I think the OEM part of the business started to pull back a little bit, and the caution around April, May and June.  We started to see some improvement in June, but again, I think what we are cautious about is the ramp as we move back into the back-to-school market on the OEM side. Again, a big part of our business is OEM driven. So it is really looking at the OEMs and the end OEM channel and when that starts to pick up. But we are bullish, but cautious right now particularly over the first month-and-a-half of this quarter. Operator Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs. Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs  Thanks very much. Looking at your August quarter guidance can you maybe just outline some of the assumptions behind that in addition to the macro market as far as maybe your market share and  ASPs? Also, what would be the typical linearity of the August quarter as far as how back-end loaded should we expect it to be?   Dave Orton  Again, because our business is primarily OEM driven ASPs would typically be fairly consistent if you look across handheld DTV. The only area really where you see some movement would be the desktop channel. I think as Patrick described, ASPs in Q3 were down slightly. We had a good unit quarter, a little stronger mix in the low end in our Q3. So we would expect ASPs to pick up some in our Q4 from a desktop channel standpoint. Across the rest of the business fairly similar, we will see a slight decline in ASPs and chipsets as we move from a notebook to a desktop mix as well. But I think other than that ASPs will hold pretty steady.  In terms of linearity again, we do expect just typical linearity in these quarters are that June is the softest of the three months, and then it continues to build through July and August. Operator Our next question comes from Devan Moodley - Scotia Capital. Devan Moodley  - Scotia Capital  I just want to follow-up on Simona's question and get you to give us some sense of direction with respect to your guidance for PC versus consumer. Can you just split your assumptions up between PC and consumer? What do you expect for the consumer business?   Dave Orton Yes, we can. No problem. We would expect consumer to have a slight improvement in Q4 over Q3. There have been some changes in some of our customer forecasting processes, and that caused a little bit of a pullback.  We actually are not out looking, but we are optimistic that that will shift back to a normal course of business. But it's actually more of a process change than anything. Then on the PC side we would expect, as we described in Q3, our chipset business will go down in Q4. Some of that was as Patrick described, we had this bubble coming into Q3 of North bridges. We had a fab excursion back in December/January. That created a wave of South bridges to line up with our North bridges in our fiscal Q3.  We lose that bubble in Q4 so we actually are a little tighter particularly in the front half of the quarter on capacity, but we expect capacity completely cleared up as we enter our August month. So chipsets will be down. We also expect -- and this is not news to us -- in working with Intel over the last year they described that as Conroe comes to market, the 965 will come to market, that will take some of the mid, higher end part of our desktop chipset business and drive our desktop down a little bit, both in units and lower ASPs. So that has been planned for in our chipset business. Then GPUs, flat, this is the cautious area. We could be more bullish and it's just really a question of the macro market. The pick-up of the system SI  and the sell through of that will really drive any potential upside in the quarter on our desktop channel. Operator Our next question comes from Chris Caso - Friedman Billings Ramsey. Chris Caso  - Friedman Billings Ramsey  I wondered if you could clarify something you said earlier and maybe give a little more color on the consumer part of the business. You talked about some changes in customer forecast, does that refer to the handset business or the digital TV business or maybe a bit of both?  Just give some more granularity as to what you're seeing in that business. I think typically your August quarter is typically quite strong in consumer from past quarters.   Dave Orton  Yes, we actually see consumer pick up in late April, so May is also very strong. It is really kind of a combination of OEM and ODM process changes that we are working on and just our hubbing model.  So it is across the board in the handheld and one or two customers in the DTV space. So in those changes, the combination of that, we pulled back a little bit. And it's probably a balancing of inventory in the supply chain as much as anything, so we pulled back a little bit so that is why we are a little more cautious on consumer this quarter than I think what you would see historically. Operator Our next question comes from Padma Yanamandra -Deutsche Bank.  Padma Yanamandra -Deutsche Bank   It seems like SLI still has virtually the whole multi GPU market. Can you guys talk about what breaks that stranglehold and give us a feel for the traction you're getting with CrossFire 3200? In the past you've mentioned a 40% market share target; can you give us a timeline on that and talk about the progress you're making on it?   Dave Orton I think if you happened to attend Computex, that would be a kind of a revelation on the acceptance of CrossFire across the ODM part of the market. What is driving it really is Conroe. Conroe brings out, and we bring out the best in Conroe really for the gamer market, so the combination of Conroe and CrossFire 3200 was demonstrated very broadly at Computex. We continue to market that very effectively as we prepare for the launch of Conroe this summer. In addition, we demonstrated at Computex a new technology. Now it is really from a volume standpoint we say it its maybe nine to 12 months out, but conceptually you can see what physics and gaming can do together. CrossFire provides the capability to leverage a second GPU in the system to really fully enable the capabilities behind real physics and gaming.  Throughout the summer you're going to see more and more SIs bring to market CrossFire solutions, based on ATI chipsets as well as based on Intel chipsets with Conroe, the 975. So it will be driven by both of those.  I would just say continue to monitor large gamer SI sites and we will update you in the fall. Operator Our next question comes from Andrew Lee - TD Newcrest. Andrew Lee  - TD Newcrest   Does the Q4 guidance factor in your Discreet business reaching the target model of 32 to 35? If not, what is holding that back considering you have refreshed your product line?   Dave Orton  The answer is no, it has us improving gross margins in our desktop GPU business, but it does not reach the model in Q4. That is driven by a few things. There continues to be some inventory that will be selling out -- very limited, but still some inventory -- that I would say we are selling out with net realizable values that are fairly low margins. So there is some overhang on that. I think in combination with that as the market is aware, in the performance segment of the market we have been late with some of our new products. Those are going to come later in the summer. So we've been filling that segment of the market with products that obviously will be at lower gross margin as well. So I think the combination of those are driving the margins down somewhat. Very good yields on 90 nanometer, initial yields very successful on 80 as well. We continue to see progress on our desktop GPUs, and I think as we enter fiscal '07, you will see us start to approach the margin model for desktop GPUs. Operator Our next question comes from Paul Howbold - Desjardins Securities. Paul Howbold  - Desjardins Securities   Just a clarification. Did you say the handheld business for the third quarter was up 10% sequentially in revenues or units, and DTV 50%? What also was the split between the two of those?   Dave Orton  The split in general is, I think of it still as about two-thirds one-third. Sequentially DTV did grow about 50% quarter-over-quarter, Q2 to Q3. Handset was up about 10%, Q3 from Q2. That was revenues, not units. Paul Howbold  - Desjardins Securities   That's revenues. And has there been any change with the ASP?   Dave Orton  In terms of ASPs, no not significant changes in ASPs in Q3 over Q2. Operator Our next question comes from David Hodgson - Genuity Capital Markets.  David Hodgson  - Genuity Capital Markets  Thank you.  Just getting back a little bit to gross margin, I am still trying to gauge it. Your consumer businesses is in the high 40s, your chipset business is approaching 20% I guess that infers that GPU -- my math has it between 27% to 28%.  You have said that you worked through most of the legacy inventory. Can I infer here that you are way below where your competitor is, and yet you talk about the strength of your product stack.  Is it the case that you're not refreshing your product stack until the fall and therefore you're having to sharpen your pencil on the pricing on a number of individual sub-segments of Desktop Discreet in order to move product? Just trying to rationalize why you are still at just 27% to 28%. Thanks.   Dave Orton  I think first you have to look at mix, Dave, and again, we have a significant OEM mix and a significant Notebook Discreet mix in our product line. OEM as I think everybody is aware, has a lower gross margins in general than the channel. You've got to get down into the mix of the product lines I think to some extent.  The other is as Patrick described, we did move a significant amount of AGP business, but in general our AG product line today, its got to hit a price point in the market -- and the market is still there -- but it is margins, and we continue to drive product into the AGP segment, and it continues to be low ASPs.  The channel itself, we are just cautious about the pickup of the channel. It was a slow calendar Q2 in the channel; the more the channel picks up the more upside there is for margins on our desktop GPU business.  The blend, remember, has notebook desktops in there as well. I hope that helps answer that, if not I think our team probably has a call with you later today as well. We can help straighten that out. Operator Our next question comes from Deepak Chopra - National Bank Financial. Deepak Chopra  - National Bank Financial   Just follow on the same lines in terms of gross margins. For the Q4 where are you thinking integrated is going to go? Are we going to move to north of 20% and at what point do you think we will hit the 25% to 30% range we've talked about previously?   Dave Orton  Part of the discussion with David just now, Deepak, the mix, the product margins are improving across the board. We had mix working against us in Q4 so we're going to see a stronger desktop mix.  As I talked about earlier as the 965, the 975 come in, our Intel desktop business will actually drop a bit in ASPs. So we're going to see more of a desktop mix in Q4 and probably a little bit of an ASP decline in Q4 on the chipset side.  So overall blended chipset margins might actually go down slightly because of product mix. But still around 20%, so we approached 20% in Q3. I think we're going to still be approaching 20% in Q4 because of mix. But on an individual product basis margins are improving. So that is driving some of that. In terms of we are just rolling out our new South bridge; we talked about this SB600. That is coming to market. That is ramping quite well. I don't expect margin improvements from that until the fall quarter, because we really need to ramp that.  Then the second phase that really brings the margins to 25% and then as we move through the year we want to be obviously approaching 30%. We have strength of our products as we move to 90 nanometer and actually 80 nanometer and those are doing phenomenally well in the lab right now.  The bringing up of those, so I would say stay tuned to us as we move throughout the summer and we start talking more about our next generation North Bridges in 80 nanometer. But they will not be in the market in our fiscal Q4. They will be late fall, and then we will see some continued improvement there as well. So I hope that helps. Operator Our next question comes from Bruce Krugel - Blackmont Capital. Bruce Krugel  - Blackmont Capital  Dave, you've spoken about your ASPs with regard to Intel. Would you mind going into more detail, what your strategy is with the Intel rollout of their Conroe processors please?   Dave Orton Well, the strategy is obviously multi-fold. Teaming up with Intel to bring Conroe to market on the gamer side with CrossFire is a key part of the strategy, and really addressing the gamer market more broadly and showing what is possible with new levels of performance.  As you move into the channel, the bulk of our chipset business -- I am trying to think here -- probably most of the Intel chipset business will not be based on Conroe. The Conroe systems will be on 975, 965 primarily and our chipsets will be down in desktops and notebooks. As they move that down market over time we expect to be picking up some Conroe business, but most of it is down in the value segment of the market. We've been working with Intel for the last several months on the right positioning of our chipset to support the broad platform. On the notebook side we are encouraged about the breadth of design wins and the ramps, we have ramps this fall on both desktop and notebook. They don't start ramping really until late August or September, some new design wins that really will be significant volume for us, but that will be in the fall quarter. I think that is the bulk of it.  There is obviously a range of marketing and channel programs both that ATI is doing and ATI and Intel are doing around the launch of Conroe. Operator  Our next question comes from Arnab Chanda - Lehman Brothers. Kenneth Hui  - Lehman Brothers   This is Kenneth Hui for Arnab. I just had a question if you guys could qualitatively talk about your handset business in terms of the strength or weakness you're seeing going into the second half and if that has changed in the last two quarters?   Dave Orton It's a good question. I think as we moved through the spring and summer at a macro market level, there are push and pulls. There is this drive to a billion units in the market and I think an opportunity to achieve a billion units or approach a billion units in the calendar year.  Motorola continues to do very well. We have other customers whether it is Panasonic or HTC that I think are having very strong business. So I would say it is pretty much as expected, maybe we are being a little more cautious as we move through the summer, but we are excited about the new platforms coming to market.  I think you will see how handset business ASPs start to actually increase over the next six months as well with some of our new platforms, higher end platforms coming to market. Operator Our next question comes from Dennis Fong - MGI Securities. Dennis Fong  - MGI Securities I was wondering if you could comment on your views of the industry in terms of price competition on the microprocessor side, is that in fact based on the graphics side at all?   Dave Orton  Good question; we were actually discussing that with somebody yesterday as well. It's not so much that it ripples back to price declines on our side of the business for us and then NVIDIA for example, but it does affect mix. Part of this, we will push to a lower end part of our product line. So we do expect mix shifts to occur as I think both Intel and AMD are trying to fuel some excitement in the market through price moves in front of the new processors coming to market.  We clearly see that, some move down market. Even the AGC I'm amazed that some of the sustained volume on the AGC part of the market, driven both by processor pricing and chipsets still in the market there. That does have some negative impact on both mix from a margin standpoint for ATI as well. Operator Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton - Needham. Quinn Bolton  - Needham  Just a quick clarification. I just wanted to make sure I heard you right on the new chipset platforms, you're targeting end of the year introduction on the 80 and 90 nanometer.  For those products you said that you're seeing pretty good results in the lab. Were you talking more performance or were you talking more about hitting that mid 20% to even 30% gross margin targets on those new North bridges?   Dave Orton  In our chipset performance, you don't over clock chipsets, so it's not performance per se. It was from the time you receive the blind build silicon from our partner, you plug it in the board and you have graphics running. Typically we think of days -- this was hours. So the phenomenal excitement in terms of how quickly these 80 nanometer parts came up.  So I think it is excitement around the quality of the process; any time you bring a new process up you are cautious about particularly the analog part of the design.  The second are the yields, excitement about the yields on these initial runs.  So I think the combination ultimately that will lead to lower costs. So our ability to get to market fast and the ability to deliver lower-cost solutions to the market is what really is driving the excitement in the hallways of ATI around our chipset business right now. Operator Our next question comes from  David Wu - Global Crown Capital. David Wu  - Global Crown Capital  I have a question and a clarification. The clarification is, Dave, the July 23, 24 price cut by Intel and AMD respectively for desktop, would that cause a pent-up demand in the month of August? If there is upside to the Discreet business, actually are you ready to fill it and make up the August quarter maybe much more of a hockey stick quarter than you normally would get this year?  The other thing I was wondering is in your breakout on your consumer side, the operating margin dropped from the previous quarter into Q3 and not a huge drop, but nonetheless a drop. Should I infer from that that in fact that you're DTV business at the operating margin level is lower than what it is for your cell phone business?   Dave Orton Could you repeat the beginning part of the second question?  So the first question I understand on the desktop and the market there with the pricing; the second question again? David Wu  - Global Crown Capital   In your segment breakdown you breakdown consumer, and if I look at your quarter-to-quarter comparison it appears that it declined, and the only thing I heard was that digital television is a bigger piece this quarter than the last quarter.  I was wondering since digital television typically gives you better gross margin, it must be at a lower operating margin structure than your cell phone co-process business.   Dave Orton So let me answer both of those, and then Patrick can help fill in some of the gaps. So first in the market with regard to the August quarter, obviously operationally we build pretty linear. We want to keep the factories and the packaging houses moving, and support any kind of ramp. It’s not just the August month, but it is August, September and October are very big months in the industry so we want to be in front of that, so we do want to be ready for upside.  The challenge always is predicting the right mix, but again with the strength of the OEM business you have visibility into that ahead of the channel business from a mix standpoint. You asked about given the price drops there do we expect this to spawn some demand? We think so. In general there's some elasticity and pricing in the PC business. I honestly believe more of the elasticity is driven around new technologies, new excitement of products that come to market. What we bring to market this fall with graphics, what Conroe does in the market, as AMD drives new technologies into the notebook segment as well.  Now on the consumer business I'm going to turn it over to Patrick. Patrick Crowley  I think what has happened is that if you look at the overall consumer business, both handheld DTV, nothing has changed significantly there at all. I think what we end up with is just a touch lower in royalties in NRE that might impact the overall percentage and perhaps the OpEx might change that somewhat as well.   Dave Orton We are taking an OpEx hit with the acquisitions, now it wasn't across much of the quarter, but we did have acquisitions. Patrick Crowley That is an operating margin there.   Dave Orton  Yes. So it was really more on the expense side. Margins were slightly up in Q3 from Q2. So from a margin percentage standpoint, that improved. You are right, the product part of the consumer business actually would have seen a margin improvement quarter-over-quarter, but we've had an operation expense hit. That is primarily where we are making our investments today is quite a bit of focus on our consumer business. I hope that helps, David. Operator Our next question comes from Tayyib Shah - Longbow Research. Tayyib Shah  - Longbow Research  Assuming that chipset prices were under pressure in the March timeframe, and there was some dumping of low end chipsets in the market as well. Can you talk about how that affects your ability to maintain chipset margins around 20% in fiscal fourth quarter?  If you can provide some color on how your chipset businesses is between low end chipsets and mid to high-end products?   Dave Orton  First in terms of the chipset dumping in calendar Q2, again most of our business -- probably 90 some odd percent of our chipset business is OEM based. So the OEMs in general don't see some of what I will call the channel dynamics that go on in terms of the pricing and some of the motherboard activities going on in the distribution channel.  So we were somewhat transparent to that. We did expect and do continue to expect to see more channel business in our Q4, a slight step up as we improve capacity with the SB600. We are seeing OEM mix shift from notebook to desktop, a little more of a pop over there, and the OEMs that are coming to market with our products some of the mix in ASPs with those OEMs because of the SKUs they are using, are lower ASP SKUs.  But in general the pricing is fairly stable in the OEM business. It is really on OEM design cycles that you go to battle to win the designs. But once you ramp, you have a fairly predictable decline in pricing, it is a schedule that you work with the OEMs on. So I don't think that is a problem.  The challenge obviously for us is that as Intel brings to market Conroe and the 965 comes to market, we are positioned a little lower segment of the market on our Intel platform chipset business. That will have an impact on ASPs and margins, but we do expect Q4 margins to still be around 20%. Operator Our next question comes from Krishna Shankar - JMP Securities. Krishna Shankar  - JMP Securities  You mentioned that the mix shift in Discreet graphics moved towards the lower end. Can you give us a sense for the X1900 SE, how quickly that could ramp up and your efforts to move into the higher margins Discreet graphics space? Also an update on upcoming products that is hopefully coming upstream.   Dave Orton  In terms of calendar Q2, the North American business was pretty reasonable. Europe was geographically was slower. It is typically a slow quarter for them, and it started a little sooner this year. It started in April instead of May, so I think that is what has had some of the impact on the business. The emerging markets, as they come to market it is generally a lower mix. So as we bring on Brazil, India, China, Russia you do see a lower mix of products in those new geographies, and that is just going to have an overall shift in the market there. We are planning a refresh of our product line as I mentioned in my prepared presentation as we move into the late summer and fall; and we are actually quite excited about that. So I think the combination of the seasons, the geographic mix shifts and the new platforms that will come to market will see a general higher mix of products as we move through Q4 and into our Q1, but I still expect the front half of our Q4 to be more low end. Operator Our next question comes from Satya Chillara - American Technology Research. Satya Chillara  - American Technology Research  \\ Good morning. Dave, I just wanted to drill down a little more on the cell phone comments you made. You talked about some inventory adjustments during the quarter. Is this more of a demand issue at this point or how do you see this and how long is this going to continue?   Dave Orton  We are actually quite bullish on the end demand. Its really more of a balancing as I mentioned and it probably wasn't warranted. It's just that we are seeing a little bit of supply chain redefinition in a couple parts of our business and its not unique to any one customer or one segment. It happens quite often in the PC business; it is just that its so large and we're not quite as large a player.  In  the handset market we got a very high percentage of customer base and market share percentage there. So I think it is just a general supply chain adjustment that is going on. But in terms of general demand in the market, no we aren't seeing a slowdown there at all. And in some of the chip platform traditions, one of the things we are seeing right in front of us is we do have new platforms coming to market this fall; that creates a transition in effect as you drain down supply of the product of the older platform, you ramp the new one. The ramps of the ones aren't coming quite as fast as maybe we had predicted in the spring, so all that does is it causes a supply chain adjustment to occur.  I think we are phenomenally excited about what is going on in the handset business and we continue to expect to see growth in '07 like we have in '06. Operator Our next question comes from  Sidney Ho - Merrill Lynch. Sidney Ho  - Merrill Lynch  Thanks.  Most of my questions have been answered but I have one more related to Desktop Discreet business. You guys have done a good job on the R580. Macro factors aside, which market segment or channel do you think you have the best opportunity or would you like to see market share gain over the next quarter or two? Do you think you will need to wait until the R600 class product to see the share gain?   Dave Orton If you think about the desktop market, and people have debates over whether it is three, four, five or ten segments, but if I think about it as five segments, and five let's say is the top segment -- some of the segment 4 and some of segment 3 I would say are weaker segments. Segment 1 and 2 are strong and segment 5 are strong.  So that classic $150 to $250 segment of what I would call board price in the market, I talked about some delays in new product that we have coming later in the summer. So we actually expect to have a very strong fall quarter in our GPU business all in front of the R600. We have a new class of products coming to market in the fall in front of the R600 family of products. We are quite bullish about that. In combination of that is on the high-end I think there is still an opportunity -- somebody mentioned earlier with CrossFire -- they asked about our penetration there and we are; we are counting on Conroe. We are excited about that and that's going to drive our high-end part of our business stronger than what you call the R580 or 1900 XGX class of product.  So there is more room and opportunity for us there as well, but that $150 to $250 segment is probably the weakest of our stack. I'd hate to use the word weakness, too, by the way. Operator Our next question comes from  Dayle Hogg - GMP Securities. Dayle Hogg  - GMP Securities   I was wondering if you could talk about your mix between the channel and the OEMs. Compared with NVIDIA, your margin have been weak largely due to that, how do you see that evolving? How do you really address the channel market better than you have to-date?   Dave Orton  Our mix today is 60/40, 65/35, somewhere there, channel versus OEM, but channel also includes retail in that number. So that is retail SI and then broad, what we call inboard channel. So probably in the last quarter maybe it was closer to 60/40 mix range.  I think the opportunity is that if you look at the macro market we would say that the channel is probably two-thirds of the business and OEM is one-third. So there is a big greenfield there of opportunity in the channel. I think as we discussed earlier there is a combination of things that we need to do. We actually have a very active program going on right now, and we launched in Europe late in May, we again reinforced that at Computex, and it is totally linked programs.  Think about the end customer demand, defining the segments and driving end customer demand and then putting channel programs together all the way through the entire channel chain to drive that. In combination with that back-to-school has been a big focus for us, not just with the OEMs but with what I will call the large SI's, medium SI's in aligning our product lines to attack aggressively the back-to-school and the holiday season. So it is pricing, it's programs, it's the classic four P's of marketing. Good products, and we have the products lined up and the stack lined up to do that; and then, we are tying the other 3 P's together with that.  So I think the team and the customers are quite excited. We walked away from Computex and our partners were very excited about the program. It is just that right now it is a little slow in the market so we are counting on that to pop back as we move through July and August. Operator There are no further questions registered at this time. I would like to turn the meeting back over to you, Mr. Orton.   Dave Orton  Thank you very much, and thank you everybody for your questions today. I appreciate your time as well. I want to personally thank everybody at ATI for their efforts in delivering a successful quarter in what was really a seasonally slow quarter for the industry. We have set ourselves up well – big thanks to our team --for the second half of calendar 2006. I also want to thank our customers and partners for your continued support. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we report our fourth-quarter results early in the fall. Thank you very much, and have a good day. Operator Thank you. The conference has now ended.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over the Hock Tan. Hock? Hock Tan Thank you, Ashish. Good afternoon everyone. Well, we delivered strong financial results for the first quarter with revenue of $41.5 billion and gross margin at 62.4%, both at a very top end of our guidance. Earnings per share of $3.63 grew by 5% sequentially, while net revenue was essentially flat. Revenue was better than expected in all four segments. The benefits we achieved through business diversification clearly came through this quarter with growth in Wired, Enterprise Storage, and Industrial completely offsetting the typical negative seasonality from Wireless. The integration of classic Broadcom has gone very well and is now mostly complete. We remain focused on driving financial performance towards our long-term operating margin and free cash flow targets. Let me now turn to a discussion of our segment results, starting with Wired, our largest segment. In the first quarter, Wired revenue came in at $2.09 billion better than expected and represented 50% of our total revenue. Revenue for this segment was up slightly on a sequential basis, benefited from strong demand for Ethernet Switching and Routing products from cloud data center operators. This growth was partially offset by the continuing seasonal decline in demand for our broadband carrier access and set-top box products, which we expect to bottom in this first quarter. Turning to the second fiscal quarter, we forecast Wired revenue experience sequential growth a little bit stronger than what we saw in the prior quarter. We expect the momentum from cloud data center demand to sustain and expect a seasonal increase in demand for our broadband access and set-top box products. Now moving on to Wireless. In the first quarter, Wireless revenue came in at about $1.18 billion, better than expect and Wireless segment represented 28% of our total revenues. Revenue for this core segment was down 13% sequentially, driven by the expected seasonal decline in demand from a major North American customer. Turning now to our projection for the second quarter fiscal of 2017, we expect to hit the bottom of annual product cycle transition at a major North American customer. However, we expect to offset a significant portion of this decline in Wireless from a ramp of the next generation phone as our large Korean smartphone customer. This phone comes with an increase in Broadcom's RF and Wi-Fi connectivity content. As a result, we expect our Wireless revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to be still sequentially down, but in the high single-digits better than the more typical double-digit declines we have experienced in prior years. Let me now turn to Enterprise Storage, which continues to be strong. In the first quarter, Enterprise Storage revenue came in at $707 million and this segment represented 17% of our total revenue. Segment revenue grew 26% sequentially, gaining better than expected driven by stronger shipments of SAS, RAID, and Fiber Channel products. As we foresaw, our hard disk drive and custom solid state drives controllers also had a very strong quarter. And looking into the second quarter, however, we believe this resurgence of Enterprise Storage has to taper off and hence flatten out. Having said that, backlog for Enterprise Storage products continues up to today to be very strong. But we foresaw what we foresee seasonality to start slowing demand in the third quarter if not in this -- late in the second quarter. Finally, turning to our last segment, Industrial. In the first quarter, Industrial revenue grew -- came in at $180 million, up 11% sequentially better than expected as we rebuild depleted channel inventory consistent with stronger product resales. The industrial segment represented 5% of our total revenue and as we look into the second quarter, we are anticipating industrial activity to continue to improve seasonally and accordingly, we are expecting industrial segment revenue to increase by high single-digits sequentially. With all that to sump-up -- to simply sum-up, this second quarter was strong, revenue flat from the seasonally high fourth quarter of the preceding year. As we know look into the second quarter, we expect this demand environment for our products to continue to be very healthy and our outlook for this quarter's revenue to be virtually flat to that of the prior quarter. It is becoming evident that our broader and more diversified product portfolio has largely mitigated seasonal impacts to consolidated revenue during the first half of the year. This is certainly an intrinsic goal of our business model just that we did not expect to achieve these so soon. The integration of classic Broadcom is clearly going well and we continue to invest across all our franchise products. We are sustaining our technology leadership and our products are very well received by our customers. Our revenue trajectory from the first half of fiscal 2017 could possibly extend into the second half. Nonetheless, we do not expect that the approximate 15% level of year-on-year growth we are guiding for the second quarter to really be sustainable in the long-term. Our long-term operating model will continue to assume mid-single-digit annual revenue growth for the consolidated business. With that let me now turn the call over to Tom for detailed review our first quarter fiscal 2017 financials. Tom Krause Thank you, Hock, good afternoon everyone. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today that is available on our website at Broadcom.com. Let me first start out by saying that we are very pleased with the execution this quarter and specifically the progress we've made towards our long-term target model, which remains an operating margin target of 45% of net revenue and a free cash flow margin above 35% of net revenue. Further to what Hock was saying, we also believe that we can achieve these long-term operating targets based on a sustainable long-term revenue growth rate of mid-single-digits. Now, let me review the Q1 results. Revenue for the quarter came in at $4.15 billion, approximately flat sequentially. Foxconn was greater than 10% direct customer in the first fiscal quarter. Our first quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 62.4%, about 90 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, primarily due to revenue at the top end of guidance and a slightly better product mix. This quarter's gross margin also benefitted from the impact of approximately $60 million of revenue related to the assignment of certain manufacturing rights to a customer in our Wired segment, which is included in our original guidance. Turning to OpEx, R&D expenses were $664 million and SG&A expenses were $120 million. This resulted in total operating expenses for the first quarter of $784 million, or 18.9% of net revenue. As Hock mentioned, we have not largely completed the integration of classic Broadcom and I would reiterate that we feel comfortable at this level of operating expenses relative net revenue. Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1.8 billion and represented 43.5% of net revenue. Provision for taxes came in at $77 million, slightly above our guidance. This was primarily due to higher than expected net income. First quarter interest expense of $110 million and other income net was $8 million. First quarter net income was $1.63 billion and earnings per diluted share were $3.63. Our share-based compensation expense in the first quarter was $201 million. Moving on to the balance sheet, our days sales outstanding were 43 days, a decrease of five days from the prior quarter due to better linearity of revenue in the quarter. Our inventory ended at $1.34 billion, a decrease of $64 million from the beginning of the quarter. We generated $1.35 billion in operational cash flow, which reflected the impact of approximately $313 million for annual employee bonus payments for fiscal year 2016 and approximately $80 million of cash expended on classic Broadcom restructuring integration activities including discontinued operations. I'm very pleased that in the first quarter, the business already demonstrated the ability to generate free cash flow close to our long-term target model of 35%, while free cash flow in the first quarter was $1 billion approximately or only 25% of net revenue. This does include I want to highlight the impact from the annual employee cash bonus payment as well as cash restructuring expenses and capital expenditures that as we discussed before running higher than our long-term targets. Looking forward, we expect classic Broadcom related restructuring expenses to continue to decrease as we finish this integration. Capital expenditure in the first quarter was $325 million or 7.8% of net revenue. However, we expect long-term CapEx largely to fabless semiconductor company to run at about 3% of net revenue consistent with that fabless business model. As a reminder for full fiscal year 2017, we expect CapEx to run at an elevated level of approximately $1.2 billion. This includes about $500 million towards campus construction, primarily at our Irvine and San Jose locations and about $200 million towards purchasing of test equipment to consignment at our CMs. A total of $431 million in cash was spent on company dividend and partnership distribution payments in the first quarter. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of approximately $3.5 billion. Now let me turn to non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only. Net revenue is expected to be $4.1 billion plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 62%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $789 million. Tax provision is forecasted to be approximately $74 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $106 million. The diluted share count forecast is for 452 million shares. Share-based compensation expense will be approximately $223 million. CapEx will be approximately $290 million. And you have seen, our Board has declared a dividend of $1.02 per share to be paid later in the second fiscal quarter. We're also looking forward to completing the acquisition of Brocade, which is proceeding as planned and we presently expect to close this transaction in our third quarter of fiscal 2017. I'm pleased that we're able to reach an agreement with ARRIS earlier this quarter for the sale of Brocade's network edge business for $800 million in cash plus the additional cost of unvested employee stock awards. Following Brocade's recent results, we continue to feel very comfortable that Brocade's Fiber Channel San Switching business, the key business that we're focused on will generate approximately $900 million of EBITDA in fiscal 2018. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore Hey guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess Hock the first question is on the Wireless side. It's good to see the content rising at other customers besides just your big North American customer; can you talk a little bit more detail about what's driving that content up? Is there anything unique or is it basically the same goodness that you've seen in the North America side? And any more color about that goodness continuing on the North America side into the second half of this year would also be helpful. Thanks. Hock Tan Yes, Ross thanks for the question. Yes, it's -- in fact it's a phenomenon we have been indicating to you guys for the last several years which is over the medium term -- long-term, I would say, our strength of franchise in cellular and our RF cellular analog, the front end cellular analog, which includes FBAR and power amplifiers and all the circuitry and component that goes in front of the transceiver in the handset for cellular. That's one area and the other area in Wi-Fi Bluetooth connectivity. Those two functionality, those two features in phones continue to evolve and with each generation. And as each generation evolves, when it involves, in the case of RF cellular is two-fold. One is basically more band as we progress -- as more and more countries globally progress into 4G and eventually even further beyond that. More and more bands -- spectral bandwidths get pulled into the fold and number of skills of phones get less and less for any major OEM manufacturer simply because of complexity of these phones. And so because of more bands, it requires more filters, more components like power amplifiers -- low noise amplifiers and because of that necessary content increases. I should also add the difficulty of engineering those products increased fairly exponentially, which therefore drives towards better and better content for us into those very high-end flagship smartphones. In the case of wireless connectivity, the same phenomenon is happening and it's particularly driven on bandwidth on the peer [ph] throughput as we move from -- what we gradually move from what used to be much lower bandwidth in Wi-Fi to today's AC. As we move from to single users to multiple users and as we move next generation from AC into AX and further. Obviously, difficulty of doing those products in smartphones become correspondingly more difficult, content increases and we benefit from basically content increase. It's a normal phenomenon and we expect to see that continuing into the medium term. Ross Seymore Great, that's helpful. I guess for my one follow-up, both you and Tom, Hock, mentioned about the 15% growth not being your long-term assumption. Just wondering why you are bringing that up? Is there something you're seeing now that gives you pause that things are going to slow down or is this just a reminder that the level we are now is not the base assumption in your business model? Hock Tan I think the fairest way to answer that is we have articulated last fiscal year very clearly and even a year ago when we acquired Broadcom, as long as a year ago, that we were scaled and we were diversification of product portfolio. Our long-term model, out five years, 10 years is a compounded annual growth of 5%. Not every year necessarily, but long-term 5%. And why we feel the need to mention it is obviously you saw the numbers we were guiding for Q2 on the topline and they're showing 15% year-on-year from a year ago. That's just one quarter and obviously just one fiscal year, one point in time. So, we felt it necessary to just mention it that do not just take it and extrapolate it to say that we have move away from our broad model on guidance of 5% compounded annual growth in the long term to a 15%, far from it. Tom Krause And Ross, I mean just to add -- I also want to reiterate, we don't believe we need to have this accelerated revenue growth to hit our financial targets which we remain very focused on, specifically the free cash flow margins at 35%. We're very comfortable achieving those results based on a more normalized long-term CAGR of mid-single-digits. Ross Seymore Very well. Congrats on those results. Thanks a lot. Operator Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis Hey guys thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great results. Just following-up on the Wireless guide, you've talked in the past sometimes it can be seasonal down 15%, 20% to the high single-digits. Just curious between contents and the units, what are you seeing with your two large customers in terms of the seasonality and the timing of the ramp magnitude versus the content gains you're seeing? Hock Tan To be -- I don't have specific data between to be able to speed out accurately between units and content, but off the cuff, my sense is it's largely content. Blayne Curtis Okay. And then you mentioned strength in switching, I was curious obviously you don't want to -- for a full year, I was just curious you talked about some businesses being soft in the second half. There's obviously a big upgrade cycle that's 2500G. Just curious your perspective as you look at the rest of the year the trajectory of the switch business? Hock Tan That's a very interesting question and on the switching side, which is a subset, obviously, of our Wired segment, which is our largest segment, but just if you look at our switching and routing sites, fair way to put it together, which is really data center networking business, we continue to see strength through the rest of the year. We see -- a big part of that strength we see is simply because of a very strong data center demand -- data center buildup by the cloud operators. We're seeing that now and I suspect that phenomenon will still continue, particularly when we start to ramp-up newer generation with high-bandwidth of Tomahawks and Tridents and as we go later part in the year of our DMX router and aggregation switches. So, we see that and this momentum to be fairly good based on demand -- intrinsic demand out there in data center expansion, especially into the cloud, but also from the fact that we're launching a few very key new products in this year. Blayne Curtis Thanks. Hock Tan Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Harlan Sur Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question and it's great to see the diversity in the business playing out here. On the strong growth in the storage business that I'm assuming some of this is your SSD product lines; I believe you guys are supplying Enterprise SSD controllers into the top two enterprising cloud SSD suppliers. And I think your top customer here just grew their Enterprise SSD business I think 20% sequentially and 20% year-over-year in the December quarter. Wondering if you guys are seeing similar growth trends? And do you expect double-digit growth in the SSD segment for the full year? Hock Tan I'll be [Indiscernible] our visibility in the SSDs are not as good as perhaps our customers are. A big part of it is there are three parts to our Enterprise Storage, three broad parts, one is very related to storage server connectivity, that's the rate part and the Fiber Channel whole part side of it rate. And then there is the components we ship into hard disk drives. And hard disk drive has experience as you well know a strong surge over the last several months probably because flash have been in short supply. And the last and smallest part of our business in Enterprise Storage is really related to Enterprise flash controllers for SSD. And that's really a small part. So, we don't get that broad visibility into this SSD market as a lot of other people would. But you're, right now, it's very, very strong and especially in SAS. Harlan Sur Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then off of the success of Tomahawks and I also hear that your prior generation Trident is still very strong as well and the team is ramping into this upgrade cycle, but you started sampling Tomahawk II, I think it was second half of last year. Can you just give us an update on the qualification, customer feedback, and when should we see the adoption curve for T2 starting to ramp, is that going to be kind of 2018 timeframe? Hock Tan For very competitive reasons I really hate to give you specifics here. Suffice to say it's very well received. We have a lot of momentum on our entire switch portfolio. And by the way as Tomahawk doesn't fully replace Trident, Trident is using a different segment versus Tomahawk and both are going very well as are the Jericho products, which are more aggregation switching and routing. So, broadly our portfolio of -- from high end down to even low range -- on the low-end range of switching -- campus switching pointers [ph], those are all going very well. And I suspect it's all largely due to the strength in data center spending that still receive continue, particularly more recently since we had very strong conversion of Enterprises into the cloud. Harlan Sur Thanks Hock. Operator Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great. Thanks so much for taking my question and congrats on the very strong results and outlook. I wanted to address the free cash flow margin trajectory. Tom I think you referred to some of this in your prepared remarks, but I'd like you to maybe highlight what aside from the restructuring expenses that are still being paid and the temporarily higher CapEx that you are experiencing, what are the other drivers to get you to the 35% free cash flow margin? And what sort of timing should we think about for that? Tom Krause William good question and I think that's sort of the point of the prepared remarks. And if you look at where we are from an operating margin perspective, you look at the fact we restructured the balance sheet around now fixed rate debt. If you look at our sustainable tax rate of 4.5% and cash taxes of approximately $100 million a quarter and you take out the restructuring costs, which are bleeding off here pretty quickly, you take out the one-time campus initiative, the one-time tester initiative this year which will sort of play itself out over the next couple of quarters. Frankly, we're largely there. And that's probably the real takeaway and of course that doesn't take into account what we would expect to be the second half seasonally up trends from a revenue perspective. William Stein It's helpful. Appreciate it. Maybe one more. Something that came up last quarter was the change in capital allocation strategy. Maybe you can sort of highlight for us your plans on the M&A front from here despite the higher dividend -- the significantly higher free cash flow that you are going to be generating I guess after these temporary expenses falloff would seem to meet to continue to support a good M&A pipeline. Maybe you can characterize for us please? Tom Krause Yes, I mean there's no real uptick there other than we outlined very clearly that we're going to continue to drive given back 50% of free cash flows to investors in the form of dividends, which, of course, at these levels, would imply that we're going to have the ability to continue to increase the dividend pretty meaningfully here over the next couple of years certainly. Beyond that we've used M&A to drive returns, obviously, over the last several years pretty effectively. We continue to see opportunities to do that. Brocade is the latest example of being able to put capital work and an interesting opportunity that drives better returns than our alternative. So, we're going to continue to do that, but given our scale, we have the opportunity to do that mostly off the balance sheet, particularly with smallest opportunities that arise. William Stein Great. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Vinay Jaising Hello, this is Vinay Jaising calling in for Craig. Thanks for giving the opportunity to ask the question. So, I wanted touch upon carrier aggregation, like this is one of the key growth drivers for RF business. Hock, can you provide us an update on the trends you're seeing by geography for that? And what that means for your portfolio? Hock Tan Okay. Carrier aggregation as you well know is the phenomenon of especially benefiting operators who have multiple spectral bandwidth, not necessarily one but multiple, and interest of reducing CapEx infrastructure is the phenomenon of enabling those bandwidths to max together into one, which creates much more capacity throughput and that's not only in infrastructure, it goes into the phone. And we are probably one of the leading enablers in the phone of making that happen simply because not just of architectural design of the cellular RF analog, but also the fact that FBAR filters which are FBAR, are much better performing and more integral -- have been able to integrate it into a module to allow of that maxing and de-maxing separate spectral bands. And that's happening. It started very aggressively obviously in China continuing to be very much so in China. It's also happening very aggressively in the U.S. Those are the two biggest geographies where a lot of that is happening, started with downlink last year, I think, and it's now moving on to up-linking, not just downlinking, which, of course, then part of reason why it's helping create -- not the only reason, but one of the reasons creating increased content in a cellular RF demand. So, it's great for us and we see that phenomenon continuing to grow and expand into other regions of the world. Vinay Jaising Got it, that's helpful. And for my follow-up, I want to touch upon gross margins. Pretty good performance in gross margin during the quarter and the guidance, but I was thinking about how should we think about gross margins for here? And if you can outline like what are the top two drivers of gross margin expansion as we look out towards rest of fiscal 2017? Hock Tan Okay. Well, it's a very interesting point and as we -- if you look back to a year ago when we just closed the Broadcom transaction every quarter since then, we have been able to expand our gross margin in the range of roughly 40, 50 basis points sequentially. A big part of it is as we settle down the portfolio, as we start to get the benefit of larger scale in purchasing materials and as very specific actions like taking -- basically bringing testing very much in-house and consigning testers to contract manufacturers instead of leasing test time for our huge volume of semiconductor chips. All those various actions -- a lot of a big part of this expansion of gross margin comes from a scale and ability to leverage on the scale in direct materials. It also helps that our product margin as we move from one generation to the other, keeps getting richer in terms of the mix. So, that's a combination of those two things. And in terms of where will it go from here? Frankly, I don't know. Best indicator is probably to look at history. Vinay Jaising Got it, that's helpful, and congrats once again on a good quarter. Hock Tan Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. For my first one you've talked a lot about free cash flow margins, but I wanted to dig a little bit into the payout ratio. You are paying out right now about a little over 30%, target is 50%. Should we think about that sort of level going up to 50% in line with the margins going up to 35% or more? Or like how should we think about the trajectory of reaching your target on the payout ratio that seems like something that's more in your control maybe even quicker than the margins themselves? Tom Krause Well, they kind of go hand-in-hand Stacy. I think what we're going to do and so articulate in the past is we're going to get to the end of the fiscal year, we're going to look back at the free cash flow trajectory on those margins over the course of that previous year. We're going to look at the business; obviously, we're very focused on sustainability. And then we're going to pay out 50%. And so all you are seeing is the general trajectory improving from where we exited last year to where we are here exiting Q1 and guiding Q2. And you're right consistent with the policy as we get to the end of the year where we will achieve expectations that we're going to have -- obviously be in the position to raise that dividend consistent with getting back 50% on an LTM basis. Stacy Rasgon Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. For my follow-up I also wanted to dig into gross margins a little bit. You talked a little bit about the drivers, but I heard you say earlier that you're sort of comfortable with your level of OpEx spending as a percentage of revenue, which implies that the operating margin improvement toward the model from here comes from gross margins, but it's not that much, only about 150, maybe 200 basis points from where we are. And this is even before you buy Brocade, which comes in at gross margins in the 70s. so, given all the levers that you just talk about and Brocade coming in, why should 64%, 65%, which is where that would take you -- why should that be the upper limit? Like how should we think about this if we're going farther, I don't see any reason why shouldn't expect gross margins to go even higher than that unless there something else -- mix or something else that ought to be taking it down. Can you talk about that a little bit? Tom Krause Well, Stacy, it's -- actually I think we're going to get into the gross margin where we think we can go and if I go all the way back to the original Avago first margins in the 30s, obviously we're always focused on continuing to improve on our gross margin. I think the second part of the question is we are in our seasonally weak part of the year and so when you do look at the general seasonality of the business and where things are, I think you could take a whole fiscal year approach to looking at where operating margins will land and could land and apply that to how you're thinking about the model. That's the only guidance I'd give you. Stacy Rasgon Got it. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Vivek Arya Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on the good results and the consistent execution. For my first one, Hock, your Wired business has essentially been in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range for the past year on a quarterly basis. Can you give us some puts and takes on what's done well, what's been different than expectations? Because my rate is that the switching parts has probably done fairly well with all the cloud opportunities, but your broadband access and set-top boxes has perhaps not done so well. But then on the prepared remarks you mentioned you are starting to see a little bit of a pick up on the broadband access side. So, just if you could give us a look back on what was different than expectations? And then as we look forward to this year, could we see contribution from both parts of Wired -- both the cable side as well as the switching side? Hock Tan That's a very interest -- good question actually, very insightful and let me try to explain it on our Wired business. You're right, it's our biggest segment and in simple terms broadly, there are two groups of products here and end markets. There's switching and routing, you correctly put out and that come from various fronts from standard switching and routing, as well ASICs, which is also part in there, as would be building block products as well as fiber optics components. That business is very Enterprise driven directly and has actually done very well even on a year-on-year -- especially on a year-on-year basis because it's growing as we move from 10-gigabit few years ago -- couple of years ago, to increasingly 25 and 100 coming out very fast. As that transition happens very fast, obviously it's driving and you always hear products like Trident going to Tomahawk, especially in the very high end and at Jericho. All these are related to data center switching and that's very, very -- that's driving growth on all infrastructure on a very stable basis, but driving growth very nicely close to high single-digits, even double-digits. Then the other part of the segment, which is pretty big too, is our broadband. And here the set-top box on the CP side and access gateways like DSL/PON on the infrastructure side. And here the business is stable; it's very stable, has been stable for the last couple -- few years and continues to be very stable and it's also very seasonal. And you will see that the later part of second half of the year is typically when it drives up and in the first half of the year is when it shows a seasonal decline. Hence in my opening remarks, I was mentioning that Q1 -- fiscal Q1 is probably a very seasonal low point and it gradually picks up seasonally later part of Q2, but certainly Q3, and then starts rolling over again, but if you look at it year-on-year, relatively very stable. So, we have a confluence of two segments mixed together in our Wired business which is what you're seeing. It dilutes basically the strength, the growth of switching and routing, but nonetheless, both are very franchise product, very franchise business and drives stability in this company. Vivek Arya Thanks Hock. And as my follow-up question, it's a somewhat longer term question. You're obviously doing quite well in the Wireless business and that can continue for some time. The cloud business is also doing quite well. But when I talk with a lot of your peers and ask them about growth in semis over the next three to five years, they talk about connected cars or Internet of Things, or machine learning, or 5G. Do you beer Broadcom is investing adequately to pursue those markets? Is there a part of the company that is looking at those longer term areas? Or do you think M&A is the better way to address some of those things as they become real over time? Thank you. Hock Tan Great question. Giving the opportunity to expand a little propaganda here, again, as we've already articulated. The franchise products we're in, the -- we are the technology; we are also the market leader in those areas. In those niches, some of them are very large niche, but we are the technology leader and we don't get there by not investing. We invested, as my remarks said and I said many times, very heavily in those areas we are in. We develop products that generally in those franchise areas before anybody else do it out there. And that's why we can sustain it, that's why our margins are the way it is because we provide products that allow our customers to differentiate and innovate themselves. So, we invest very heavily and you look at our total R&D, we invest in total $2.7 billion a year as a company in R&D. We're the best engineers out there; we have the best products in this area. So, that's really where we continue to sustain leadership in our existing franchise products. In some of those flights of fantasy somewhat that you covered earlier, we're not -- I'm not saying it won't happen. I will be direct, let somebody else take another hits and then we'll buy the company if it's successful. Thank you. Vivek Arya Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from [Indiscernible] with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter. I had one short-term question and then another longer term question. On the short-term question, with regards to Wireless, you talked about trends at you're Korean customer offsetting the seasonal trends at you're North American customer and therefore you are guiding Q2 to be down only high single-digits relative to history being down about 15%, I recall. Is the upside versus historical seasonality, is that all coming from dynamics at you're Korean customer or dynamics in terms of units or content at your North American customer trending better than history as well? Hock Tan You are really trying to pass the data, aren't you? It's all a combination really. It is -- and you obviously know out there it's also timing of some of the shipments and purchases by our two largest customers. So, there's a bunch of -- a few factors involved in here. One of which was there's timing this quarter differences in timing. There's the fact that you're right, Korean customer is coming in with a vengeance to try to recover share. And broadly, we're also talking about content increases as each new generation comes in and it's not even the Korean customer it's also the major North American customer. And it's a mix of all these factors. Have I sat down and broken it out in detail? No. We don't try to analyze it to that in degree, but those multiple factors mix pull together to basically indicate that the seasonality -- the downward seasonality that we saw a year ago is perhaps less pronounced this year. Unidentified Analyst Okay, great. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, another question on Wireless, specifically around China. Obviously, you're tied to the North American customer and the Korean customer in a big way today, but when you think about your Wireless business and your RF business specifically, on say a three-year view, how do you think about the opportunity in China today? Hock Tan Well, there are opportunities for us in China, and -- but the focus of our success and our product success in Wireless, especially content increases year-on-year is -- as you know, we push the cutting edge on technology. Be it wireless Wi-Fi connectivity or RF cellular, we push the envelope and that tends to go very much largely to the flagship class phones. That top of the pyramid where a big part of it has been our major North American customer and Korean customer, plus a few other guys spread around. That's where our strength is, that's where the demand and value seen our products can have. As China evolve over time, having said that, the opportunity exists, they will move from feature phones to low-end smartphones to now some premium phones. And we begin to get traction on even those premium phones to the extent that those brands in China use it, and that's why we need the technological engineering edge that we provide in the products. Until then, they need less of it. Except -- with exceptions like carrier aggregation when we obviously are the leader in providing solutions for carrier aggregation on a discrete basis. But on an integrated basis into smartphones, it's really the flagship phones and now increasingly premium phones making its way into flagship phones that we see the demand. And that transition is happening in China, albeit, on a very gradual basis, but we're very patient people, we'll wait for it. Unidentified Analyst Thank you. Operator And our last question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for sneaking me and congratulations. Hock, my first question is kind of a follow-up on the Enterprise Storage side. You rightfully pointed out that today, the SSD controller businesses is the smallest part of that business. I'm kind pf curious as you look out over time, do you see that market developing similar and potentially getting to be the size of the HDD controller market? Or is there something inherent about the growing complexity of raw NAND itself, which means there will always be a large portion of that controller market which is insourced, the guys building demand actually building their own controller. Do you think eventually you will end up in situation where it's all outsourced? Hock Tan That's a very insightful question and we see the SSD controllers for Enterprise to be a lot of it will be outsourced. Why? Because there are certain IP inherent in those Enterprise flash controllers that are very tricky to do. Not dissimilar from the re-channel of hard disk drives, so that will happen. [Indiscernible], because the nature of [Indiscernible], it's not so complex technology, IP required is not so extreme. We see that as probably less opportunistic for us, though one never knows. But certainly on Enterprise, which is where we are very focused on, we see a lot of need for intellectual property blocks features that few people can do. And we are one of those few people who can do it very well. John Pitzer That's helpful. And then, Hock, as my follow-up, I think a lot of us in the investment community understand the Wireless, both on the RF and on the connectivity side, the content ASP story. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about that same dynamic in your Wired business. And maybe differentiate between switching and routing versus set-top box and broadband access? How do we think about the ASP trends in those two segments over time? Or just your content going into the CapEx dollars being spent in the Wired market? Hock Tan Well, if you talk about switching and routing, it's really more than just chips -- building blocks of chips. It's really as much an architectural play, especially in the high end top of the rack, in the [Indiscernible] and the spine side of the data centers. And here is where our model just goes beyond selling pieces of silicon; we sell a lot of firmware and software that goes hand in hand to enable those chips to work with multiple OEM customers at the end of the day. So, that's a very interesting model for us and what is overriding all of this is obviously the need for more larger and larger more and more throughput, especially, in data centers, and especially in top of the rack and all the way to the spine. So, we have big advantages in this area simply because of the strength of the intellectual property we have in making very complex engineering, very complex SoCs, but also interface very high-speed interfaces or [Indiscernible] as we call it. So, all that plays to our advantage of being able to do it. And we continue to do that, and we continue to -- it goes from 10-gigabit to 25 to 50 to 100 and maybe -- and going on in the future to 200-gigabit to 400-gigabit. We believe we are investing heavily to ensure that we can develop those kind of products and develop it first and better than anybody else. So, -- and with that expansion of features, we benefit from content increases, simply because you are providing a customer more throughput and it's not a one-on-one scaling, it's more and more -- it's a lot of value for our customers to be able to go from 25-gigabit -- or 10-gigabit to 100 in the next year or two and we provide a lot of value in that. And by the way, in broadband, it's not dissimilar. Except that maybe it's not evolving as rapidly simply because it's a much more stable market, for instance, you hear about now 4K TVs video delivery to moving on to high definition, HD, and eventually moving even to 8K. That would be interesting to see how 8K is going to be accepted since the human eye may not even notice the difference, but people want it. And they want that, we're able to provide that. But it might take a bit longer, that's why I said broadband to us is a much -- we look at it as a much more stable gradually evolving market, even as OTT, the hype behind OTT and all that comes play which we participate in. But in data centers, it's serious stuff. More and more data are being basically pushed through pipes stored, processed as social media keeps expanding. And that's why we are seeing this past quarter and current quarter extraordinary strength in the demand for switching and routing. John Pitzer That's great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore Hey guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess Hock the first question is on the Wireless side. It's good to see the content rising at other customers besides just your big North American customer; can you talk a little bit more detail about what's driving that content up? Is there anything unique or is it basically the same goodness that you've seen in the North America side? And any more color about that goodness continuing on the North America side into the second half of this year would also be helpful. Thanks. Hock Tan Yes, Ross thanks for the question. Yes, it's -- in fact it's a phenomenon we have been indicating to you guys for the last several years which is over the medium term -- long-term, I would say, our strength of franchise in cellular and our RF cellular analog, the front end cellular analog, which includes FBAR and power amplifiers and all the circuitry and component that goes in front of the transceiver in the handset for cellular. That's one area and the other area in Wi-Fi Bluetooth connectivity. Those two functionality, those two features in phones continue to evolve and with each generation. And as each generation evolves, when it involves, in the case of RF cellular is two-fold. One is basically more band as we progress -- as more and more countries globally progress into 4G and eventually even further beyond that. More and more bands -- spectral bandwidths get pulled into the fold and number of skills of phones get less and less for any major OEM manufacturer simply because of complexity of these phones. And so because of more bands, it requires more filters, more components like power amplifiers -- low noise amplifiers and because of that necessary content increases. I should also add the difficulty of engineering those products increased fairly exponentially, which therefore drives towards better and better content for us into those very high-end flagship smartphones. In the case of wireless connectivity, the same phenomenon is happening and it's particularly driven on bandwidth on the peer [ph] throughput as we move from -- what we gradually move from what used to be much lower bandwidth in Wi-Fi to today's AC. As we move from to single users to multiple users and as we move next generation from AC into AX and further. Obviously, difficulty of doing those products in smartphones become correspondingly more difficult, content increases and we benefit from basically content increase. It's a normal phenomenon and we expect to see that continuing into the medium term. Ross Seymore Great, that's helpful. I guess for my one follow-up, both you and Tom, Hock, mentioned about the 15% growth not being your long-term assumption. Just wondering why you are bringing that up? Is there something you're seeing now that gives you pause that things are going to slow down or is this just a reminder that the level we are now is not the base assumption in your business model? Hock Tan I think the fairest way to answer that is we have articulated last fiscal year very clearly and even a year ago when we acquired Broadcom, as long as a year ago, that we were scaled and we were diversification of product portfolio. Our long-term model, out five years, 10 years is a compounded annual growth of 5%. Not every year necessarily, but long-term 5%. And why we feel the need to mention it is obviously you saw the numbers we were guiding for Q2 on the topline and they're showing 15% year-on-year from a year ago. That's just one quarter and obviously just one fiscal year, one point in time. So, we felt it necessary to just mention it that do not just take it and extrapolate it to say that we have move away from our broad model on guidance of 5% compounded annual growth in the long term to a 15%, far from it. Tom Krause And Ross, I mean just to add -- I also want to reiterate, we don't believe we need to have this accelerated revenue growth to hit our financial targets which we remain very focused on, specifically the free cash flow margins at 35%. We're very comfortable achieving those results based on a more normalized long-term CAGR of mid-single-digits. Ross Seymore Very well. Congrats on those results. Thanks a lot. Operator Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis Hey guys thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great results. Just following-up on the Wireless guide, you've talked in the past sometimes it can be seasonal down 15%, 20% to the high single-digits. Just curious between contents and the units, what are you seeing with your two large customers in terms of the seasonality and the timing of the ramp magnitude versus the content gains you're seeing? Hock Tan To be -- I don't have specific data between to be able to speed out accurately between units and content, but off the cuff, my sense is it's largely content. Blayne Curtis Okay. And then you mentioned strength in switching, I was curious obviously you don't want to -- for a full year, I was just curious you talked about some businesses being soft in the second half. There's obviously a big upgrade cycle that's 2500G. Just curious your perspective as you look at the rest of the year the trajectory of the switch business? Hock Tan That's a very interesting question and on the switching side, which is a subset, obviously, of our Wired segment, which is our largest segment, but just if you look at our switching and routing sites, fair way to put it together, which is really data center networking business, we continue to see strength through the rest of the year. We see -- a big part of that strength we see is simply because of a very strong data center demand -- data center buildup by the cloud operators. We're seeing that now and I suspect that phenomenon will still continue, particularly when we start to ramp-up newer generation with high-bandwidth of Tomahawks and Tridents and as we go later part in the year of our DMX router and aggregation switches. So, we see that and this momentum to be fairly good based on demand -- intrinsic demand out there in data center expansion, especially into the cloud, but also from the fact that we're launching a few very key new products in this year. Blayne Curtis Thanks. Hock Tan Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Harlan Sur Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question and it's great to see the diversity in the business playing out here. On the strong growth in the storage business that I'm assuming some of this is your SSD product lines; I believe you guys are supplying Enterprise SSD controllers into the top two enterprising cloud SSD suppliers. And I think your top customer here just grew their Enterprise SSD business I think 20% sequentially and 20% year-over-year in the December quarter. Wondering if you guys are seeing similar growth trends? And do you expect double-digit growth in the SSD segment for the full year? Hock Tan I'll be [Indiscernible] our visibility in the SSDs are not as good as perhaps our customers are. A big part of it is there are three parts to our Enterprise Storage, three broad parts, one is very related to storage server connectivity, that's the rate part and the Fiber Channel whole part side of it rate. And then there is the components we ship into hard disk drives. And hard disk drive has experience as you well know a strong surge over the last several months probably because flash have been in short supply. And the last and smallest part of our business in Enterprise Storage is really related to Enterprise flash controllers for SSD. And that's really a small part. So, we don't get that broad visibility into this SSD market as a lot of other people would. But you're, right now, it's very, very strong and especially in SAS. Harlan Sur Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then off of the success of Tomahawks and I also hear that your prior generation Trident is still very strong as well and the team is ramping into this upgrade cycle, but you started sampling Tomahawk II, I think it was second half of last year. Can you just give us an update on the qualification, customer feedback, and when should we see the adoption curve for T2 starting to ramp, is that going to be kind of 2018 timeframe? Hock Tan For very competitive reasons I really hate to give you specifics here. Suffice to say it's very well received. We have a lot of momentum on our entire switch portfolio. And by the way as Tomahawk doesn't fully replace Trident, Trident is using a different segment versus Tomahawk and both are going very well as are the Jericho products, which are more aggregation switching and routing. So, broadly our portfolio of -- from high end down to even low range -- on the low-end range of switching -- campus switching pointers [ph], those are all going very well. And I suspect it's all largely due to the strength in data center spending that still receive continue, particularly more recently since we had very strong conversion of Enterprises into the cloud. Harlan Sur Thanks Hock. Operator Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great. Thanks so much for taking my question and congrats on the very strong results and outlook. I wanted to address the free cash flow margin trajectory. Tom I think you referred to some of this in your prepared remarks, but I'd like you to maybe highlight what aside from the restructuring expenses that are still being paid and the temporarily higher CapEx that you are experiencing, what are the other drivers to get you to the 35% free cash flow margin? And what sort of timing should we think about for that? Tom Krause William good question and I think that's sort of the point of the prepared remarks. And if you look at where we are from an operating margin perspective, you look at the fact we restructured the balance sheet around now fixed rate debt. If you look at our sustainable tax rate of 4.5% and cash taxes of approximately $100 million a quarter and you take out the restructuring costs, which are bleeding off here pretty quickly, you take out the one-time campus initiative, the one-time tester initiative this year which will sort of play itself out over the next couple of quarters. Frankly, we're largely there. And that's probably the real takeaway and of course that doesn't take into account what we would expect to be the second half seasonally up trends from a revenue perspective. William Stein It's helpful. Appreciate it. Maybe one more. Something that came up last quarter was the change in capital allocation strategy. Maybe you can sort of highlight for us your plans on the M&A front from here despite the higher dividend -- the significantly higher free cash flow that you are going to be generating I guess after these temporary expenses falloff would seem to meet to continue to support a good M&A pipeline. Maybe you can characterize for us please? Tom Krause Yes, I mean there's no real uptick there other than we outlined very clearly that we're going to continue to drive given back 50% of free cash flows to investors in the form of dividends, which, of course, at these levels, would imply that we're going to have the ability to continue to increase the dividend pretty meaningfully here over the next couple of years certainly. Beyond that we've used M&A to drive returns, obviously, over the last several years pretty effectively. We continue to see opportunities to do that. Brocade is the latest example of being able to put capital work and an interesting opportunity that drives better returns than our alternative. So, we're going to continue to do that, but given our scale, we have the opportunity to do that mostly off the balance sheet, particularly with smallest opportunities that arise. William Stein Great. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Vinay Jaising Hello, this is Vinay Jaising calling in for Craig. Thanks for giving the opportunity to ask the question. So, I wanted touch upon carrier aggregation, like this is one of the key growth drivers for RF business. Hock, can you provide us an update on the trends you're seeing by geography for that? And what that means for your portfolio? Hock Tan Okay. Carrier aggregation as you well know is the phenomenon of especially benefiting operators who have multiple spectral bandwidth, not necessarily one but multiple, and interest of reducing CapEx infrastructure is the phenomenon of enabling those bandwidths to max together into one, which creates much more capacity throughput and that's not only in infrastructure, it goes into the phone. And we are probably one of the leading enablers in the phone of making that happen simply because not just of architectural design of the cellular RF analog, but also the fact that FBAR filters which are FBAR, are much better performing and more integral -- have been able to integrate it into a module to allow of that maxing and de-maxing separate spectral bands. And that's happening. It started very aggressively obviously in China continuing to be very much so in China. It's also happening very aggressively in the U.S. Those are the two biggest geographies where a lot of that is happening, started with downlink last year, I think, and it's now moving on to up-linking, not just downlinking, which, of course, then part of reason why it's helping create -- not the only reason, but one of the reasons creating increased content in a cellular RF demand. So, it's great for us and we see that phenomenon continuing to grow and expand into other regions of the world. Vinay Jaising Got it, that's helpful. And for my follow-up, I want to touch upon gross margins. Pretty good performance in gross margin during the quarter and the guidance, but I was thinking about how should we think about gross margins for here? And if you can outline like what are the top two drivers of gross margin expansion as we look out towards rest of fiscal 2017? Hock Tan Okay. Well, it's a very interesting point and as we -- if you look back to a year ago when we just closed the Broadcom transaction every quarter since then, we have been able to expand our gross margin in the range of roughly 40, 50 basis points sequentially. A big part of it is as we settle down the portfolio, as we start to get the benefit of larger scale in purchasing materials and as very specific actions like taking -- basically bringing testing very much in-house and consigning testers to contract manufacturers instead of leasing test time for our huge volume of semiconductor chips. All those various actions -- a lot of a big part of this expansion of gross margin comes from a scale and ability to leverage on the scale in direct materials. It also helps that our product margin as we move from one generation to the other, keeps getting richer in terms of the mix. So, that's a combination of those two things. And in terms of where will it go from here? Frankly, I don't know. Best indicator is probably to look at history. Vinay Jaising Got it, that's helpful, and congrats once again on a good quarter. Hock Tan Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. For my first one you've talked a lot about free cash flow margins, but I wanted to dig a little bit into the payout ratio. You are paying out right now about a little over 30%, target is 50%. Should we think about that sort of level going up to 50% in line with the margins going up to 35% or more? Or like how should we think about the trajectory of reaching your target on the payout ratio that seems like something that's more in your control maybe even quicker than the margins themselves? Tom Krause Well, they kind of go hand-in-hand Stacy. I think what we're going to do and so articulate in the past is we're going to get to the end of the fiscal year, we're going to look back at the free cash flow trajectory on those margins over the course of that previous year. We're going to look at the business; obviously, we're very focused on sustainability. And then we're going to pay out 50%. And so all you are seeing is the general trajectory improving from where we exited last year to where we are here exiting Q1 and guiding Q2. And you're right consistent with the policy as we get to the end of the year where we will achieve expectations that we're going to have -- obviously be in the position to raise that dividend consistent with getting back 50% on an LTM basis. Stacy Rasgon Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. For my follow-up I also wanted to dig into gross margins a little bit. You talked a little bit about the drivers, but I heard you say earlier that you're sort of comfortable with your level of OpEx spending as a percentage of revenue, which implies that the operating margin improvement toward the model from here comes from gross margins, but it's not that much, only about 150, maybe 200 basis points from where we are. And this is even before you buy Brocade, which comes in at gross margins in the 70s. so, given all the levers that you just talk about and Brocade coming in, why should 64%, 65%, which is where that would take you -- why should that be the upper limit? Like how should we think about this if we're going farther, I don't see any reason why shouldn't expect gross margins to go even higher than that unless there something else -- mix or something else that ought to be taking it down. Can you talk about that a little bit? Tom Krause Well, Stacy, it's -- actually I think we're going to get into the gross margin where we think we can go and if I go all the way back to the original Avago first margins in the 30s, obviously we're always focused on continuing to improve on our gross margin. I think the second part of the question is we are in our seasonally weak part of the year and so when you do look at the general seasonality of the business and where things are, I think you could take a whole fiscal year approach to looking at where operating margins will land and could land and apply that to how you're thinking about the model. That's the only guidance I'd give you. Stacy Rasgon Got it. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Vivek Arya Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on the good results and the consistent execution. For my first one, Hock, your Wired business has essentially been in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range for the past year on a quarterly basis. Can you give us some puts and takes on what's done well, what's been different than expectations? Because my rate is that the switching parts has probably done fairly well with all the cloud opportunities, but your broadband access and set-top boxes has perhaps not done so well. But then on the prepared remarks you mentioned you are starting to see a little bit of a pick up on the broadband access side. So, just if you could give us a look back on what was different than expectations? And then as we look forward to this year, could we see contribution from both parts of Wired -- both the cable side as well as the switching side? Hock Tan That's a very interest -- good question actually, very insightful and let me try to explain it on our Wired business. You're right, it's our biggest segment and in simple terms broadly, there are two groups of products here and end markets. There's switching and routing, you correctly put out and that come from various fronts from standard switching and routing, as well ASICs, which is also part in there, as would be building block products as well as fiber optics components. That business is very Enterprise driven directly and has actually done very well even on a year-on-year -- especially on a year-on-year basis because it's growing as we move from 10-gigabit few years ago -- couple of years ago, to increasingly 25 and 100 coming out very fast. As that transition happens very fast, obviously it's driving and you always hear products like Trident going to Tomahawk, especially in the very high end and at Jericho. All these are related to data center switching and that's very, very -- that's driving growth on all infrastructure on a very stable basis, but driving growth very nicely close to high single-digits, even double-digits. Then the other part of the segment, which is pretty big too, is our broadband. And here the set-top box on the CP side and access gateways like DSL/PON on the infrastructure side. And here the business is stable; it's very stable, has been stable for the last couple -- few years and continues to be very stable and it's also very seasonal. And you will see that the later part of second half of the year is typically when it drives up and in the first half of the year is when it shows a seasonal decline. Hence in my opening remarks, I was mentioning that Q1 -- fiscal Q1 is probably a very seasonal low point and it gradually picks up seasonally later part of Q2, but certainly Q3, and then starts rolling over again, but if you look at it year-on-year, relatively very stable. So, we have a confluence of two segments mixed together in our Wired business which is what you're seeing. It dilutes basically the strength, the growth of switching and routing, but nonetheless, both are very franchise product, very franchise business and drives stability in this company. Vivek Arya Thanks Hock. And as my follow-up question, it's a somewhat longer term question. You're obviously doing quite well in the Wireless business and that can continue for some time. The cloud business is also doing quite well. But when I talk with a lot of your peers and ask them about growth in semis over the next three to five years, they talk about connected cars or Internet of Things, or machine learning, or 5G. Do you beer Broadcom is investing adequately to pursue those markets? Is there a part of the company that is looking at those longer term areas? Or do you think M&A is the better way to address some of those things as they become real over time? Thank you. Hock Tan Great question. Giving the opportunity to expand a little propaganda here, again, as we've already articulated. The franchise products we're in, the -- we are the technology; we are also the market leader in those areas. In those niches, some of them are very large niche, but we are the technology leader and we don't get there by not investing. We invested, as my remarks said and I said many times, very heavily in those areas we are in. We develop products that generally in those franchise areas before anybody else do it out there. And that's why we can sustain it, that's why our margins are the way it is because we provide products that allow our customers to differentiate and innovate themselves. So, we invest very heavily and you look at our total R&D, we invest in total $2.7 billion a year as a company in R&D. We're the best engineers out there; we have the best products in this area. So, that's really where we continue to sustain leadership in our existing franchise products. In some of those flights of fantasy somewhat that you covered earlier, we're not -- I'm not saying it won't happen. I will be direct, let somebody else take another hits and then we'll buy the company if it's successful. Thank you. Vivek Arya Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from [Indiscernible] with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter. I had one short-term question and then another longer term question. On the short-term question, with regards to Wireless, you talked about trends at you're Korean customer offsetting the seasonal trends at you're North American customer and therefore you are guiding Q2 to be down only high single-digits relative to history being down about 15%, I recall. Is the upside versus historical seasonality, is that all coming from dynamics at you're Korean customer or dynamics in terms of units or content at your North American customer trending better than history as well? Hock Tan You are really trying to pass the data, aren't you? It's all a combination really. It is -- and you obviously know out there it's also timing of some of the shipments and purchases by our two largest customers. So, there's a bunch of -- a few factors involved in here. One of which was there's timing this quarter differences in timing. There's the fact that you're right, Korean customer is coming in with a vengeance to try to recover share. And broadly, we're also talking about content increases as each new generation comes in and it's not even the Korean customer it's also the major North American customer. And it's a mix of all these factors. Have I sat down and broken it out in detail? No. We don't try to analyze it to that in degree, but those multiple factors mix pull together to basically indicate that the seasonality -- the downward seasonality that we saw a year ago is perhaps less pronounced this year. Unidentified Analyst Okay, great. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, another question on Wireless, specifically around China. Obviously, you're tied to the North American customer and the Korean customer in a big way today, but when you think about your Wireless business and your RF business specifically, on say a three-year view, how do you think about the opportunity in China today? Hock Tan Well, there are opportunities for us in China, and -- but the focus of our success and our product success in Wireless, especially content increases year-on-year is -- as you know, we push the cutting edge on technology. Be it wireless Wi-Fi connectivity or RF cellular, we push the envelope and that tends to go very much largely to the flagship class phones. That top of the pyramid where a big part of it has been our major North American customer and Korean customer, plus a few other guys spread around. That's where our strength is, that's where the demand and value seen our products can have. As China evolve over time, having said that, the opportunity exists, they will move from feature phones to low-end smartphones to now some premium phones. And we begin to get traction on even those premium phones to the extent that those brands in China use it, and that's why we need the technological engineering edge that we provide in the products. Until then, they need less of it. Except -- with exceptions like carrier aggregation when we obviously are the leader in providing solutions for carrier aggregation on a discrete basis. But on an integrated basis into smartphones, it's really the flagship phones and now increasingly premium phones making its way into flagship phones that we see the demand. And that transition is happening in China, albeit, on a very gradual basis, but we're very patient people, we'll wait for it. Unidentified Analyst Thank you. Operator And our last question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for sneaking me and congratulations. Hock, my first question is kind of a follow-up on the Enterprise Storage side. You rightfully pointed out that today, the SSD controller businesses is the smallest part of that business. I'm kind pf curious as you look out over time, do you see that market developing similar and potentially getting to be the size of the HDD controller market? Or is there something inherent about the growing complexity of raw NAND itself, which means there will always be a large portion of that controller market which is insourced, the guys building demand actually building their own controller. Do you think eventually you will end up in situation where it's all outsourced? Hock Tan That's a very insightful question and we see the SSD controllers for Enterprise to be a lot of it will be outsourced. Why? Because there are certain IP inherent in those Enterprise flash controllers that are very tricky to do. Not dissimilar from the re-channel of hard disk drives, so that will happen. [Indiscernible], because the nature of [Indiscernible], it's not so complex technology, IP required is not so extreme. We see that as probably less opportunistic for us, though one never knows. But certainly on Enterprise, which is where we are very focused on, we see a lot of need for intellectual property blocks features that few people can do. And we are one of those few people who can do it very well. John Pitzer That's helpful. And then, Hock, as my follow-up, I think a lot of us in the investment community understand the Wireless, both on the RF and on the connectivity side, the content ASP story. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about that same dynamic in your Wired business. And maybe differentiate between switching and routing versus set-top box and broadband access? How do we think about the ASP trends in those two segments over time? Or just your content going into the CapEx dollars being spent in the Wired market? Hock Tan Well, if you talk about switching and routing, it's really more than just chips -- building blocks of chips. It's really as much an architectural play, especially in the high end top of the rack, in the [Indiscernible] and the spine side of the data centers. And here is where our model just goes beyond selling pieces of silicon; we sell a lot of firmware and software that goes hand in hand to enable those chips to work with multiple OEM customers at the end of the day. So, that's a very interesting model for us and what is overriding all of this is obviously the need for more larger and larger more and more throughput, especially, in data centers, and especially in top of the rack and all the way to the spine. So, we have big advantages in this area simply because of the strength of the intellectual property we have in making very complex engineering, very complex SoCs, but also interface very high-speed interfaces or [Indiscernible] as we call it. So, all that plays to our advantage of being able to do it. And we continue to do that, and we continue to -- it goes from 10-gigabit to 25 to 50 to 100 and maybe -- and going on in the future to 200-gigabit to 400-gigabit. We believe we are investing heavily to ensure that we can develop those kind of products and develop it first and better than anybody else. So, -- and with that expansion of features, we benefit from content increases, simply because you are providing a customer more throughput and it's not a one-on-one scaling, it's more and more -- it's a lot of value for our customers to be able to go from 25-gigabit -- or 10-gigabit to 100 in the next year or two and we provide a lot of value in that. And by the way, in broadband, it's not dissimilar. Except that maybe it's not evolving as rapidly simply because it's a much more stable market, for instance, you hear about now 4K TVs video delivery to moving on to high definition, HD, and eventually moving even to 8K. That would be interesting to see how 8K is going to be accepted since the human eye may not even notice the difference, but people want it. And they want that, we're able to provide that. But it might take a bit longer, that's why I said broadband to us is a much -- we look at it as a much more stable gradually evolving market, even as OTT, the hype behind OTT and all that comes play which we participate in. But in data centers, it's serious stuff. More and more data are being basically pushed through pipes stored, processed as social media keeps expanding. And that's why we are seeing this past quarter and current quarter extraordinary strength in the demand for switching and routing. John Pitzer That's great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.

Our earnings press release dated April 5, 2017 can be found in the Investor Relations section of our Web-site at www.bedbathandbeyond.com. Here are some highlights. For the fourth quarter, net earnings per diluted share were $1.84. Net sales were approximately $3.5 billion, an increase of approximately 3.4% compared to the prior year period. Comparable sales increased approximately 0.4%, and comparable sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20% while sales from our stores declined in a low single-digit percentage range. For the full year, net earnings per diluted share were $4.58. Net sales were approximately $12.2 billion, an increase of approximately 0.9%. Comparable sales decreased approximately 0.6%, and comparable sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20% while sales from our stores declined in a low single-digit percentage range. In addition, our Board of Directors today declared an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share, from $0.125 per share, to be paid on July 18, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 16, 2017. During our call today, Sue will review our fourth quarter financial results and discuss some of our planning assumptions for fiscal 2017, and then Steven will give an update on some of the initiatives we are working on to position ourselves for long-term success. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to questions. I will now turn the call over to Sue. Susan E. Lattmann Thanks Janet. I'll start with a review of our fourth quarter results. Our net sales were approximately $3.5 billion, an increase of approximately 3.4% over last year, which is consistent with our model assumptions in December. This increase is primarily due to a 3% increase in non-comp sales including PMall, One Kings Lane and new stores and a 0.4% increase in comp sales. The increase in our comp sales reflects an increase in the average transaction amount, which was partially offset by a decrease in the number of transactions in stores. We believe in an integrated and seamless customer experience, and as we have explained previously, while we cannot tell you through which channel a sale was initiated, we can provide information based on where the sale was consummated. With that said, comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20% while comp sales from our stores declined in a low single-digit percentage range. Gross margin was approximately 38% as compared to approximately 38.6% in the prior year period. This decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, first, an increase in net direct to customer shipping expense as a result of more promotional shipping offer activity including a change in the Bed Bath & Beyond free shipping thresholds from $49 last year to $29 this year and free shipping for the first few days of the quarter which included Cyber Monday, and second, an increase in coupon expense resulting from increases in redemptions and the average coupon amount. The inclusion of One Kings Lane reduced total Company gross margin as a percentage of net sales by approximately 12 basis points while the inclusion of PMall contributed 19 basis points to the total Company gross margin. For the full year, the rate of gross margin deleverage was the same as 2015, which was consistent with our model. SG&A in the quarter was approximately 25.8% of net sales. This compares to 24% in the fourth quarter of last year which included a favorable net benefit of approximately 50 basis points from certain nonrecurring items. The remainder of the increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, an increase in advertising expenses and an increase in payroll and payroll related expenses. The inclusion of One Kings Lane and PMall increased total Company SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales by approximately 15 and 5 basis points respectively in the fourth quarter. Net interest expense was approximately $16.8 million compared to $24.5 million in the prior year period. This decrease in net interest expense was primarily the result of an $8 million favorable change in the value of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan investments, which was fully offset in SG&A and therefore did not impact net earnings. Our income tax rate was approximately 35% compared to approximately 36% in the prior year period. The fourth quarter provisions included favorable net after-tax benefit of approximately $9 million this year as compared to about $7 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during these quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $1.84. Moving onto the balance sheet, we ended the year with approximately $578 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $2.9 billion at cost, an increase of approximately 2.2% compared to the end of the prior year period. This increase was due in part to the growth in inventory in our distribution facilities for shipments to customers as well as the inventory balances from PMall and One Kings Lane. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. Capital expenditures for the year were approximately $374 million, with some of the anticipated spend for 2016 moving into 2017. CapEx for the year included the following; enhancements to our digital capabilities; ongoing investments in our data warehouse and data analytics; expenditures for the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including the implementation of our new POS system into some of our stores; investments in new systems and support to accelerate the expansion of our online assortment; the replatforming of One Kings Lane's systems and integration of its support services; spending related to the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas; the expansion of our customer contact center in Layton and enhancements to its systems; and investments in new stores, including the opening of BEYOND at Liberty View in Brooklyn, store relocations and store refurbishments. During the fourth quarter, we opened nine new stores and closed four stores. For the full year, we opened 29 and closed 13 stores. Our store openings during the year included new store formats such as BEYOND at Liberty View and the two new andThat! stores, plus additional Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY stores in Canada and new markets primarily for Cost Plus World Market and Harmon Face Values. Share repurchases under our current $2.5 billion share repurchase program were approximately $171 million in the fourth quarter, representing about 4.1 million shares. This authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $1.7 billion at the end of fiscal 2016. In addition, our Board of Directors today declared an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share, from $0.125 per share, to be paid on July 18, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 16, 2017. Regarding our outlook for fiscal 2017, which is a 53-week year, we are working off a set of assumptions as we do every year. Some of these assumptions are easier to model based upon our historical performance and current trends and some of these assumptions are more difficult to model due to variables such as timing and the sensitivity to the changing retail landscape. Then we have a number of things that are not included in our model but could impact our financial results this year, such as potential regulatory changes including corporate tax reform. So with that in mind, let's start with the assumptions that are easier to model given our historical performance and current trends. Taking into account the 53rd week in fiscal 2017, we are modeling a low to mid single-digit percentage increase in consolidated net sales for the full year. We are also modeling an increase in comparable sales. However, the range is from relatively flat to slightly positive, including continued strong growth in our customer-facing digital channels. We are modeling gross margin deleverage for 2017 including increases in net direct to customer shipping expense and coupon expense. We anticipate the 2017 rate of deleverage to be less than that of 2016. We are modeling SG&A deleverage as a result of payroll and payroll related expenses and technology expenses, including related depreciation as well as the impact from the current expense structures of One Kings Lane and PMall, both of which were acquired during fiscal 2016. We are modeling 2017 depreciation expense to be in the range of approximately $310 million to $320 million. We are modeling net interest expense of approximately $80 million for the full year. Capital expenditures are modelled to be relatively similar to fiscal 2016 subject to the timing and composition of projects. In December 2016, we said that we were modelling CapEx spend to be between $400 million and $425 million for fiscal 2016, and primarily due to the timing of our projects, we came in less than that at approximately $374 million. We believe for the foreseeable future that we are [indiscernible] at about these levels. In addition, more than half of the 2017 spend is planned for technology-related projects in support of our growing omnichannel capabilities. In fiscal 2017, we plan to open 30 new stores and close approximately 15 to 20 stores. We plan to open stores across all our concepts, including new formats and new markets. We expect our positive cash flow to fund our operations and capital expenditures as well as our quarterly dividends and share repurchase program. The completion of our current $2.5 billion authorization is planned for some time in fiscal 2020, subject to several factors including business and market conditions. Next let's move to the assumptions that are more difficult to model, such as various components of our tax rate. First, we anticipate that our tax rate will be higher as a result of the adoption of the new share-based payment accounting standard. The effect of this adoption on our tax rate is expected to vary by quarter and does not affect our cash outflows for income taxes. Second, even excluding the impact of this new accounting standard, we anticipate the net after-tax benefit from other distinct tax events will be lower than in 2016. Considering these assumptions, we are modeling our 2017 tax rate to be higher than last year but still within the mid to high 30 percentage range for the full year, with the first quarter being the highest for the year, slightly in excess of 40%, primarily due to the impact of the new accounting standard and the timing of the [indiscernible] investing schedules of our stock-based compensation. Finally, there are a number of events that we have not attempted to model but could impact our financial results this year, such as potential regulatory changes including corporate tax reform, interest expense deductibility, a potential border adjustment tax and healthcare reform. At this time, we don't have enough information regarding the timing and the scope of these potential events for us to make any reasonable assumptions. Based on the items that we have modelled, including a slight benefit from the 53rd week, the anticipated deleverage due to our continued investments and the higher anticipated tax rate, we are modeling a decline in net earnings per diluted share in the percentage range of low single digits to 10% for fiscal 2017. We believe our 2017 quarterly net earnings per diluted share will have a similar pro-rata percent to the total year as they have in the previous year, with the exception that the percent for the first quarter is anticipated to be somewhat lighter due in part to the adoption of the new share-based payment accounting standard and for the fourth quarter is anticipated to be somewhat stronger due in part to the slight benefit from the 53rd week. We look forward to giving you updates as the year progresses and as our visibility to the year improves. Before turning the call over to Steven, please note that our next quarterly conference call will take place on Thursday, June 22. At that time, we will review our first quarter results and provide an update on fiscal 2017. Steven? Steven H. Temares Thank you, Sue. During fiscal 2016, we made significant investments to evolve our Company and advance our mission to be trusted by our customers as the expert for the home and heart-related life events by continuing to build and deliver a strong foundation of differentiated products and services and solutions for our customers while driving operational excellence. As Janet said, we reported fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share of $4.58, which was consistent with our model. This marks the fifth year in a row that we've been in the earnings range of between $4.5 to just over $5 since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. It is important to note that while we are experiencing operating profit declines during this investment phase, we continued to produce some of the best returns in retail which allows us to make the investments necessary to build a strong foundation for future growth. We are excited about the advances we are making. Today I'll provide an update on some of the key developments over the past several months that are strengthening our competitive position as the expert for the home and heart-related life events. And by heart-related life events we mean certain life events that evoke strong emotional connections. These include the customer experience that we address through developing the best and largest wedding registry, our baby registry, our new mover programs, our college and camp businesses, as well as our developing design consultation services. Over time, these interactions allow us to cultivate deeper relationships and increase the lifetime value of our customers. I'll start with some recent examples of how we are doing this. As our footprint in the furniture and home decor category continues to expand and as we further our marketing efforts to create a more inspirational presentation of our offerings, we want to be able to provide more meaningful services and solutions to our customers who are making decorating decisions. In early March 2017, we acquired Decorist in a non-material cash transaction. Decorist is an online interior design platform that connects users to affordable, acceptable and personalized home design services. Through the Decorist platform, consumers and businesses can directly connect with bedded top-tier designers including nationally-renowned celebrity designers to collaboratively work through the design process. To increase customer confidence in purchasing furniture pieces, Decorist has developed and offers photorealistic 3-D renderings of how these items look in their actual homes. Decorist also offers additional online services, including a Design Bar advice tool which provides free expert design advice within 24 hours, inspirational boards, an editorial blog, designer tips and latest trends to further enhance customer engagements and develop deeper customer ties. While One Kings Lane and Cost Plus World Market had already partnered with Decorist to market and sell their furniture and home decor merchandise, we plan to add the growing home furnishing assortment from Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY to the mix. Through these relationships, Decorist also serves as another vehicle to showcase our expanding footprint in the furniture and home decor category. So, we look forward to supporting Decorist in its efforts to continue building brand awareness of their online business, increasing their revenue opportunities and developing their technology to further their leadership in the online interior design space. At the same time, as the interior design arm for Bed Bath & Beyond, we plan to leverage Decorist online platform to initiate and/or enhance our design consultation offerings for some of our concepts. In another example, as we focus on providing deeper and more personalized shopping experiences, we seek to strengthen our relationships with customers who are also cooking and baking enthusiasts. In January, we made a small acquisition of certain assets of Chef Central, including the brand and e-commerce Web-site. We also added knowledgeable and talented associates to our Company with great culinary retailing expertise. As a specialty retailer, Chef Central has been a trusted brand among cooking and baking enthusiasts for more than 15 years. We plan to leverage Chef Central's strength in merchandising and marketing to increase our ability to serve these customers. This includes leveraging their know-how and providing a more experiential omni-channel shopping environment in-store, including activities such as cooking classes and demonstrations. We anticipate continuing to support the Chef Central e-commerce Web-site and opening Chef Central inspired specialty departments within Bed Bath & Beyond stores and potentially freestanding stores. Our first Chef Central inspired specialty department is scheduled to open this fall in Paramus, New Jersey. These recent activities supplement the other investments we are making to develop a more deep-seated relationship with our customers, including those in One Kings Lane which serves as a cornerstone for our growing offerings in furniture, home decor and design, and in Personalization Mall which expands our personalization services and brings the complementary portfolio of differentiated products that help celebrate life events and special occasions. Collectively, these investments are furthering our ability to do more for and with our customers and advancing our position as the expert for the home and heart-related life events. These recent transactions also advance our ongoing efforts to delight our customers through our merchandising. Those of you who have followed us for years know that we are zealous about presenting an exciting and engaging assortment of products to our customers. Our ability to do this over the years has always been a differentiator for us, and today, product differentiation is more important than ever in keeping the interest of existing customers and attracting new ones. We pursue product differentiation in several ways, including our own product development and exclusivity and limited distribution with our vendor partners. For example, our product development team partnering with industry experts has recently introduced a new line of bed linens and bedding basics at Bed Bath & Beyond under our proprietary Wamsutta brand called Wamsutta PimaCott. PimaCott is made from 100% Pima cotton and is not only softer, more durable and more vibrant than regular cotton, but is also the first of its kind that can be tracked and traced throughout the supply chain using [VNA] [ph] technology. As a trusted expert for the home, it is important to us that our customers are confident that the products they purchase from us are truly 100% Pima cotton, and they can be by looking for the Wamsutta PimaCott label. We also plan to launch a line of Wamsutta PimaCott bath towels later this spring. Another example of our product development capabilities includes the launch of the One Kings Lane collection. This line of proprietary furniture and lighting debuted several months ago and has been well-received by customers. The One Kings Lane collection continues to grow and now includes a new line of outdoor furniture. Again, we believe the home furnishing space provides us a tremendous opportunity to build a large curated assortment of differentiated products to engage with our customers in a meaningful way and to provide inspiration across various lifestyles. Additionally, exclusive offerings further our efforts to differentiate our mix. For example, we have recently introduced the second edition of our ED Ellen DeGeneres Home Collection, which is available in most Bed Bath & Beyond stores and online. In addition to bedding and accessories, the assortment now includes kitchen linens, dinnerware and home decor including rugs. We are also excited to be one of the limited number of retailers authorized to sell an assortment of home furnishings for Magnolia Home designed by Joanna Gaines, the co-star of the home improvement show Fixer Upper. In partnership with our vendor, the Magnolia Home assortment includes a collection of rugs, pillows and throws that reflect Joanna's simple, fresh and timeless style. This collection is available online and in select Bed Bath & Beyond stores, including some of our Texas stores which showcase the whole collection in a Magnolia Home inspired department. We also continue to broaden our merchandise offerings for Linen Holdings, our institutional business, which consist of Harbor Linen and T-Y Group. Recently, Linen Holdings entered the hotel operational supplies and equipment segment, which basically covers many of the other items you can find in a hotel room besides the linens and towels. By leveraging our vast product network, Linen Holdings can now provide our hospitality customers with a one-stop shop to everything needed to fit-out a hotel room. Just as our merchandising has always been central to our success, at the very center has been our focus on serving our customers. While retailing continues to change introducing so many new ways to engage and interact, we continue to focus on providing a great customer experience across all our channels. For example, recent enhancements to our digital channels include improvements in search and navigation to enhance the relevancy of customer search results. We have enhanced the functionality of an existing search feature to make it easier for customers to search the Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY Web-sites to determine availability of products in their local stores. For our registry customers, we have recently launched an interactive checklist on these Web-sites which serves as a helpful guide throughout the online experience in providing a well-rounded giftable registry. This new tool complements the high-quality one-on-one registry service our in-store searches provide to our customers every day. An additional improvement to the customer experience is a new feature called Shop the Room, found under the Trends & Ideas tab on the Bed Bath & Beyond Web-site. This online guide contains a series of curated rooms for the living room, bedroom and bathroom that showcase an array of different design styles. The initial collections include at least five different lifestyle trends for the home. These collections are intended to engage and inspire customers as they think about their home decor options. Over the coming weeks, we are partnered to begin piloting a new service online that will connect our customers to quality professionals for home installation and other home improvement projects. As our assortment of home furnishings continues to grow, we remain committed to providing the services and solutions to excel in this category. Even with the right merchandise and the best services and solutions, we strive to communicate with our customers in increasingly meaningful ways. We have always used our marketing programs as a tool to forge these bonds but today our customer-centric marketing strategy is also supported by our enhanced analytics capabilities as we develop deeper relationships with our customers to personalize target marketing, including e-mail and direct mail campaigns. We are leveraging our improved predictive modeling tools to optimize our direct mail and print campaigns, including our newest seasonal home catalog titled Spring Refresh which was mailed a few weeks ago to a select group of customers and prospective customers. This new home catalog showcases our expertise of the home through a curated inspirational presentation of our expanded offerings, including within our home furnishings and decor categories. The virtual version of this catalog is also available online at bedbathandbeyond.com. As we evolve and grow our business, the opportunity to deliver best-in-class customer service across all our channels is greater than ever and we intend to do so. In furtherance of this objective, we are opening an additional customer contact center in Florida later this year that will supplement our other 24/7 operations in Utah, New Jersey and Massachusetts. As we work to differentiate our products and provide differentiated services and solutions to our customers, we also pursue operational excellence in everything we do. This includes continued enhancements to our supply chain network. For example, we plan to open a new 525,000 square foot distribution facility in Las Vegas during fiscal 2017. This new facility will replace a smaller fulfillment center in that area which will close in late 2017 and provide additional capacity to support the growth of our digital channels. We are also expanding our vendor direct to customer or VDC offerings into the Canadian market. In addition, we are piloting third-party app-based delivery services from some of our Cost Plus World Market stores. And later this month, we plan to begin a pilot for same-day delivery from certain Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY stores in several markets including Dallas, Houston and Washington, D.C. As we look back over this past year, we have made and continue to make significant investments in our Company to advance our core objective, to be trusted by our customers as the expert for the home and heart-related life events by continuing to build on the strong foundation of differentiated products and service and solutions for customers while driving operational excellence. By focusing on our mission and remaining grounded in a culture obsessed with satisfying our customers along with maintaining strong financial discipline, we will become the customers' first choice for the home and heart-related life events and continue to achieve long-term success. I would like to thank our nearly 65,000 associates, including our new team members from Decorist and Chef Central, for their ongoing dedication and commitment to achieving our strategic objectives and improving our competitive position. I'll now turn the call back to Janet. Janet M. Barth Thank you, Steven. We will now turn to the Q&A portion of our call. As usual, we would appreciate if you would please limit yourself to one question, with one follow-up. Adrienne, we are now ready to take questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Steven Forbes I realize it's early, but just maybe given the opportunity, how have the level [indiscernible] Shop the Home collections performed relative to expectations, and then how do you think about building brand awareness as the destination for furniture in general, and are you targeting your best customers first for this, any color about how you are approaching the marketing aspect and brand building aspect of that opportunity? Steven H. Temares I think it's early first of all to really seeing and the traffic isn't of the type that like you said I think it's nowhere and it's into build, and we really haven't done a real lot of marketing around it yet. And it's the same thing with the furniture and home decor offering. I mean first, we are working hard to get the offering in place and to get the offering right. There's a lot of growth that has to take place there. So we really haven't done significant marketing around it. You might have seen the books that we did and they went out to a limited audience. There was the book that went out in fall and the one that went out now in the spring, and it's a small segment of our population, and it's really a cross-section right now as we are trying to get the learnings from a cross-section of our customers. We have our customers segmented and this is a tool to enable us to learn about each of their patterns hopefully over time. So initially that's the way we approached it. Steven Forbes And then as a follow-up maybe expanding on recent learnings, can you touch on what you have gained so far from the Beyond+ beta test? I mean are you seeing improved traffic trends and maybe what channel is that customer migrating to and do you have insight right into whether or not you are actually gaining share of wallet with that membership program or loyalty program? Steven H. Temares Sure. Again, it's early. The results have been good basically across all the metrics that we are looking at. I think at this week or the end of this week we are planning on expanding the test group based upon those results. At the same time, there are things about it like really when we look at the lifetime value of the customer, we are very early into that lifetime analysis. So we really have to understand over time to what we are seeing, does it continue, the types of products that they migrate, our customer migrates to, how often they are shopping, the shipping expenses associated with it. So it's still early but everything so far has been favorable and we will be expanding the test later this week. Operator Our next question comes from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Seth Sigman My first question is on online growth. You've seen some really healthy growth, 20% plus, for some time now. Can you give us a sense of what's working well online, what are you learning from the expanded assortment that you have online now? And then, as it seems to be cannibalizing the store to some extent, is it causing you to rethink the store format at all, how many stores you have today and ultimately what the offering looks like in that store? Steven H. Temares Sure. We could start with the backend of the question about the store format. I mean, we have been evolving the store format and continue to evolve it. Years ago we started anticipating foot traffic declining, expense structure increasing with the wage structure. The writing is on the wall and it's only accelerated over time. So, it's the smaller stores, the combining of the different offerings, all these things were underway and we continued to do those things and we only have stores obviously to the extent they make sense and those stores are in a market that with those stores were more profitable than without those stores. And there are other benefits just besides the four-wall profitability of the store because we also look at the benefits that we get in the digital world and the fact that we are able to – we benefit from the fact that we have a presence in a market for reduced advertising expense, convenience for the customer to reserve online pickup in store, for people to start or schedule appointments and initiate registry services in stores for other people to shop online for them. So there are so many benefits that go both ways. And the idea that that's cannibalization, that's a tough one to say because whether we do it or somebody else does it, the movement is to digital. And so the fact that we are getting better at digital, that we are adding to our assortment, that we are improving our search, that we are improving our content, that we are improving the speed at the backend, if everything is improving with our site, that's great. The notion that it increases cannibalization is a tough one to really assess because, again, that customer is choosing to shop in a digital world, and if they didn't shop us, they would shop someplace else. Seth Sigman Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then my follow-up question, I guess just in the shorter term, as we think about the comp guidance for flat to slightly positive this year, any considerations as it relates to the cadence and maybe how you are trending early here in the first quarter? I think last year in the first quarter you had some headwinds related to the Memorial Day shift. I think there was an advertising shift as well. Should we assume that comps continue to improve here sequentially versus what we saw in the fourth quarter? Susan E. Lattmann Seth, we have provided the full your guidance as you mentioned of a comp increase of relatively flat to slightly positive, and that considers what we have seen to date through the first quarter. Other than that, we gave a full year range. Seth Sigman Okay. I think you talked about lower earnings growth potentially in the first quarter due to some other issues but does that have anything to do with the comp difference and assumption in Q1 versus the rest of the year? Steven H. Temares I was just going to say that I think the primary reason that we pointed out is the tax implications. Susan E. Lattmann We did for Q1 and the comp guidance is for the full year, but again, it considers what we have seen to date. But as Steve mentioned, it was really Q1, the lighter EPS modelling that we did was due in part to the tax rate change that we discussed. Seth Sigman Okay. Thanks very much. Operator Our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citi. Please go ahead. Kate McShane I wondered if we could get any more color on your shipping strategy, how you are thinking about some of the changes that you have made to the shipping fee, how you are thinking about free ship? And then what percentage of your customer can you get to within two days of your fulfillment center and stores? Steven H. Temares We have built out a distribution network to allow us to get second day delivery. I think it's well into the 90% of the U.S. population we'd be able to accomplish that. That's the strategy as far as the distribution, the location of the distribution centers. And then as well as you know that we have shipped from stores directly, so in every market we have the capability of shipping directly from our stores. As far as the strategy in the $29, I think we will be anniversarying, we've anniversaried the $29 and I think there is a little period of time where we blip and then we go back to the $49 from last year. But this year we have pretty much looked at it and modelled it at $29 for the year, and we think that that's – right now our assessment is that it's pretty much a sweet spot, but we are always looking at the competition. And obviously when we talk about shipping, we are talking about the Bed Bath shipping but each of the concepts have their own strategy and the tactics they use in connection with shipping, but if you are talking about Bed Bath, that's how we've modelled it out for $29 and we think that for the moment that seems to be where our customers – when we look at what our customer buys, the average purchase, particularly what they're buying, there seems to be a sweet spot for the moment. Kate McShane Okay, great. And then if I could just follow up on the CapEx spend, I think you mentioned half of it was going to technology. Is there any way to bucket what technology that it is going to and how it differs to what you spent in 2016? Susan E. Lattmann So for 2017, we did say that more than half would be allocated towards technology in terms of the growing omni-channel capabilities. So that would include our Web-site, our phone and mobile apps. It also includes supporting continued SKUs being added online. We also discussed our customer service center that we'll be opening in Florida and the technology around opening that facility. So some of that is the items that I would say were included from a technology perspective in CapEx for next year. Operator And our next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Lasser Steve, you've made some considerable operational expenditures and investments in the business over the last few years, yet you are still looking for sales to be flat or your comp sales to be flattish or slightly positive this year bringing income down by a meaningful amount. Do you think you are getting a suitable return on these investments, and if you are not, at what point do you slow the pace of investments and potentially look to contain costs? Steven H. Temares First of all, we are not going to cut ourselves to greatness, so that's again we can't say that strong enough. The investments we've been making have made us significantly better. Are we where we want to be? No. But where would we have been if we didn't make these investments is the question that we have to ask ourselves. The retail is littered with people who didn't invest enough or invested later and made the wrong decision. So that's not where we intend to be. So we do measure each of the things that we invest in, we have expectations for them, and we think that we are a much better company today than we were 18 months ago, that we were three years ago. But unfortunately, we could produce better earnings in a short term by cutting expenditures but we wouldn't be a better company and we would be setting ourselves up for failure, and what we want to do is set ourselves up for greatness and that's why these investments need to be made. Michael Lasser And how are you measuring that greatness? Does that greatness come with your operating margin stabilizing at some point or are you just looking to maximize and grow gross operating profit dollars? Steven H. Temares Again, it will be measured by our customers trusting us to be the expert for what we do, for the home related product and for these heart-related life events that we handle. So being the largest player of what we think is the best choice when it comes to bridal registry, when we look at our baby registry, when we look at our growing decorating business, when we look at our large back to college business, our large new mover business, our camp business, all these things and being the best at them and then being able to take these customers over time into analytics, know who our customer is, speak to them on a personalized basis and to be able to be more important to them and be their first choice, and that's something that's going to be [indiscernible] over time. I mean we cannot be and we won't be just a transactional merchandise and be meaningful, so we have to be trusted by our customers as an expert in this way and that's what we are focused on, and the things that we are doing in terms of the differentiated product, all these services and solutions that we offer our customer as we try to always keep an eye towards operational excellence, are the ways that we intend to deliver this for our customer and to accomplish our mission. Operator Our next question comes from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matt Fassler My first question Steve relates to the category expansion that you executed primarily online under the core Bed Bath & Beyond heading. Now that you are a year plus into that effort, how are you thinking about its success, and quantitatively is this one of the factors that's contributing to the outsized 20% plus e-commerce growth that you're seeing? Steven H. Temares Matt, the addition to the assortment is contributing to that. And keep in mind that much of that product is vendor direct. So this isn't product that we take into our system, that we don't handle, that we don't have the cost associated, we don't have the markdown risks. But yes, this is advantageous to us from a sales perspective. Ultimately, this has to be quoted in a way that it's meaningful to the customer, that we have the right content, we have the right features and facets, that it makes good sense for the customer that they think of us for these categories, we can market toward these categories, and we are ways away from being there, but just the additional assortment in and of itself we are benefiting from. Matt Fassler Thank you. And then my second and follow-up question is most likely for Sue. So you have a couple of acquisitions that you executed over the past year. I guess PMall is quite seasonal as we understand it. So can you talk about what the seasonal fluctuations in that business will do to revenue and earnings in 2017 until you cycle the deal? Susan E. Lattmann As you've noted, PMall is more seasonal from a holiday perspective. Each of the holidays throughout the year, it is a nice business to have. So with Christmas being a bit stronger and then the rest of the year there are holidays where PMall does do some volume. So that's all I could really say in terms of a seasonal perspective. Steven H. Temares Actually I guess we also gave the information on how it affected the fourth quarter, the impact it had on SG&A and the impact it had on our gross margin, and if that's a relatively strong time of the year, you could extrapolate from that as well. Eugene A. Castagna Yes, and we acquired Personalization Mall at the end of November. So the December numbers were in our last year fourth quarter. So we will anniversary those numbers in next year's fourth quarter. Operator Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Adrienne Yih My question is on the DTC and the direct piece of the business. Where is it as of the end of last year? And as you look out maybe three to four years from now, where do you think the penetration ultimately resides, the balance between DTC, e-comm and brick-and-mortar? Steven H. Temares You are talking about direct from vendors? Adrienne Yih Online. Sorry, online, online sales. Steven H. Temares I don't think we break down those numbers. That's first of all. But most of what we are adding online has been and will be VDC. So from that perspective, you can anticipate that the penetration from that part of the business will be growing. I'm not trying to be evasive, so if you want to ask that question again, I might have missed what you were trying to get at. We don't give the exact numbers. Adrienne Yih I guess let me ask it a different way. So this earnings cycle I would say this is the first time that we have heard the number sort of 40% to 50% of people's ultimate sales call it in the next three to five years coming from the online channel and 50% of it coming from brick-and-mortar, and it was the first time that I have heard that number kind of well, well north of 30%. And so it kind of begs the question, in three to five years if you're planning now and you're thinking about that, how you look at your real estate footprint and how you plan for that ultimate penetration, if that's even something that you philosophically think is going to happen? Is that a better way of asking it? Steven H. Temares I don't want to be judgmental. But I understood that better. No, but I think it's a good question. And just so for clarity, we didn't say 40% or 50% you're saying. That's an industry number you are hearing. Adrienne Yih Correct, and it's a first. Steven H. Temares And we do believe that – and we do see the movement to the digital world and I think it has been more aggressive than most people had anticipated, and that's I think accurate, not the 40% or 50%, I don't think we could predict what it will be. But we have been gearing our real estate in anticipation of there being less foot traffic and more expensive to run. And so when we look at doing a deal or redoing a deal, is that we look at over the term of the lease, and sometimes that might only have to be five years, seven years or 10 years to make sense, and we look at estimating or anticipating reduction in foot traffic of a number depending upon the market could be 5% to 10%, we look at increases in the wage rate by market, we know what's on the books and what's being discussed, so whether it's going to be ramping up to $10, $11, $12 or $15 and what numbers are going to be like to that of other people in our building that have to go up as well, and we model it out. And right now we are only looking to do the stores if over that time of that lease we see four-wall profitability and that it makes sense to have that store in the market and we'd be more profitable for having that store than not having that store, meaning if the business went to our other stores, where would we be. So we are downsizing stores and in some cases we are increasing the size and consolidating stores. But every store we do has to make sense from that economic perspective, and we started doing that years ago. So we are in a very good position. I wish that there was – I think that we would be perceived differently perhaps if we went to market and say, we are closing 100 stores or 200 stores, but it doesn't make sense. If it does make sense at some point, we will. These stores are profitable and they are more profitable, these markets are more profitable for having the stores than consolidating. That's the situation today and we make those decisions as we go forward. But I think you are right on both accounts, is that the digital world is ramping up and ramping up quickly and that the bricks-and-mortar world will suffer for it and there will be ramifications, and one of those ramifications will be reduced occupancy cost. And what happens if the occupancy cost gets reduced? Stores that don't make sense today, make sense down the road. And as somebody asked earlier, I don't know if it was Steve or somebody else, but the format is changing also over time as we are looking to add more experiential aspects to the store, give customers more reasons for being there, we are trying to with our Beyond store we are handling all the store orders, these online orders in the stores. So these additional services that we are trying to offer through the stores, the appointment scheduling that we have in the stores, like we said the reserving online, picking up in stores, so all this is a purpose of having them as well. But we are fortune because we don't have a prototype, we don't have a 30,000 or 40,000 square foot store, they don't have to be the same in every market. So we have 8,000 to 9,000 square foot stores and 120,000 square foot. So we size them by market and we make economic sense by market and that's how we try to run the business intelligently and optimize our bottom line. Adrienne Yih That's very helpful. Thank you very much for that detail. Operator Our next question comes from Oliver Wintermantel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Oliver Wintermantel In today's multichannel world and where pricing becomes more competitive and sales shift online, so how do you think about your historic like more on the coupon side, how do you think that works in a more promotional and more online world with the coupon? Steven H. Temares The coupons are available to our customers online. At the same time, differentiated product is critical for us. We don't want to be, we've never wanted to be all about price and we have always been driven by merchandising. It's a critical differentiator for us and it needs to be going forward and more so than ever, so differentiated product is important. But the coupon is important. It's the value that we give to our customers. So being at the right price is something that we are focused on, that we crawl the Web, we look at our competitors and we have a pricing group that we are doing dynamic pricing today. So, all these things are in place to make sure that we are at the right price. But differentiated predict and then also to the degree that most items with a plug and a lot of our product is maintained by manufacturers, the pricing. So that's generally at the same price in the marketplace. So it's a significant focus for us, and over time as we have always said, we want to get to being more specific with the customer, understanding what drives their shopping pattern and what's the value to them and make sure we are speaking to them and that the value that we offer to them makes sense other than a general coupon. But we are not getting rid of the coupon, we understand how important it is and the value of it is. But we do need to migrate over time as we get more personalized with our shopper to understand what categories they shop, what they bought, what they are looking for, where they are and their buying patterns, and make sure that we are dealing with them accordingly. Oliver Wintermantel Got it. Thank you. And just a follow up on online sales, can you give us maybe, now that you have reduced your free shipping level to $29, how much of your product is shipping for free today with $29 versus $49? Steven H. Temares You're talking about just for the Bed Bath situation? So, I don't think we share that information, okay. We do know and we look at the shipping revenue and as we test things where we need to be to make sense of moving that threshold. But we do, like I said early on, it does appear to be a sweet spot for us when you look at what the average purchase is and what people are doing online. And when we have tested otherwise, right now that's absent competitive forces, that's where we anticipate being for now based upon that due diligence that we have done. Operator And our next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel So the first question I wanted to ask, I guess somewhat of a modelling question, maybe longer-term, so gross margins now have been under pressure for a while, down I think 20 plus quarters or so, and if I heard you correctly, in the guidance you talked about maybe a somewhat better trajectory in next year but it is still down. So as we think longer term, we recognize you don't give longer-term guidance, but just conceptually, is there a point at which given all that's going on we should see margins flatten out or even start to turn positive again, and for that to happen, what factors would have to come into play? Susan E. Lattmann The gross margin deleverage that we modelled for 2017, that rate we did model to be less than that of 2016. In terms of future modelling beyond that, we didn't share that, but in general there's many factors that would impact gross margin. For example, it's something Steve just discussed here, it's the free shipping thresholds. It's also I guess what I would say is margin in terms of mix of goods and products that are sold. It's also I would say including freight cost and whatnot. It would also depend on what folks are buying and that mix of product that they chose. So given all that and those many factors, it's not possible to say this is exactly when we would see no deleverage in the future. Those are the items that we watch and we look at, and obviously that's what we are striving towards. Brian Nagel Great, that's helpful. Then a follow-up question, maybe hopefully [indiscernible], with regards to online sales, so as evidenced by the pretty substantial growth you've had online, you guys are succeeding online, but I guess the question I have is, and I know there is an easy answer to this, who are you competing with online? I mean is it just Amazon or are there other companies playing in your space that you are competing with? And as you look at that competitive landscape right now, maybe Bed Bath & Beyond has been late to the online game, so if there are companies who are performing better, perhaps your markets are better [indiscernible], isn't it just a [indiscernible] mission amongst consumers because they were there earlier or is there some factor you think that play [indiscernible] what are the reasons the other companies are performing better online? Steven H. Temares I could think that online the truth is that we compete against many more people, that there are people that look for credible retailers, but a lot of people are searching for items or they are looking for inspiration in the furniture and decor area, and whomever shows up could be redeemed credible. And so there is a lot more competition online than there was in the four walls. So I think that's the reality. And when you say that there are things that you could do to increase your market share, and we do some of that obviously that are rational for us, but there are things that you could do that a little less rational, you could spend a lot more on your advertising to buy sales. I mean we have competitors that do that and that's part of the way that they choose to do business. So ultimately, we believe that having the right assortment, having best in class Web-site in terms of search, content, assortment to services that are attached to it, that combined with the omni-channel experience is a winning formula. But that short-term decision whether you are looking every day, your ad to sales ratio on your advertising for your online is something that you could play with on a daily basis, and you can for short-term periods, you can buy sales but at the expense of the bottom line. And then you have to ask yourself, what's the stickiness of that customer, the lifetime value of the customer, you make a lot of assumptions and you test into it and you look back on to see if you were right or wrong. But the idea about the whole thing about market share is a tough one because when we look at us for example coming out of the fourth quarter, I guess there was a number of our competitors who are all great competitors, the William Sonomas, the Targets, the Macy's, the Kohl's, the Restorations, all these people had not great quarters. And so, are we gaining market share, they are losing market share or the people shop a little bit less in our category and so maybe the whole market share, the whole market was a little bit lower. We don't have finite numbers to know those answers, but clearly our digital space is growing at a rapid pace and we believe we are gaining market share. We think that we are experiencing in our stores is similar or perhaps slightly better than what we see happening in the general retail marketplace. So if those are correct conclusions, we would say that perhaps we are picking up market share, but we are not satisfied and it's very negligible one way or the other to really understand if that's the case. Does that answer the question, Brian? Okay. Operator Our next question comes from Dan Binder from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst This is [indiscernible] on for Dan. In light of all the retail store closures that are coming this year, several of these retailers compete in categories that overlap categories that you compete in. So given this, how do you assess the promotional environment that you see over the year and are there any particular quarters where you anticipate a little bit more gross margin pressure from heightened promotional activity? Steven H. Temares I don't think that we will know that. In fact I think that we didn't see necessarily or know exactly when Linens-N-Things are in 3-D or [Strauss] [ph] or [indiscernible] or Home Express or Pacific Linens or JCPenney Home Stores, [indiscernible] people were closing stores. We didn't know that Macy's was going to close those stores or that Penney was closing those stores or what's going to happen with Sears and Kmart. So we really can't tell you or predict a particular point in time that the competitive landscape shifts. But when it shifts, we anticipate that in the short-term there is some pain and in the long-term there is benefit. Operator Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simeon Gutman First question just on guidance, just two quick parts, the comp guidance, little flatfish to slightly positive for next year, can you just [indiscernible] what's the confidence? I know it's a slight improvement. Looks like home furnishing retail sales are a little weaker than they were let's say 12 months ago. And then Sue, can you tell us about what's the embedded EBIT margin in the guidance or a range? Susan E. Lattmann Okay, so starting with the comp guidance, we are coming off of a Q4 which was a positive 0.4 comp. I think Steve discussed some of the initiatives, whether it's furniture initiatives, personalization initiatives becoming more inspirational. Those are things we are working on throughout the year. And coming off that positive 0.4 comp, that's our model, that's where we see for now for modeling purposes and we will update it as the year progresses. Your second question I believe was on EBIT margin? Simeon Gutman Correct, yes. If you could just share what's the implied range within the EPS guidance? Steven H. Temares I don't think we provided that. We did say that the tax rate would be higher in 2017 than it was in 2016. Susan E. Lattmann We did. Steven H. Temares Interest should be relatively flat year-over-year, at least we believe it will be. So I guess the EBIT range would be slightly better than the EPS range on a per share basis, but we didn't give details about that. Simeon Gutman Okay. And my follow-up, if you look at back at 2016, could you have accelerated some of the investments, therefore that leaves some less to do in 2017, and then thinking about 2017, realize this may be a never evolving answer, but you've probably been asked multiple times, does this year represent the peak investment period, et cetera? Again, it's evolving, but any sense on that, can you answer that with clarity at this point? Susan E. Lattmann We provided our model which is around $400 million to $425 million. We came in at around $374 million for 2016. And so if you go back and you look historically, that's a peak for us at $374 million and we see that plateauing in that range of the model and where we ended up certainly for 2017. A CapEx model is fluid. Things happen throughout the year. Sometimes we are accelerating certain projects that we didn't originally plan and sometimes due to sequential basis we are pushing projects out. And then sometimes there are projects that we didn't even initially planned that we end up partway through the year make sense, whether it's for strategic reasons or financial reasons. So, we make those decisions as we go and that's our best model estimate at this time. Operator Our next question comes from Brad Thomas from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Bradley Thomas One of the things the Company has done very well over the years is to take products from teams that it has acquired like Harmon and buybuy BABY and integrated into the core Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Could you maybe talk about what inning you are in with Harmon and buybuy BABY products and some of the other ones, and what role, if any, you see for some of the online brands to have a presence in the Bed Bath & Beyond stores? Steven H. Temares I think that you could look at the Web-site to see the numbers of Harmon, where the health and beauty care, the four departments, I think it's a couple of hundred I think is the number there. I'm not giving any trade secrets. So I think there is an opportunity as we go forward for that. I think the buybuy BABY departments in the store are very few relative to that even. And so all those are opportunities to do more of this as we rollover real estate opportunities, because when we opened up those stores they weren't sized for those additional departments and things that we have in the store are very productive and obviously Harmon is commodity goods and Baby margins are in Bed Bath margin. So that's things that will evolve over time and the cost of the real estate and all those things will play into what the stores look like going forward. As far as the other online brands, I mean when we look at for example the PMall and the opportunity for them to create personalized product, we talked about them being seasonal and the opportunity for them to use all their processes and to provide product to Bed Bath & Beyond for example, that's a significant opportunity for us. So that's something that we are all working on so that we do see and we were growing personalized products in our stores. Again, that's another differentiator for us, so we think that's important. When you talk about somebody like a Decorist, we've looked at the ability to provide additional services, decorating services within stores. One Kings Lane had the studio in San Francisco, a studio in New York, and that's part of their – and they just opened up something that's a hybrid situation in Connecticut which we think was very interesting. So the ability to provide that decorating service in some of the Bed Bath & Beyond stores is an opportunity. When you look at the fact that we are growing furniture and home decor online, the ability to take some of that furniture, whether it would be One Kings Lane or other furniture offerings can show it to some degree in a way in our stores so customers understand that we are in the furniture business, so that's a growing opportunity for us as well. But in each of these areas is that we do have to figure out the right points of integration so the customer understands that we have the product that they are looking for, for the entire home and that we can be trusted as the expert for the home. So these are all things that are being done, some are further along than others and the ones that you pointed to, Harmon is further along, and Baby, we have certain departments in certain parts of the country that take advantage of the Christmas Tree Shops seasonal merchandise because they do such a wonderful job at seasonal. So you could find that in Bed Bath & Beyond stores. So all of this is something that very much continues to be a work in progress, but over time I think you will see more of it and we'll leverage it to a greater degree. Bradley Thomas Great. Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from Laura Champine from Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead. Laura Champine When you talk about adding more furniture into your stores, what do you move out to make room for that, or is this new assortment just going in into expanded and remodelled stores? Steven H. Temares Obviously again you are talking about Bed Bath, because in furniture already you could find furniture at Cost Plus, you could find furniture at the Baby, obviously it's a significant and important part of the Baby assortment. That Christmas Tree sells furniture in Bed Bath, sells certain furniture. But again, there is different thought process and different things that we've been testing. But if you even take a look, I don't know if you have had an opportunity to see the studio experience at One Kings Lane, in a small amount of space you could really explain to the customer that you're in this business. So you might not necessarily sell much out of the store or carry much in the store, but you can really show the customer that we are in these businesses, we stand for these businesses, and explain that they can find it online, because even when you go into a Restoration, their offering is limited relative to you find somebody walking around with a tablet and they show you the breadth of the assortment. So really the key is, we don't expect, and we are not saying that we're going to be a furniture store, but how do we get across to the customer that we are in the furniture business and the stores don't become a disadvantage where people say or think you're not in the furniture business because we don't show it at all and the store explains to the customer that we are in the business. Laura Champine Got it. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Budd Bugatch from Raymond James. Please go ahead. David This is David on for Budd. Thank you for taking my question. Steven, I wanted to follow up with the answer you were just giving. So in terms of making customers aware of all the product lines and businesses that Bed Bath & Beyond stands for, what do you see going forward as you having to do to achieve that goal? Is it spending more in advertising, is it leveraging the customer less and doing more targeted marketing? How do you think about it and what does it mean for some of the operating expenses and capital expenditures going forward? Steven H. Temares For the first place obviously is that you could address it in our stores, that if the people, if our customers coming to the stores understood that we had an expanded assortment, that would be wonderful. So there is a lot of ways to do that that are not big capital expenditures. And then what we do already, and there is a shift in what we do, so there is a shift in where we spend our dollars and how we spend the dollars. So how do you – what are in your e-mail campaigns, what are in your CRM programs, what are you doing with your catalogs, what are you showing, how much are you showing and how you are describing to the customers. So, a great deal of it could be achieved through a shift. And then obviously it's spending more to the degree that it drives the returns we're looking for, that would be wonderful as well. So there is a lot of things that can be done. So really we haven't even addressed the customers that walk into our stores and really have done a sufficient job of letting that customer know the categories we are growing, and again, we haven't been in a rush to do that because we don't believe in many categories we are at the point that we are rushing to get the customer there because we are presenting the merchandise in a way with content and features and facets and shopability in a way that makes it best in class. So as we go down the road of shoring rooms and being inspirational and showing having the photography right and having the content right and having the chat up to speed so that we can answer the questions, and having our vendors up to speed so they could deliver appropriately and that we could deliver to people's homes with White Glove delivery and we could deliver out of our stores with the third-party partners who could pick it up and deliver it for the customers, and so all these things are more in place. We are not in a rush to show the customer we do something not great. So when we do things, we get to the point where we think that we're doing it well enough or great. The last part and the easy part will be marketing to the customer. David Okay. And then to follow, the logical follow-up to that is, when do you think most of those things will be in place? Steven H. Temares It's a gamut, because for example like even the delivery, the delivery network, to get delivery right we signed at this very local to take the last mile on delivery, and that if somebody is delivering the sofa versus delivering a mirror, that there is going to be in a lot of cases different delivery service. So again, everything that we are doing has a different timeline and it's not as if we are going to wait for everything to be perfect before we start taking particular categories and shouting that we are in this business. But literally, if you go online today and you take a look at some of the categories, you look literally at how we show it or how easily it's shopped or shopable, there are things that we have a lot to be desired. You shouldn't be when you are looking at it for upholstery or you are looking for sizes or you are looking for certain looks or feels, again, it should be easy for the customer and we need to really to make sure that we are attributing product correctly, that we are showing it in a way that we are really resonating with the customer in being able to do certain things in an inspirational way, so that it's close to best-in-class at least as we try to get and will get to best-in-class. So, each of these things has a different timeline. David Okay. Thank you. Operator I would now turn the call back over to Janet Barth for closing remarks. Janet M. Barth Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to having you join us again on our next quarterly earnings call on June 22nd. Have a good evening. Operator Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Steven Forbes I realize it's early, but just maybe given the opportunity, how have the level [indiscernible] Shop the Home collections performed relative to expectations, and then how do you think about building brand awareness as the destination for furniture in general, and are you targeting your best customers first for this, any color about how you are approaching the marketing aspect and brand building aspect of that opportunity? Steven H. Temares I think it's early first of all to really seeing and the traffic isn't of the type that like you said I think it's nowhere and it's into build, and we really haven't done a real lot of marketing around it yet. And it's the same thing with the furniture and home decor offering. I mean first, we are working hard to get the offering in place and to get the offering right. There's a lot of growth that has to take place there. So we really haven't done significant marketing around it. You might have seen the books that we did and they went out to a limited audience. There was the book that went out in fall and the one that went out now in the spring, and it's a small segment of our population, and it's really a cross-section right now as we are trying to get the learnings from a cross-section of our customers. We have our customers segmented and this is a tool to enable us to learn about each of their patterns hopefully over time. So initially that's the way we approached it. Steven Forbes And then as a follow-up maybe expanding on recent learnings, can you touch on what you have gained so far from the Beyond+ beta test? I mean are you seeing improved traffic trends and maybe what channel is that customer migrating to and do you have insight right into whether or not you are actually gaining share of wallet with that membership program or loyalty program? Steven H. Temares Sure. Again, it's early. The results have been good basically across all the metrics that we are looking at. I think at this week or the end of this week we are planning on expanding the test group based upon those results. At the same time, there are things about it like really when we look at the lifetime value of the customer, we are very early into that lifetime analysis. So we really have to understand over time to what we are seeing, does it continue, the types of products that they migrate, our customer migrates to, how often they are shopping, the shipping expenses associated with it. So it's still early but everything so far has been favorable and we will be expanding the test later this week. Operator Our next question comes from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Seth Sigman My first question is on online growth. You've seen some really healthy growth, 20% plus, for some time now. Can you give us a sense of what's working well online, what are you learning from the expanded assortment that you have online now? And then, as it seems to be cannibalizing the store to some extent, is it causing you to rethink the store format at all, how many stores you have today and ultimately what the offering looks like in that store? Steven H. Temares Sure. We could start with the backend of the question about the store format. I mean, we have been evolving the store format and continue to evolve it. Years ago we started anticipating foot traffic declining, expense structure increasing with the wage structure. The writing is on the wall and it's only accelerated over time. So, it's the smaller stores, the combining of the different offerings, all these things were underway and we continued to do those things and we only have stores obviously to the extent they make sense and those stores are in a market that with those stores were more profitable than without those stores. And there are other benefits just besides the four-wall profitability of the store because we also look at the benefits that we get in the digital world and the fact that we are able to – we benefit from the fact that we have a presence in a market for reduced advertising expense, convenience for the customer to reserve online pickup in store, for people to start or schedule appointments and initiate registry services in stores for other people to shop online for them. So there are so many benefits that go both ways. And the idea that that's cannibalization, that's a tough one to say because whether we do it or somebody else does it, the movement is to digital. And so the fact that we are getting better at digital, that we are adding to our assortment, that we are improving our search, that we are improving our content, that we are improving the speed at the backend, if everything is improving with our site, that's great. The notion that it increases cannibalization is a tough one to really assess because, again, that customer is choosing to shop in a digital world, and if they didn't shop us, they would shop someplace else. Seth Sigman Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then my follow-up question, I guess just in the shorter term, as we think about the comp guidance for flat to slightly positive this year, any considerations as it relates to the cadence and maybe how you are trending early here in the first quarter? I think last year in the first quarter you had some headwinds related to the Memorial Day shift. I think there was an advertising shift as well. Should we assume that comps continue to improve here sequentially versus what we saw in the fourth quarter? Susan E. Lattmann Seth, we have provided the full your guidance as you mentioned of a comp increase of relatively flat to slightly positive, and that considers what we have seen to date through the first quarter. Other than that, we gave a full year range. Seth Sigman Okay. I think you talked about lower earnings growth potentially in the first quarter due to some other issues but does that have anything to do with the comp difference and assumption in Q1 versus the rest of the year? Steven H. Temares I was just going to say that I think the primary reason that we pointed out is the tax implications. Susan E. Lattmann We did for Q1 and the comp guidance is for the full year, but again, it considers what we have seen to date. But as Steve mentioned, it was really Q1, the lighter EPS modelling that we did was due in part to the tax rate change that we discussed. Seth Sigman Okay. Thanks very much. Operator Our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citi. Please go ahead. Kate McShane I wondered if we could get any more color on your shipping strategy, how you are thinking about some of the changes that you have made to the shipping fee, how you are thinking about free ship? And then what percentage of your customer can you get to within two days of your fulfillment center and stores? Steven H. Temares We have built out a distribution network to allow us to get second day delivery. I think it's well into the 90% of the U.S. population we'd be able to accomplish that. That's the strategy as far as the distribution, the location of the distribution centers. And then as well as you know that we have shipped from stores directly, so in every market we have the capability of shipping directly from our stores. As far as the strategy in the $29, I think we will be anniversarying, we've anniversaried the $29 and I think there is a little period of time where we blip and then we go back to the $49 from last year. But this year we have pretty much looked at it and modelled it at $29 for the year, and we think that that's – right now our assessment is that it's pretty much a sweet spot, but we are always looking at the competition. And obviously when we talk about shipping, we are talking about the Bed Bath shipping but each of the concepts have their own strategy and the tactics they use in connection with shipping, but if you are talking about Bed Bath, that's how we've modelled it out for $29 and we think that for the moment that seems to be where our customers – when we look at what our customer buys, the average purchase, particularly what they're buying, there seems to be a sweet spot for the moment. Kate McShane Okay, great. And then if I could just follow up on the CapEx spend, I think you mentioned half of it was going to technology. Is there any way to bucket what technology that it is going to and how it differs to what you spent in 2016? Susan E. Lattmann So for 2017, we did say that more than half would be allocated towards technology in terms of the growing omni-channel capabilities. So that would include our Web-site, our phone and mobile apps. It also includes supporting continued SKUs being added online. We also discussed our customer service center that we'll be opening in Florida and the technology around opening that facility. So some of that is the items that I would say were included from a technology perspective in CapEx for next year. Operator And our next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Lasser Steve, you've made some considerable operational expenditures and investments in the business over the last few years, yet you are still looking for sales to be flat or your comp sales to be flattish or slightly positive this year bringing income down by a meaningful amount. Do you think you are getting a suitable return on these investments, and if you are not, at what point do you slow the pace of investments and potentially look to contain costs? Steven H. Temares First of all, we are not going to cut ourselves to greatness, so that's again we can't say that strong enough. The investments we've been making have made us significantly better. Are we where we want to be? No. But where would we have been if we didn't make these investments is the question that we have to ask ourselves. The retail is littered with people who didn't invest enough or invested later and made the wrong decision. So that's not where we intend to be. So we do measure each of the things that we invest in, we have expectations for them, and we think that we are a much better company today than we were 18 months ago, that we were three years ago. But unfortunately, we could produce better earnings in a short term by cutting expenditures but we wouldn't be a better company and we would be setting ourselves up for failure, and what we want to do is set ourselves up for greatness and that's why these investments need to be made. Michael Lasser And how are you measuring that greatness? Does that greatness come with your operating margin stabilizing at some point or are you just looking to maximize and grow gross operating profit dollars? Steven H. Temares Again, it will be measured by our customers trusting us to be the expert for what we do, for the home related product and for these heart-related life events that we handle. So being the largest player of what we think is the best choice when it comes to bridal registry, when we look at our baby registry, when we look at our growing decorating business, when we look at our large back to college business, our large new mover business, our camp business, all these things and being the best at them and then being able to take these customers over time into analytics, know who our customer is, speak to them on a personalized basis and to be able to be more important to them and be their first choice, and that's something that's going to be [indiscernible] over time. I mean we cannot be and we won't be just a transactional merchandise and be meaningful, so we have to be trusted by our customers as an expert in this way and that's what we are focused on, and the things that we are doing in terms of the differentiated product, all these services and solutions that we offer our customer as we try to always keep an eye towards operational excellence, are the ways that we intend to deliver this for our customer and to accomplish our mission. Operator Our next question comes from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matt Fassler My first question Steve relates to the category expansion that you executed primarily online under the core Bed Bath & Beyond heading. Now that you are a year plus into that effort, how are you thinking about its success, and quantitatively is this one of the factors that's contributing to the outsized 20% plus e-commerce growth that you're seeing? Steven H. Temares Matt, the addition to the assortment is contributing to that. And keep in mind that much of that product is vendor direct. So this isn't product that we take into our system, that we don't handle, that we don't have the cost associated, we don't have the markdown risks. But yes, this is advantageous to us from a sales perspective. Ultimately, this has to be quoted in a way that it's meaningful to the customer, that we have the right content, we have the right features and facets, that it makes good sense for the customer that they think of us for these categories, we can market toward these categories, and we are ways away from being there, but just the additional assortment in and of itself we are benefiting from. Matt Fassler Thank you. And then my second and follow-up question is most likely for Sue. So you have a couple of acquisitions that you executed over the past year. I guess PMall is quite seasonal as we understand it. So can you talk about what the seasonal fluctuations in that business will do to revenue and earnings in 2017 until you cycle the deal? Susan E. Lattmann As you've noted, PMall is more seasonal from a holiday perspective. Each of the holidays throughout the year, it is a nice business to have. So with Christmas being a bit stronger and then the rest of the year there are holidays where PMall does do some volume. So that's all I could really say in terms of a seasonal perspective. Steven H. Temares Actually I guess we also gave the information on how it affected the fourth quarter, the impact it had on SG&A and the impact it had on our gross margin, and if that's a relatively strong time of the year, you could extrapolate from that as well. Eugene A. Castagna Yes, and we acquired Personalization Mall at the end of November. So the December numbers were in our last year fourth quarter. So we will anniversary those numbers in next year's fourth quarter. Operator Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Adrienne Yih My question is on the DTC and the direct piece of the business. Where is it as of the end of last year? And as you look out maybe three to four years from now, where do you think the penetration ultimately resides, the balance between DTC, e-comm and brick-and-mortar? Steven H. Temares You are talking about direct from vendors? Adrienne Yih Online. Sorry, online, online sales. Steven H. Temares I don't think we break down those numbers. That's first of all. But most of what we are adding online has been and will be VDC. So from that perspective, you can anticipate that the penetration from that part of the business will be growing. I'm not trying to be evasive, so if you want to ask that question again, I might have missed what you were trying to get at. We don't give the exact numbers. Adrienne Yih I guess let me ask it a different way. So this earnings cycle I would say this is the first time that we have heard the number sort of 40% to 50% of people's ultimate sales call it in the next three to five years coming from the online channel and 50% of it coming from brick-and-mortar, and it was the first time that I have heard that number kind of well, well north of 30%. And so it kind of begs the question, in three to five years if you're planning now and you're thinking about that, how you look at your real estate footprint and how you plan for that ultimate penetration, if that's even something that you philosophically think is going to happen? Is that a better way of asking it? Steven H. Temares I don't want to be judgmental. But I understood that better. No, but I think it's a good question. And just so for clarity, we didn't say 40% or 50% you're saying. That's an industry number you are hearing. Adrienne Yih Correct, and it's a first. Steven H. Temares And we do believe that – and we do see the movement to the digital world and I think it has been more aggressive than most people had anticipated, and that's I think accurate, not the 40% or 50%, I don't think we could predict what it will be. But we have been gearing our real estate in anticipation of there being less foot traffic and more expensive to run. And so when we look at doing a deal or redoing a deal, is that we look at over the term of the lease, and sometimes that might only have to be five years, seven years or 10 years to make sense, and we look at estimating or anticipating reduction in foot traffic of a number depending upon the market could be 5% to 10%, we look at increases in the wage rate by market, we know what's on the books and what's being discussed, so whether it's going to be ramping up to $10, $11, $12 or $15 and what numbers are going to be like to that of other people in our building that have to go up as well, and we model it out. And right now we are only looking to do the stores if over that time of that lease we see four-wall profitability and that it makes sense to have that store in the market and we'd be more profitable for having that store than not having that store, meaning if the business went to our other stores, where would we be. So we are downsizing stores and in some cases we are increasing the size and consolidating stores. But every store we do has to make sense from that economic perspective, and we started doing that years ago. So we are in a very good position. I wish that there was – I think that we would be perceived differently perhaps if we went to market and say, we are closing 100 stores or 200 stores, but it doesn't make sense. If it does make sense at some point, we will. These stores are profitable and they are more profitable, these markets are more profitable for having the stores than consolidating. That's the situation today and we make those decisions as we go forward. But I think you are right on both accounts, is that the digital world is ramping up and ramping up quickly and that the bricks-and-mortar world will suffer for it and there will be ramifications, and one of those ramifications will be reduced occupancy cost. And what happens if the occupancy cost gets reduced? Stores that don't make sense today, make sense down the road. And as somebody asked earlier, I don't know if it was Steve or somebody else, but the format is changing also over time as we are looking to add more experiential aspects to the store, give customers more reasons for being there, we are trying to with our Beyond store we are handling all the store orders, these online orders in the stores. So these additional services that we are trying to offer through the stores, the appointment scheduling that we have in the stores, like we said the reserving online, picking up in stores, so all this is a purpose of having them as well. But we are fortune because we don't have a prototype, we don't have a 30,000 or 40,000 square foot store, they don't have to be the same in every market. So we have 8,000 to 9,000 square foot stores and 120,000 square foot. So we size them by market and we make economic sense by market and that's how we try to run the business intelligently and optimize our bottom line. Adrienne Yih That's very helpful. Thank you very much for that detail. Operator Our next question comes from Oliver Wintermantel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Oliver Wintermantel In today's multichannel world and where pricing becomes more competitive and sales shift online, so how do you think about your historic like more on the coupon side, how do you think that works in a more promotional and more online world with the coupon? Steven H. Temares The coupons are available to our customers online. At the same time, differentiated product is critical for us. We don't want to be, we've never wanted to be all about price and we have always been driven by merchandising. It's a critical differentiator for us and it needs to be going forward and more so than ever, so differentiated product is important. But the coupon is important. It's the value that we give to our customers. So being at the right price is something that we are focused on, that we crawl the Web, we look at our competitors and we have a pricing group that we are doing dynamic pricing today. So, all these things are in place to make sure that we are at the right price. But differentiated predict and then also to the degree that most items with a plug and a lot of our product is maintained by manufacturers, the pricing. So that's generally at the same price in the marketplace. So it's a significant focus for us, and over time as we have always said, we want to get to being more specific with the customer, understanding what drives their shopping pattern and what's the value to them and make sure we are speaking to them and that the value that we offer to them makes sense other than a general coupon. But we are not getting rid of the coupon, we understand how important it is and the value of it is. But we do need to migrate over time as we get more personalized with our shopper to understand what categories they shop, what they bought, what they are looking for, where they are and their buying patterns, and make sure that we are dealing with them accordingly. Oliver Wintermantel Got it. Thank you. And just a follow up on online sales, can you give us maybe, now that you have reduced your free shipping level to $29, how much of your product is shipping for free today with $29 versus $49? Steven H. Temares You're talking about just for the Bed Bath situation? So, I don't think we share that information, okay. We do know and we look at the shipping revenue and as we test things where we need to be to make sense of moving that threshold. But we do, like I said early on, it does appear to be a sweet spot for us when you look at what the average purchase is and what people are doing online. And when we have tested otherwise, right now that's absent competitive forces, that's where we anticipate being for now based upon that due diligence that we have done. Operator And our next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel So the first question I wanted to ask, I guess somewhat of a modelling question, maybe longer-term, so gross margins now have been under pressure for a while, down I think 20 plus quarters or so, and if I heard you correctly, in the guidance you talked about maybe a somewhat better trajectory in next year but it is still down. So as we think longer term, we recognize you don't give longer-term guidance, but just conceptually, is there a point at which given all that's going on we should see margins flatten out or even start to turn positive again, and for that to happen, what factors would have to come into play? Susan E. Lattmann The gross margin deleverage that we modelled for 2017, that rate we did model to be less than that of 2016. In terms of future modelling beyond that, we didn't share that, but in general there's many factors that would impact gross margin. For example, it's something Steve just discussed here, it's the free shipping thresholds. It's also I guess what I would say is margin in terms of mix of goods and products that are sold. It's also I would say including freight cost and whatnot. It would also depend on what folks are buying and that mix of product that they chose. So given all that and those many factors, it's not possible to say this is exactly when we would see no deleverage in the future. Those are the items that we watch and we look at, and obviously that's what we are striving towards. Brian Nagel Great, that's helpful. Then a follow-up question, maybe hopefully [indiscernible], with regards to online sales, so as evidenced by the pretty substantial growth you've had online, you guys are succeeding online, but I guess the question I have is, and I know there is an easy answer to this, who are you competing with online? I mean is it just Amazon or are there other companies playing in your space that you are competing with? And as you look at that competitive landscape right now, maybe Bed Bath & Beyond has been late to the online game, so if there are companies who are performing better, perhaps your markets are better [indiscernible], isn't it just a [indiscernible] mission amongst consumers because they were there earlier or is there some factor you think that play [indiscernible] what are the reasons the other companies are performing better online? Steven H. Temares I could think that online the truth is that we compete against many more people, that there are people that look for credible retailers, but a lot of people are searching for items or they are looking for inspiration in the furniture and decor area, and whomever shows up could be redeemed credible. And so there is a lot more competition online than there was in the four walls. So I think that's the reality. And when you say that there are things that you could do to increase your market share, and we do some of that obviously that are rational for us, but there are things that you could do that a little less rational, you could spend a lot more on your advertising to buy sales. I mean we have competitors that do that and that's part of the way that they choose to do business. So ultimately, we believe that having the right assortment, having best in class Web-site in terms of search, content, assortment to services that are attached to it, that combined with the omni-channel experience is a winning formula. But that short-term decision whether you are looking every day, your ad to sales ratio on your advertising for your online is something that you could play with on a daily basis, and you can for short-term periods, you can buy sales but at the expense of the bottom line. And then you have to ask yourself, what's the stickiness of that customer, the lifetime value of the customer, you make a lot of assumptions and you test into it and you look back on to see if you were right or wrong. But the idea about the whole thing about market share is a tough one because when we look at us for example coming out of the fourth quarter, I guess there was a number of our competitors who are all great competitors, the William Sonomas, the Targets, the Macy's, the Kohl's, the Restorations, all these people had not great quarters. And so, are we gaining market share, they are losing market share or the people shop a little bit less in our category and so maybe the whole market share, the whole market was a little bit lower. We don't have finite numbers to know those answers, but clearly our digital space is growing at a rapid pace and we believe we are gaining market share. We think that we are experiencing in our stores is similar or perhaps slightly better than what we see happening in the general retail marketplace. So if those are correct conclusions, we would say that perhaps we are picking up market share, but we are not satisfied and it's very negligible one way or the other to really understand if that's the case. Does that answer the question, Brian? Okay. Operator Our next question comes from Dan Binder from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst This is [indiscernible] on for Dan. In light of all the retail store closures that are coming this year, several of these retailers compete in categories that overlap categories that you compete in. So given this, how do you assess the promotional environment that you see over the year and are there any particular quarters where you anticipate a little bit more gross margin pressure from heightened promotional activity? Steven H. Temares I don't think that we will know that. In fact I think that we didn't see necessarily or know exactly when Linens-N-Things are in 3-D or [Strauss] [ph] or [indiscernible] or Home Express or Pacific Linens or JCPenney Home Stores, [indiscernible] people were closing stores. We didn't know that Macy's was going to close those stores or that Penney was closing those stores or what's going to happen with Sears and Kmart. So we really can't tell you or predict a particular point in time that the competitive landscape shifts. But when it shifts, we anticipate that in the short-term there is some pain and in the long-term there is benefit. Operator Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simeon Gutman First question just on guidance, just two quick parts, the comp guidance, little flatfish to slightly positive for next year, can you just [indiscernible] what's the confidence? I know it's a slight improvement. Looks like home furnishing retail sales are a little weaker than they were let's say 12 months ago. And then Sue, can you tell us about what's the embedded EBIT margin in the guidance or a range? Susan E. Lattmann Okay, so starting with the comp guidance, we are coming off of a Q4 which was a positive 0.4 comp. I think Steve discussed some of the initiatives, whether it's furniture initiatives, personalization initiatives becoming more inspirational. Those are things we are working on throughout the year. And coming off that positive 0.4 comp, that's our model, that's where we see for now for modeling purposes and we will update it as the year progresses. Your second question I believe was on EBIT margin? Simeon Gutman Correct, yes. If you could just share what's the implied range within the EPS guidance? Steven H. Temares I don't think we provided that. We did say that the tax rate would be higher in 2017 than it was in 2016. Susan E. Lattmann We did. Steven H. Temares Interest should be relatively flat year-over-year, at least we believe it will be. So I guess the EBIT range would be slightly better than the EPS range on a per share basis, but we didn't give details about that. Simeon Gutman Okay. And my follow-up, if you look at back at 2016, could you have accelerated some of the investments, therefore that leaves some less to do in 2017, and then thinking about 2017, realize this may be a never evolving answer, but you've probably been asked multiple times, does this year represent the peak investment period, et cetera? Again, it's evolving, but any sense on that, can you answer that with clarity at this point? Susan E. Lattmann We provided our model which is around $400 million to $425 million. We came in at around $374 million for 2016. And so if you go back and you look historically, that's a peak for us at $374 million and we see that plateauing in that range of the model and where we ended up certainly for 2017. A CapEx model is fluid. Things happen throughout the year. Sometimes we are accelerating certain projects that we didn't originally plan and sometimes due to sequential basis we are pushing projects out. And then sometimes there are projects that we didn't even initially planned that we end up partway through the year make sense, whether it's for strategic reasons or financial reasons. So, we make those decisions as we go and that's our best model estimate at this time. Operator Our next question comes from Brad Thomas from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Bradley Thomas One of the things the Company has done very well over the years is to take products from teams that it has acquired like Harmon and buybuy BABY and integrated into the core Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Could you maybe talk about what inning you are in with Harmon and buybuy BABY products and some of the other ones, and what role, if any, you see for some of the online brands to have a presence in the Bed Bath & Beyond stores? Steven H. Temares I think that you could look at the Web-site to see the numbers of Harmon, where the health and beauty care, the four departments, I think it's a couple of hundred I think is the number there. I'm not giving any trade secrets. So I think there is an opportunity as we go forward for that. I think the buybuy BABY departments in the store are very few relative to that even. And so all those are opportunities to do more of this as we rollover real estate opportunities, because when we opened up those stores they weren't sized for those additional departments and things that we have in the store are very productive and obviously Harmon is commodity goods and Baby margins are in Bed Bath margin. So that's things that will evolve over time and the cost of the real estate and all those things will play into what the stores look like going forward. As far as the other online brands, I mean when we look at for example the PMall and the opportunity for them to create personalized product, we talked about them being seasonal and the opportunity for them to use all their processes and to provide product to Bed Bath & Beyond for example, that's a significant opportunity for us. So that's something that we are all working on so that we do see and we were growing personalized products in our stores. Again, that's another differentiator for us, so we think that's important. When you talk about somebody like a Decorist, we've looked at the ability to provide additional services, decorating services within stores. One Kings Lane had the studio in San Francisco, a studio in New York, and that's part of their – and they just opened up something that's a hybrid situation in Connecticut which we think was very interesting. So the ability to provide that decorating service in some of the Bed Bath & Beyond stores is an opportunity. When you look at the fact that we are growing furniture and home decor online, the ability to take some of that furniture, whether it would be One Kings Lane or other furniture offerings can show it to some degree in a way in our stores so customers understand that we are in the furniture business, so that's a growing opportunity for us as well. But in each of these areas is that we do have to figure out the right points of integration so the customer understands that we have the product that they are looking for, for the entire home and that we can be trusted as the expert for the home. So these are all things that are being done, some are further along than others and the ones that you pointed to, Harmon is further along, and Baby, we have certain departments in certain parts of the country that take advantage of the Christmas Tree Shops seasonal merchandise because they do such a wonderful job at seasonal. So you could find that in Bed Bath & Beyond stores. So all of this is something that very much continues to be a work in progress, but over time I think you will see more of it and we'll leverage it to a greater degree. Bradley Thomas Great. Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from Laura Champine from Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead. Laura Champine When you talk about adding more furniture into your stores, what do you move out to make room for that, or is this new assortment just going in into expanded and remodelled stores? Steven H. Temares Obviously again you are talking about Bed Bath, because in furniture already you could find furniture at Cost Plus, you could find furniture at the Baby, obviously it's a significant and important part of the Baby assortment. That Christmas Tree sells furniture in Bed Bath, sells certain furniture. But again, there is different thought process and different things that we've been testing. But if you even take a look, I don't know if you have had an opportunity to see the studio experience at One Kings Lane, in a small amount of space you could really explain to the customer that you're in this business. So you might not necessarily sell much out of the store or carry much in the store, but you can really show the customer that we are in these businesses, we stand for these businesses, and explain that they can find it online, because even when you go into a Restoration, their offering is limited relative to you find somebody walking around with a tablet and they show you the breadth of the assortment. So really the key is, we don't expect, and we are not saying that we're going to be a furniture store, but how do we get across to the customer that we are in the furniture business and the stores don't become a disadvantage where people say or think you're not in the furniture business because we don't show it at all and the store explains to the customer that we are in the business. Laura Champine Got it. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Budd Bugatch from Raymond James. Please go ahead. David This is David on for Budd. Thank you for taking my question. Steven, I wanted to follow up with the answer you were just giving. So in terms of making customers aware of all the product lines and businesses that Bed Bath & Beyond stands for, what do you see going forward as you having to do to achieve that goal? Is it spending more in advertising, is it leveraging the customer less and doing more targeted marketing? How do you think about it and what does it mean for some of the operating expenses and capital expenditures going forward? Steven H. Temares For the first place obviously is that you could address it in our stores, that if the people, if our customers coming to the stores understood that we had an expanded assortment, that would be wonderful. So there is a lot of ways to do that that are not big capital expenditures. And then what we do already, and there is a shift in what we do, so there is a shift in where we spend our dollars and how we spend the dollars. So how do you – what are in your e-mail campaigns, what are in your CRM programs, what are you doing with your catalogs, what are you showing, how much are you showing and how you are describing to the customers. So, a great deal of it could be achieved through a shift. And then obviously it's spending more to the degree that it drives the returns we're looking for, that would be wonderful as well. So there is a lot of things that can be done. So really we haven't even addressed the customers that walk into our stores and really have done a sufficient job of letting that customer know the categories we are growing, and again, we haven't been in a rush to do that because we don't believe in many categories we are at the point that we are rushing to get the customer there because we are presenting the merchandise in a way with content and features and facets and shopability in a way that makes it best in class. So as we go down the road of shoring rooms and being inspirational and showing having the photography right and having the content right and having the chat up to speed so that we can answer the questions, and having our vendors up to speed so they could deliver appropriately and that we could deliver to people's homes with White Glove delivery and we could deliver out of our stores with the third-party partners who could pick it up and deliver it for the customers, and so all these things are more in place. We are not in a rush to show the customer we do something not great. So when we do things, we get to the point where we think that we're doing it well enough or great. The last part and the easy part will be marketing to the customer. David Okay. And then to follow, the logical follow-up to that is, when do you think most of those things will be in place? Steven H. Temares It's a gamut, because for example like even the delivery, the delivery network, to get delivery right we signed at this very local to take the last mile on delivery, and that if somebody is delivering the sofa versus delivering a mirror, that there is going to be in a lot of cases different delivery service. So again, everything that we are doing has a different timeline and it's not as if we are going to wait for everything to be perfect before we start taking particular categories and shouting that we are in this business. But literally, if you go online today and you take a look at some of the categories, you look literally at how we show it or how easily it's shopped or shopable, there are things that we have a lot to be desired. You shouldn't be when you are looking at it for upholstery or you are looking for sizes or you are looking for certain looks or feels, again, it should be easy for the customer and we need to really to make sure that we are attributing product correctly, that we are showing it in a way that we are really resonating with the customer in being able to do certain things in an inspirational way, so that it's close to best-in-class at least as we try to get and will get to best-in-class. So, each of these things has a different timeline. David Okay. Thank you. Operator I would now turn the call back over to Janet Barth for closing remarks. Janet M. Barth Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to having you join us again on our next quarterly earnings call on June 22nd. Have a good evening. Operator Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

John Chen Thank you, Charlie. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our fiscal 2017 fourth quarter results conference call. As is customary, I will reference non-GAAP numbers in my summary of our quarterly results. There is a reconciliation table of GAAP to non-GAAP results in the press release. I am pleased to report that our Q4 results came in at or above forecast in all major metrics. Let me run through a high-level summary of that. Revenue came in at $297 million, a noteworthy accomplishment. A stellar growth in software and services exceed the decline in SAF and almost nearly offset the decline in hardware and SAF combined. Total Company software and services revenue came in at $193 million. This represents an increase of 25% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. We achieved our full year target of 30% growth with total software and services of $687 million -- I’m sorry, that’s $687 million. Of course, I’m very pleased with that accomplishment. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 65%. Operating income was $13 million, and EPS was positive $0.04. Note that we achieved the last breakeven of positive -- at least break even or positive EPS each quarter in FY17. For the quarter, we were able to return to positive free cash flow at $16 million, while ending cash -- our ending cash came in at $1.7 billion, up $89 million from last quarter. In our strategic areas of focus, we are executing well and winning important opportunities. As a reminder, our end-to-end secure platform consists of 4 main components. One, the unified endpoint management, we call it UEM; two, horizontal and vertical mobile apps; three, embedded software enabling mobile endpoints such as connected cars; and last but not least, four, the IoT appliances such as BlackBerry Radar. Each of the above areas give us good opportunity for growth and they’re synergistic across all these areas. In addition, our licensing programs are seeing good traction. We have growing pipelines of opportunity in mobile and security software, CPaaS, security software CPaaS, which I am going to cover a little bit later, communication platform as a service and IP licensing. So, now, let me provide you some color on some of the key accomplishments. In enterprise, we saw good win rates and had one of our strongest ever billing quarters, and please don’t ask me what the number is. We processed 3,532 customer orders in Q4, an increase of 16% from last quarter. Notably, we had several large wins with customer in non-regulator industry indicating that our security offering is beginning to resonate in the broader enterprise market. We also saw good performance across the major geographies. Some high profile wins included the Deutsche Post DHL, Nationwide Mutual Insurance, Sutter Health, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Queensland Investment Corporation, Idaho Power, Parliamentary Services in Australia. We are also seeing traction expanding in our partner reach. I have two success stories to share with you. One, in our partnership with China Mobile, we won a 10,000-seat pilot with China Co-Op Group. We’re excited about the significant partner win as well as the potential to expand our business in China. Earlier this month, the Vodafone Germany announced it is the first carrier to offer the full BlackBerry Enterprise Mobility Suite through the SIM-based licensing. Vodafone is offering all tiers and capabilities of our secure suite for managing endpoints, mobile apps, secure messaging, identity management as well as content. You will recall that last quarter we launched our federal Cybersecurity Operations Center focused on achieving FedRAMP certification for the U.S. government. After the quarter, our crisis management platform achieved the FedRAMP and Authority to Operate certificates. We intend to take most of our enterprise products through the certification process. Also on the cyber security front, Giuliani Partner selected BlackBerry Secure as the underlying software platform to support its consulting practice for government enterprise customer. This is the great start in our security services business and you should expect more of these types of partnerships in the future. In embedded software, we’re showcasing our capability to enable the connected cars of the future. Earlier this year at CES, we announced our most advanced and secure embedded offering for autonomous drive and connected cars. The QNS software development platform 7.0, the key feature of that is the 64 bit operating system which enables high performance for more powerful domain controllers inside vehicles. Also included are enhanced kernel-level security protect against the malfunction, malware and cyber attack. The 7.0 release works with ARMv8 and Intel x86, 64 bit architecture. 62 partners have already signed up as beta users on the platform. These partners are in four main groups, in automotive; chip makers; general embedded; and other applications including ISVs. We demonstrated a Level 4 self driving scenario on test track with the Lincoln MKC powered by the BlackBerry software and Renesas hardware, and that’s also at CES, sorry. We also demonstrated at CES a prototype of vehicle management portal. With over 100 million lines of code now, a software code in some of today’s vehicle, there is a growing risk of security breaches and failures. This portal would be targeted for automotive makers and Tier 1 suppliers. It allows user to scan software code, identify vulnerabilities or exposure and view key parameters and attributes in a dashboard view. We received extremely positive feedback from the CES attendees, and we expect to launch this offering later in the fiscal year. In the IoT appliances, we continue to win new business, and we’re building our proof of concept pipeline. I’m pleased to announce Trailer Wizards selected Radar in Q4. Trailer Visits is Canadians’ largest commercial trailer rental and storage companies with 25,000 trailers. Our pipeline is progressing in this area with higher POCs and advancing to older states and new POC entering the funnel, including we added six of them in Q4. Finally, our licensing programs are seeing good traction on multiple fronts. In the quarter, we entered into a long-term software licensing agreement with Optiemus, Optiemus Infracom, to the official name to design, manufacture, sell and support BlackBerry brand mobile devices in the country of India, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh. This is the third major device software licensing agreement that we have signed, and we now cover the globe through our agreements, which also included BB Merah Putih, which is the Indonesian outfit and TCL in China. The first two devices were already launched -- were recently launched. The KEYone -- that’s the name, not key one like the most important one. That might be the reason. The KEYone was launched by TCL at Mobile World Congress last month. There were 400 attendees at the launch event, and the device won 10 Mobile World Congress Best of Show awards. Earlier this month, the BlackBerry Aurora was launched in Indonesia with participation from the Indonesian Ministers of Communication and the Canadian Ambassador. There were also 300-plus dealers and 100-plus BlackBerry retail trainers in attendance. We are now expanding to the next phase of our licensing program. This will focus on a broader set of endpoints. What this might mean, and I make no promise, is that you may soon see a BlackBerry tablet, and it will also extend to cobranded handset with IoT and Enterprise of Things to EoT devices. These endpoints will run our software and security features and be cobranded Secure by BlackBerry. We recently released our latest secure handset software from Android. The codename for our product -- the codename for our internal project is by name of Black Widow. [Ph] This release has significant enhancements in enterprise management capabilities, which should support our expanding licensing program. I spoke earlier about the Communication Platform as a Service or CPaaS. The market is a new market opportunity under our licensing efforts also. We launched the BBM Enterprise SDK to address this opportunity. This capability allows partners and developers to integrate secure messaging, voice and video into their application and services. Since the launch, we have seen great receptivity to this release. The offering became available in early February, and 15 ISV has already signed up to start development on with the SDK. We’re seeing solid interest in our offering and specifically in the security features and the internet protocol delivery. We are expecting the first partner apps to be available in Q2. This is again reason significant to us is we will get royalty as the partner start shipping applications. Going forward, we’ll continue to shift resources into all these growth areas I just covered. We’re also investing in partnership and opportunity to expand our global footprint. I will now turn the call over to Steve for a much more detailed look at our financial. Steve? Steve Capelli Thank you, John. Today, we reported Q4 GAAP revenue of $286 million and non-GAAP revenue of $297 million with a GAAP EPS loss of $0.09; non-GAAP EPS was a positive $0.04. Our non-GAAP income statement presentation excludes purchase accounting deferred revenue write-down, debenture fair value adjustment, stock comp expense, restructuring program charges, inventory write-down, amortization of purchased intangibles and business acquisition and integration charges. My comments on our financial performance for the quarter will be in non-GAAP terms unless specified otherwise. For a reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP numbers, please see the earnings press release and supplement published earlier today. I will begin with a consolidated review of our Q4 FY17 income statement results and move on to the individual segments thereafter. Now, let me begin with the consolidated income statement results. Our total revenue for the fourth quarter was $297 million. Our consolidated gross margin was 65% compared to 49% a year ago. Our non-GAAP gross margin excludes restructuring program charges of $6 million, inventory impairment of $4 million and stock comp expense of $1 million. The gross margin improvement of 1,600 basis points over a year ago is attributed to growth of software and services, and more favorable revenue mix. As a result, we are increasing our outlook for consolidated gross margin to approximately 70% for FY18, an 800 basis-point improvement from 62% for all of FY17; operating expenses for $181 million, down from $198 million last quarter. As John mentioned earlier, we are shifting resources with the focus on channels and customer-facing areas, and we will be investing in growth initiatives in FY18. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $47 million. Our non-GAAP operating expenses excluding $28 million in amortization of acquired intangibles, $19 million in restructuring charges, $14 million in stock comp expense, $3 million in business acquisition and integration charges, and a benefit of $16 million of fair value adjustment related to the debentures. Non-GAAP operating income was a positive $13 million and non-GAAP income was $23 million. Our adjusted EBITDA was approximately $42 million this quarter, excluding the non-GAAP adjustments previously mentioned. I will now provide a breakdown of our revenue. Total Company software and services was $193 million, representing 65% of total revenue. Roughly 80% of software and services segment revenue excluding IP licensing and professional services was recurring in nature. Device revenue was $55 million, representing 19% of revenue. Total SAF revenue for the fourth quarter was $49 million, representing 16% of revenue. SAF revenue was down 26% quarter-over-quarter. We continue to model a sequential decline in SAF revenue of roughly 25% next quarter. All of our business segments were profitable in Q4 on an operating basis. Now moving to our balance sheet and working capital performance. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments increased to $1.7 billion, up $89 million from $1.6 billion last quarter. Our net cash position was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter. Aggregate contractual obligations, which includes purchase obligations, operating lease obligations, interest payments, and other goods and services utilized in operations was approximately $398 million at the end of Q4; this is down from $860 million a year ago. There were no purchase orders with contract manufacturers at the end of Q4; this is down from $162 million a year ago and $35 million at the end of Q3. Moving to the cash flow statement. Free cash flow was a positive $16 million in the fourth quarter, which consisted of cash flow from operations of a positive $19 million and capital expenditures of $3 million. Looking forward, we expect positive free cash flow and EBITDA for the full 2018 fiscal year. That concludes my comments. I’ll now turn the call back to John. John Chen Thank you, Steve. Let me now comment on the fiscal year 2018. With our focus and shift towards a software model, we have consolidated our software business to enable tighter product and go-to-market integration. This will make our sales channel more efficient, which allow us to deliver higher value to our customers. With these related changes in our organizational structure, we are addressing the need to revise our segment reporting, beginning next quarter. While we work through the appropriate disclosure requirements, we expect to continue to provide information broken down by software and services, hardware and SAF. We are now taking -- we also are taking into account that many of our shareholders have requested better revenue visibility of our software and services business. Now, on to our outlook for FY18. In our software and services business, we expect to grow at or above the overall market. After completing our planning process and based on our portfolio breakdown, we see market growth of roughly about 10% to 15% on average. We are now targeting the higher end of the range, so somewhere between 13% to 15%. We also expect to be profitable on a non-GAAP basis and free cash flow positive for the full year. With these expectations in mind and looking at the analyst models, I’m generally comfortable with the current consensus for revenue and EPS for Q1 as well as the full year. Now, I will open the call up for Q&A. Operator, will you please administrate that? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Steven Li of Raymond James. The line is open, sir. Steven Li Hi, John and Steve. John, a couple of quarters ago, you talk about continuing to harden the BlackBerry software and achieve DoD certifications. Can you give us an update on that? John Chen Yes. Let’s see. We have NIAP certification a quarter ago. So that’s done. I mean, that’s done for the 10.3.3. We released that. So that’s the latest and greatest. We have a further hardening of the products in the Android side, which I just spoke about. We released that also, codename Black Widow, and we continue to spend a lot of time and resources on further doing more certification and more hardening. But the immediate task has been done. Steven Li Great. And you expect both certifications to drive some licensing revenues for you in mobility solutions or do you see them mostly as upside, potential upside? John Chen I think, first of all, the NIAP certification and then also the FedRAMP certification is required to do business in the critical arena with at least for the United States government, and I think it’s acceptable to a lot of governments around the world after we pass in the U.S. standard. So, we have achieved all that. So, it is anchor to our federal business as a whole, both in the UEM side of the equation as well as the ad hoc side of the equation. So, it’s both. The answer to your question is really both. It’s baked into support our current businesses or growing our current businesses as well as winning new projects. We will also license it but where it’s applicable by law. Operator Thank you. Your next questions from Paul Steep of Scotia Capital. Paul Steep Great. John, could you talk a little bit and maybe as well, Steven, with SAF coming down, can you John on the NOC side, talk about how you think about repurposing this infrastructure? Obviously, huge investment, it’s critical. And then Steve, sort of tying into John’s response, how should we think about managing the cost down on that significant infrastructure? John Chen Good question. This is one that we work on continuously. First of all, we’re very proud of our infrastructure in NOCs and many components of NOCs, some of them have to do with security and some of them have to do with relay forwarding. So, where we make sense of the cost structure and how we spend the money, we will repurpose it. We have a number of ideas. I think it’s too premature for me to comment on it, but I would just confirm the fact that we will keep it for our customers because a lot of consumers in their critical infrastructure relied on it; it is a value add that only BlackBerry could bring to the market, but we will also repurpose it as the capacity of the SAF requirements are coming down. So, you asked the right question. I can’t provide you a more detailed answer because it’s still work in progress. Steve Capelli From a cost structure perspective, we have done some stair step measures over the past 12 to 18 months. And the current position that we’re in can still come down but at small levels. With our plans to repurpose, we don’t feel at this point in time there is a need to dramatically change the cost structure for SAF. Obviously, we will review that, should that become necessary. Operator Thank you. And our next question is from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Maynard Um So, if I grow your software business at a 13% to 15% pace, and I think you said your gross margin guidance was 70% for fiscal 2018, does that imply that you’re seeing a decline in your software gross margins in fiscal 2018 or maybe just walk through, where you’re seeing the biggest gross margin impact. Because I think it implies that you’re seeing some decline somewhere. John Chen No, I think it’s a balance of the portfolio. I think Steve said the 70% is where the Company is, and we’re now centering without kind of onetime thing. You remember that a quarter ago, we’re at 70%, but that was a benefit of the warranty side of the equation on devices when we get out of devices. So that’s a onetime thing. The normalized margin is in the mid-50% -- mid-60%. So I think the 65% is really good number for where we are in the portfolio and the percentage of the portfolio. And what Steve is talking about was we’re going to bring it up to 70%. We’re going to work ourselves improving. So, think about it, there are 500 basis point improvement overall in the Company that we’re expecting in FY ‘18. So it’s not a decline of any sort. Steve Capelli And as you look at our software and services businesses as it is today, those margins are 80%, and we expect obviously that same construction of revenue to still have roughly 80% as well. But the combination of all the factors would get us to about 70% for the entire year. Maynard Um Okay. Thanks. And then, can you just talk about the key drivers of that 13% to 15% growth? I think your core MDM and your QNX businesses are your two largest segments. I’m just curious whether you think you can grow those at or closer to those rates? Thank you. John Chen Yes. I think the -- depending on who you look at, I mean, I look at some IDC numbers and Gartner and all that and for the UEM space, and UEM space is broader than just that the EMM space. We look at that number next year that people kind of looking at it at about 10% to 12.5% depending on who you look at. We think we could do better than that. That’s one component of that or Carl thinks he could do better than that. I think it doesn’t matter. Sandeep has a pretty good plan in QNX and particularly going Radar, and that’s -- and I spoke about some of the new ideas like the vehicle portal. Vehicle portals are charged on per month basis per vehicle. So, they’re another recurring revenue; I hope we could build up. So, there is a combination of some current existing products, which we’re very proud of and some of the new stuff that’s coming in online. Not everything will work, as you all know, but I think we’ve got enough iron in the fire that the combination of that makes us feel comfortable we could grow at that numbers. Operator Thanks. Your next question is from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Tim Long Just a clarification and a question. Just trying to get to the software numbers for the quarter. Could you -- it looks like maybe $27 million was reallocated from the traditional reporting. Maybe it moved from Mobility Solutions to software. So, we see the $166 million in there in one of the tables. Can you just clarify what that is? And on the -- maybe answer that, and then I’ll come back with another. John Chen What was that? Steve Capelli He said, answer that; maybe I’ll come back with another. John Chen Oh, I thought we have only one question. Okay, I got it. Yes, that is professional services revenue that apply to helping customers to deploy some of their applications and building some of the applications. So, those are engineers in the mobility group. That’s why the revenue is being reported in the mobility group because the cost is also being reported in mobility group. But these are services and software. Tim Long Okay. So, this is a recurring business; this isn’t just something that happened in the quarter? John Chen We hope so. We hope we will recur it. You know that it ties to task and project and assignments. So, we do hope so. Tim Long Okay. And secondly, on the mobility and the device side, a decent quarter there. Could you just walk us through again the timing of when you think the licensing piece will have a material impact both on revenues and what it means for gross margins for that business? John Chen Yes. It’s a little bit of -- it kind of depends on how you and I define material. But, let me put it in the following way. We just launched two phones or our partners just -- or we helped our partners launch two phones, one in Indonesia, and that one is shipping already. The second one that TCL announced at the Mobile World Congress, which is the physical keyboard on an Android, that one is not going to be slated to ship until probably May timeframe. I think the first production - manufacturing production run is the end of April. So, the product looks pretty good, but the worldwide visibility is going to be later than May. We get it obviously on a quarterly basis on reported ship per unit. So, you could kind of think about that and model that and calculate that. So, from the Indonesia one, we should see -- starting to see some revenue this quarter, and it start ramping up. And that’s our general idea is to pipeline these and then keep growing, the numbers. So, I’d say probably towards the end of the year that you could see some numbers that are significant enough, but you’re going to start seeing some level of ramp up or we should be start seeing some level of ramp. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Gus Papageorgiou of Macquarie. Your line is open. Gus Papageorgiou Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just on Radar, I’m wondering if you can give us a bit of an update there. How many traders or can you give us indication how many traders you currently have on that platform? And what’s your goal for the year? John Chen I don’t have how many traders. You guys have how many traders? In the thousands, right? Steve Capelli Yes. John Chen I’m sorry. I didn’t add up how many traders. My focus had always been the proof of concept and the win, and the reason is everybody will order 500, 1,000, 2,000, those kind of numbers to start even if they have 25,000 trailers, which in this case that we won a trailer with it, they had 25,000 trailers and containers. So, I would say what I focus in on -- in the early orders, the initial orders that usually are much more modest, once they start rolling it out, they literally go then to order just in time. So, to me, it’s really not so much as how many do we have right now but how many are we winning. Gus Papageorgiou When do you think Radar will be material for your revenues, like will it be sometime this year or will it be… John Chen Yes, absolutely. This is a reasonably big piece of our growth plan of the Company that Sandeep is driving, yes. The answer to the question is yes. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Anil Doradla of William Blair. Your line is open. Anil Doradla Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So, John, just a clarification here. You talk about 13% to 15%; is that based on when you look at the software and services revenue, is that based on the $166 million, which is purely software or some of the reallocations which is going on, the $20 plus million, so that’s like $194 million? So, what are you basing that 15% -- 13% to 15% growth? John Chen I base on the whole thing. So, you guys keep thinking about reallocation. It is not reallocation; it is the people in that group doing software and services. This is why I have to redo the reporting because I think it’s misleading to you all. You all think about mobility solution. When we first put our mobility solution, we used the word mobility solution; we didn’t use the word device, okay? Because I knew this is our plan. Our plan is to get into licensing and get into services because we have a lot of great engineers. And so to remind everybody, these engineers are all QNX-based engineers. The reason is our BB10 was QNX-based. So, it’s not a reallocation, repurpose, whatever it is. It is growing as software business with our device business if that makes sense to people. And so yes, when I talk about 13% to 15%, I talk about as the whole of the software, including that piece. Anil Doradla Very good. And as a follow-up, we saw good drop-off in R&D. Can you explain and give some little bit more color, was it personnel-driven, tools, technology-driven, and how should we be looking at the prioritization in fiscal 2018 on the R&D front? John Chen I didn’t -- could you please repeat that? Steve Capelli Drop in R&D expense, wanted to know really what was behind that? John Chen There are many components. And I think in some areas, we were a little too heavy. Some of the -- we no longer design the hardware, antennas and keyboards and power and supply and all that. We don’t do those anymore. We no longer need engineers in the factories helping the devices -- building devices. So that’s the basic part of it. We also have consolidated some locations, and we also have using some of our overseas locations. So, there’s a combination of things to drive down the cost as a percentage spend on revenue. And so, we’re very focused on getting ourselves into a good model. Steve Capelli I also want to add that if you’re looking at our Mobility Solutions group, you see quite a large decline in that OpEx, and that’s really related to the fact that many of those people providing the services that John just spoke about and that their costs would be resting in COGS associated with the revenue as opposed to just an operating expense. Anil Doradla Great. And if I could squeeze one final thing, John, you’re talking about this new reporting structure to clarify some of this misunderstanding. So, is this just more of a front-end investor kind of presentation or in the backend, are you reorganizing the Company to support this kind of new reporting structure? John Chen We reorganize the company. Operator Our next question’s from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Meta Marshall Hi. This is Meta for James. Just a question on the Ford and QNX announcement yesterday about them hiring some of the QNX employees from BlackBerry, and so just wanted to get a sense of should that change how we think of the OpEx of BlackBerry going forward; and does this just reinforce the relationship, just a little bit about that announcement from yesterday? John Chen Well, first of all, they did not hire QNX engineer. There are some engineers that was hired from our mobility group, but the details I’m not going to comment on, on that particular report. All our numbers that we just provided have factored in everything. So, please don’t take the expense down further because like I have mentioned, and I think Steve mentioned, we actually have a headcount growth plan in mind, but that also is already factored in what we guided, which fits to the Street models on a consensus basis. Operator Our next one is from Paul Treiber of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Paul Treiber Hi. Thanks very much and good morning. Just regards to the professional services in Mobility Solutions, could you elaborate on the type of work that they are doing and then how that may lead to future software revenue or is it solely one-time without the potential for future software revenue? John Chen No. We are not a -- it is good question, thank you because this gave me a chance to clarify. All the work being done are aimed at selling licenses or to create royalty revenue of the future. So, we are not a body shop of any kind. Paul Treiber Okay. Thanks for clarifying. In regards to the agreement with Ford that the press release that you put out last year and in regards to the employees, generally speaking, what’s the opportunity for BlackBerry if an automaker makes a significant investment like Ford’s doing in QNX? And then is it more than just the ASP of the basic OS? John Chen Oh, yes. See, this is where -- first of all, a car is really a computer on the road or mobile computer on the road. And so, each component in it, if you remember, the company at BlackBerry started with a pretty dominant position in infotainment. So, if anyone of you have a 2016 model Ford or a Jaguar or a number of different cars, you are using BlackBerry software. So, the Ford 2016 model has our Sync 3; it’s on BlackBerry, and this is a public statement on both companies. So, I’m not giving you any proprietary information. So, Ford has decided and worked so well with us that they have decided to expand using our software. And then there are areas of telematics; there are areas of safety, ADAS areas, all of that, BlackBerry actually has and have offer in the market. And we continue to build new products and new modules and new ideas of like, for example, on the cyber security side I mentioned the portal management, a vehicle portal management. We hope Ford will take a very, very serious look at it. And with that, we could start having recurring revenue for ourselves and for Ford. We also have over-the-air technology that Ford’s very interested in. So, it’s a much more bigger than just a basic OS. It’s horizontal application; it’s how cars put together and how cars modules talk to each other. Future car is basically one huge program. So, I am very bullish, and this is only with Ford, and it is nonexclusive. So, if I could do more with others, other car manufacturers around the world, Europe, Asia that will be even better. Paul Treiber Just one follow-up to that. In regards to other automakers, I mean, what do you think the likelihood of winning agreements of a similar magnitude of Ford? John Chen Likely. Paul Treiber Okay. Thank you. John Chen We just need a little bit of time. We are pretty -- as we are recognized leader in this whole world and both in the QNX embedded software as well as in cyber, cyber security. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Todd Coupland of CIBC. Your line is now open. Todd Coupland Just a clarification on OpEx, and then I had a QNX question. So, are you saying on OpEx that the $190 million, plus or minus, is the baseline and that’ll grow some but revenue and margins will grow faster, which gets you to the operating leverage in 2018; is that the takeaway? John Chen Yes. That’s pretty much our model, yes. Todd Coupland Okay. So, my question on QNX and just the automotive opportunity. So, with respect to that last question, John, I get like all those pieces you’re working on. The one thing we’re struggling with is if you sort of stack all that up without giving us individual pricing on each one of those areas, when you think about sort of a per car opportunity for your business, how are you thinking about that? Is that over time, $10 per car, $50 per car? How are you thinking about it? John Chen Yes, I think about it. So, I’ll give you the current -- I’m not giving you the pricing of that. But if you look at our current infotainment systems, I think the street price is about $3 to $5 a car. That’s the Street price. So my competitors and myself and everybody is in that neighborhood. And if you stack these modules together, the ARPU should be 4, 5 times of that number. Now of course, now you have to do discount it, and you’ve got the volume wise it and then the new product that’s got coming out. So, I mean it’s just a normal type of business where you continue to enhance the offering, and each of the offering is a module, and you get royalty on that and then -- and one of the thing that I think is exciting for us is not that we’re done there, by the way. I just want to make sure that everybody understands. When I talk about a portal, a vehicle portal management, it’s kind of the next things that we’re focusing on is to generally recurring monthly revenue and all from these kind of the world of connected cars and the need to have enhanced security or constant monitoring of security and antihacking and malware. So, all the stuff that I talk about, all have a common theme in how we grow our business and our revenue. So rather than getting a set amount of dollars per car when we roll it out the manufacturing line, we want that too. We want that, and we want a higher ARPU of that, and we want a service component of that on a monthly basis. Todd Coupland And when you think about this business over the next, let’s say, three years, auto market globally is 100 million units. What’s a realistic market share for QNX? John Chen That’s a great question. I would tell you this. Infotainment, we own over half the market today, 60 million cars. So, I hope that give us some leverage and continue R&D, and this is why we created the autonomous driving car centers, innovation centers in Ottawa a quarter-plus ago because we wanted to attract partners with us to build application on our platform. People often asked me what I’m going to build an autonomous car. No, I’m not. I’m not building an autonomous car. I don’t want to compete with my customer, nor do I want to compete with very, very big name that wanted to spend hundreds of millions, if not billions in there. I’m not building any autonomous car. I am building the components that enable other people to build their autonomous car. And we created a platform in Ottawa. We welcome anybody who come in, and we have a lot of partners that come in and test out on our platform, and so they could work on their autonomous part of the car. Today, the connected car is a huge market as you all know. The autonomous car is probably going to be post-2020 so forth and so forth. I mean I’m getting too much into it, but we also we are very excited about this market. Operator Thank you. Your next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kulbinder Garcha Thank you. Just one clarification and one question. On the clarification, in the quarter, were there any major IP or patent sales onetime in nature or otherwise? John Chen No, our IP numbers are very small in the quarter. Kulbinder Garcha And then, basically for the full year then in 2018, what you guys sound like you say that software and services growth in that double-digit range of 13% to 15% maybe gross margin at 70%, and you should have OpEx from this run rate exiting the year going to be down or is it going to grow. Actually I missed that point. Can you clarify that part? John Chen Yes. As I said, I mean, I don’t want to make a single statement on one area because I think when we review the consensus model that you all have for Q1 and for the year, it looks quite reasonable. Interesting enough, when we roll out our numbers, it’s very close to your numbers. So that’s good. That’s goodness. So, we are going to grow our expenses because we have many areas that we would like to invest in. However, we are also going to reduce some of the areas. So, I think, by and large, the growth in expenses will be relatively modest throughout the year because we’re going to be taking some of the cost structure out, and we’re going to try to find ways to do things in much more efficient way and effective way and then invest the dollars. And we, in fact, you folks may not know this, but I’ll give you one stack. We actually have hired 1,000 people last year, and I know everybody’s going to ask me about that, right? But we have a pretty big feel now reach to the market, and we cover almost all the financial institutions in the G7 world, so to speak, and the governments. So, we have a pretty good execution in the field now. We have a very big customer support team that is more customer-facing than in the professional services. But in the meantime, we have shifted away -- our G&A came down quite a bit and headcount. So, it’s just that way of also rationalizing where we put our money and where the number is. So, if you go back to model, that is now consensus, it’s actually reasonable in the ballpark. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Kim of Imperial Capital. Your line is open. Michael Kim Hi. Good morning, guys. With regards to the device business and the partnerships that you’ve established, how should we think about per-unit royalties trending as volume scales? And then just in terms of total volume, do you see it returning closer to historical levels around, say 2 million units annually or closer to 1 million? John Chen I could answer the second. I cannot answer the first because the first question, first of all, it’s different with all three, and we have a different pricing, tiering model for the mix set, but I’m glad you mentioned something here. I want to clarify one point that I sneak into my script that now everybody’s going crazy around me. You don’t know. By the way, this is one of those like what is that, you kind of like the TV studio. While I’m talking to you, there’s a bunch of activities around me started to distract me And apparently one statement I make regarding tablet was people got very excited and wanted to know whether this is a PlayBook again or something, absolutely not. I’m not building any hardware. Other than Radar, sorry, other than Radar, I’m not building piece of hardware. One of our partners get very excited to build a tablet, which based on Android, and so -- and they wanted us to give them the portfolio rights to do that, and I’m interested in that because I’m going to get royalty for every piece of tablet they ship. So, I will just leave it at that, and it’s not even -- we have to QA it. We have to do a lot of things with it. So it’s not 100% committed thing, but it’s going to come from our partners, and BlackBerry will only receive royalty, but it’s using our software, and we do the QA and portfolio management. So, I hope that clarifies that point. So, in terms of unit count, I got three groups of people taking it worldwide. In the India market and definitely in the China market, in the Indonesian market, if you get all that and products across the world, I will be -- personally, I’d be disappointed if it’s 1 million units. I would think that -- I will help them to do more marketing on that. So, I really do believe that this is a multimillion unit a year situation. Michael Kim Great. That’s very helpful. And then just on Radar, I know you continue to ramp your go-to-market with six customer pilots, I think you mentioned for this fourth quarter and six in the previous quarter. Can you talk about how long the POCs are running and then your sense on conversions? John Chen Yes, usually, it’s three to six months, the POC and then about three months of the kind of contract negotiations and getting the orders and shipping. So, this is a six months to a nine months win or conversion into revenue. Michael Kim Got it. Thanks very much.  John Chen Thank you. Okay, I think we only have five minutes. So, okay, we could take one more, please. Operator Yes, sir. Our last question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Simona Jankowski Hi. Thank you very much. I just wanted to clarify one more time in terms of the as reported software and services segment, which includes the UEM and QNX revenues. Can you just comment on, since that was relatively flat sequentially, how both of those components trended on a sequential basis, QNX and UEM, were they up or down? John Chen Sequentially flat, they’re not sequentially flat at all. I know UEM had gained quite a bit. So… Steve Capelli The overall number -- I’m trying to go back to it. Simona Jankowski I was just talking about the as reported segment numbers, so not including that professional services piece out of the Mobility Solutions business. Steve Capelli In terms of relatively flat, I mean, your point’s well taken. I would attribute part of that to John made a reference to our billings were larger. And… John Chen On the deferred? I mean, not the deferred, subscription? Steve Capelli On the subscription revenue. So, we had an increase in the subscription that had that not taken place, you’d have seen a different set of numbers. John Chen Simona, I’m more focused on billings. Just like on the Radar, I’m more focused on the POC win because I know that’s future revenue. And so sorry that I didn’t know what you exactly meant. It was on the revenue number that you focused on. Simona Jankowski Yes, I just wanted to clarify that. And then the 13% to 15%, you commented that the base that you’re going to grow that off of includes that professional services piece that you just had in Mobility Solutions. Just so we know the full base for the full year, were there any other meaningful similar amounts in the full fiscal 2017 base that we should be aware of just as we think about that growth rate? John Chen No. As I said, the 13% to 15% is our overall number that 687 million or so, no, there is no other significant amount that you should think about. Steve Capelli On the services side, we said that that would be included, and you may recall there was a smaller number than that in Q3. But as John pointed out, we’re looking at that total software and services number. John Chen Simona, I never learned. I gave you guys 30% last time, I did it, and now I gave you another number. It’s really -- I think at this time, I’m going to poke myself in the eye. I’m going to stop giving any numbers in the future. Simona Jankowski Well, I think it’ll get clear with the new segments, but thank you very much. John Chen Okay. All right, then. Thank you for all of us to joining us. I’m sorry we’re out of time because I have to got to do our own town hall meeting. So, I appreciate you dialing in, and have a great day.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Steven Li of Raymond James. The line is open, sir. Steven Li Hi, John and Steve. John, a couple of quarters ago, you talk about continuing to harden the BlackBerry software and achieve DoD certifications. Can you give us an update on that? John Chen Yes. Let’s see. We have NIAP certification a quarter ago. So that’s done. I mean, that’s done for the 10.3.3. We released that. So that’s the latest and greatest. We have a further hardening of the products in the Android side, which I just spoke about. We released that also, codename Black Widow, and we continue to spend a lot of time and resources on further doing more certification and more hardening. But the immediate task has been done. Steven Li Great. And you expect both certifications to drive some licensing revenues for you in mobility solutions or do you see them mostly as upside, potential upside? John Chen I think, first of all, the NIAP certification and then also the FedRAMP certification is required to do business in the critical arena with at least for the United States government, and I think it’s acceptable to a lot of governments around the world after we pass in the U.S. standard. So, we have achieved all that. So, it is anchor to our federal business as a whole, both in the UEM side of the equation as well as the ad hoc side of the equation. So, it’s both. The answer to your question is really both. It’s baked into support our current businesses or growing our current businesses as well as winning new projects. We will also license it but where it’s applicable by law. Operator Thank you. Your next questions from Paul Steep of Scotia Capital. Paul Steep Great. John, could you talk a little bit and maybe as well, Steven, with SAF coming down, can you John on the NOC side, talk about how you think about repurposing this infrastructure? Obviously, huge investment, it’s critical. And then Steve, sort of tying into John’s response, how should we think about managing the cost down on that significant infrastructure? John Chen Good question. This is one that we work on continuously. First of all, we’re very proud of our infrastructure in NOCs and many components of NOCs, some of them have to do with security and some of them have to do with relay forwarding. So, where we make sense of the cost structure and how we spend the money, we will repurpose it. We have a number of ideas. I think it’s too premature for me to comment on it, but I would just confirm the fact that we will keep it for our customers because a lot of consumers in their critical infrastructure relied on it; it is a value add that only BlackBerry could bring to the market, but we will also repurpose it as the capacity of the SAF requirements are coming down. So, you asked the right question. I can’t provide you a more detailed answer because it’s still work in progress. Steve Capelli From a cost structure perspective, we have done some stair step measures over the past 12 to 18 months. And the current position that we’re in can still come down but at small levels. With our plans to repurpose, we don’t feel at this point in time there is a need to dramatically change the cost structure for SAF. Obviously, we will review that, should that become necessary. Operator Thank you. And our next question is from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Maynard Um So, if I grow your software business at a 13% to 15% pace, and I think you said your gross margin guidance was 70% for fiscal 2018, does that imply that you’re seeing a decline in your software gross margins in fiscal 2018 or maybe just walk through, where you’re seeing the biggest gross margin impact. Because I think it implies that you’re seeing some decline somewhere. John Chen No, I think it’s a balance of the portfolio. I think Steve said the 70% is where the Company is, and we’re now centering without kind of onetime thing. You remember that a quarter ago, we’re at 70%, but that was a benefit of the warranty side of the equation on devices when we get out of devices. So that’s a onetime thing. The normalized margin is in the mid-50% -- mid-60%. So I think the 65% is really good number for where we are in the portfolio and the percentage of the portfolio. And what Steve is talking about was we’re going to bring it up to 70%. We’re going to work ourselves improving. So, think about it, there are 500 basis point improvement overall in the Company that we’re expecting in FY ‘18. So it’s not a decline of any sort. Steve Capelli And as you look at our software and services businesses as it is today, those margins are 80%, and we expect obviously that same construction of revenue to still have roughly 80% as well. But the combination of all the factors would get us to about 70% for the entire year. Maynard Um Okay. Thanks. And then, can you just talk about the key drivers of that 13% to 15% growth? I think your core MDM and your QNX businesses are your two largest segments. I’m just curious whether you think you can grow those at or closer to those rates? Thank you. John Chen Yes. I think the -- depending on who you look at, I mean, I look at some IDC numbers and Gartner and all that and for the UEM space, and UEM space is broader than just that the EMM space. We look at that number next year that people kind of looking at it at about 10% to 12.5% depending on who you look at. We think we could do better than that. That’s one component of that or Carl thinks he could do better than that. I think it doesn’t matter. Sandeep has a pretty good plan in QNX and particularly going Radar, and that’s -- and I spoke about some of the new ideas like the vehicle portal. Vehicle portals are charged on per month basis per vehicle. So, they’re another recurring revenue; I hope we could build up. So, there is a combination of some current existing products, which we’re very proud of and some of the new stuff that’s coming in online. Not everything will work, as you all know, but I think we’ve got enough iron in the fire that the combination of that makes us feel comfortable we could grow at that numbers. Operator Thanks. Your next question is from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Tim Long Just a clarification and a question. Just trying to get to the software numbers for the quarter. Could you -- it looks like maybe $27 million was reallocated from the traditional reporting. Maybe it moved from Mobility Solutions to software. So, we see the $166 million in there in one of the tables. Can you just clarify what that is? And on the -- maybe answer that, and then I’ll come back with another. John Chen What was that? Steve Capelli He said, answer that; maybe I’ll come back with another. John Chen Oh, I thought we have only one question. Okay, I got it. Yes, that is professional services revenue that apply to helping customers to deploy some of their applications and building some of the applications. So, those are engineers in the mobility group. That’s why the revenue is being reported in the mobility group because the cost is also being reported in mobility group. But these are services and software. Tim Long Okay. So, this is a recurring business; this isn’t just something that happened in the quarter? John Chen We hope so. We hope we will recur it. You know that it ties to task and project and assignments. So, we do hope so. Tim Long Okay. And secondly, on the mobility and the device side, a decent quarter there. Could you just walk us through again the timing of when you think the licensing piece will have a material impact both on revenues and what it means for gross margins for that business? John Chen Yes. It’s a little bit of -- it kind of depends on how you and I define material. But, let me put it in the following way. We just launched two phones or our partners just -- or we helped our partners launch two phones, one in Indonesia, and that one is shipping already. The second one that TCL announced at the Mobile World Congress, which is the physical keyboard on an Android, that one is not going to be slated to ship until probably May timeframe. I think the first production - manufacturing production run is the end of April. So, the product looks pretty good, but the worldwide visibility is going to be later than May. We get it obviously on a quarterly basis on reported ship per unit. So, you could kind of think about that and model that and calculate that. So, from the Indonesia one, we should see -- starting to see some revenue this quarter, and it start ramping up. And that’s our general idea is to pipeline these and then keep growing, the numbers. So, I’d say probably towards the end of the year that you could see some numbers that are significant enough, but you’re going to start seeing some level of ramp up or we should be start seeing some level of ramp. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Gus Papageorgiou of Macquarie. Your line is open. Gus Papageorgiou Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just on Radar, I’m wondering if you can give us a bit of an update there. How many traders or can you give us indication how many traders you currently have on that platform? And what’s your goal for the year? John Chen I don’t have how many traders. You guys have how many traders? In the thousands, right? Steve Capelli Yes. John Chen I’m sorry. I didn’t add up how many traders. My focus had always been the proof of concept and the win, and the reason is everybody will order 500, 1,000, 2,000, those kind of numbers to start even if they have 25,000 trailers, which in this case that we won a trailer with it, they had 25,000 trailers and containers. So, I would say what I focus in on -- in the early orders, the initial orders that usually are much more modest, once they start rolling it out, they literally go then to order just in time. So, to me, it’s really not so much as how many do we have right now but how many are we winning. Gus Papageorgiou When do you think Radar will be material for your revenues, like will it be sometime this year or will it be… John Chen Yes, absolutely. This is a reasonably big piece of our growth plan of the Company that Sandeep is driving, yes. The answer to the question is yes. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Anil Doradla of William Blair. Your line is open. Anil Doradla Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So, John, just a clarification here. You talk about 13% to 15%; is that based on when you look at the software and services revenue, is that based on the $166 million, which is purely software or some of the reallocations which is going on, the $20 plus million, so that’s like $194 million? So, what are you basing that 15% -- 13% to 15% growth? John Chen I base on the whole thing. So, you guys keep thinking about reallocation. It is not reallocation; it is the people in that group doing software and services. This is why I have to redo the reporting because I think it’s misleading to you all. You all think about mobility solution. When we first put our mobility solution, we used the word mobility solution; we didn’t use the word device, okay? Because I knew this is our plan. Our plan is to get into licensing and get into services because we have a lot of great engineers. And so to remind everybody, these engineers are all QNX-based engineers. The reason is our BB10 was QNX-based. So, it’s not a reallocation, repurpose, whatever it is. It is growing as software business with our device business if that makes sense to people. And so yes, when I talk about 13% to 15%, I talk about as the whole of the software, including that piece. Anil Doradla Very good. And as a follow-up, we saw good drop-off in R&D. Can you explain and give some little bit more color, was it personnel-driven, tools, technology-driven, and how should we be looking at the prioritization in fiscal 2018 on the R&D front? John Chen I didn’t -- could you please repeat that? Steve Capelli Drop in R&D expense, wanted to know really what was behind that? John Chen There are many components. And I think in some areas, we were a little too heavy. Some of the -- we no longer design the hardware, antennas and keyboards and power and supply and all that. We don’t do those anymore. We no longer need engineers in the factories helping the devices -- building devices. So that’s the basic part of it. We also have consolidated some locations, and we also have using some of our overseas locations. So, there’s a combination of things to drive down the cost as a percentage spend on revenue. And so, we’re very focused on getting ourselves into a good model. Steve Capelli I also want to add that if you’re looking at our Mobility Solutions group, you see quite a large decline in that OpEx, and that’s really related to the fact that many of those people providing the services that John just spoke about and that their costs would be resting in COGS associated with the revenue as opposed to just an operating expense. Anil Doradla Great. And if I could squeeze one final thing, John, you’re talking about this new reporting structure to clarify some of this misunderstanding. So, is this just more of a front-end investor kind of presentation or in the backend, are you reorganizing the Company to support this kind of new reporting structure? John Chen We reorganize the company. Operator Our next question’s from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Meta Marshall Hi. This is Meta for James. Just a question on the Ford and QNX announcement yesterday about them hiring some of the QNX employees from BlackBerry, and so just wanted to get a sense of should that change how we think of the OpEx of BlackBerry going forward; and does this just reinforce the relationship, just a little bit about that announcement from yesterday? John Chen Well, first of all, they did not hire QNX engineer. There are some engineers that was hired from our mobility group, but the details I’m not going to comment on, on that particular report. All our numbers that we just provided have factored in everything. So, please don’t take the expense down further because like I have mentioned, and I think Steve mentioned, we actually have a headcount growth plan in mind, but that also is already factored in what we guided, which fits to the Street models on a consensus basis. Operator Our next one is from Paul Treiber of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Paul Treiber Hi. Thanks very much and good morning. Just regards to the professional services in Mobility Solutions, could you elaborate on the type of work that they are doing and then how that may lead to future software revenue or is it solely one-time without the potential for future software revenue? John Chen No. We are not a -- it is good question, thank you because this gave me a chance to clarify. All the work being done are aimed at selling licenses or to create royalty revenue of the future. So, we are not a body shop of any kind. Paul Treiber Okay. Thanks for clarifying. In regards to the agreement with Ford that the press release that you put out last year and in regards to the employees, generally speaking, what’s the opportunity for BlackBerry if an automaker makes a significant investment like Ford’s doing in QNX? And then is it more than just the ASP of the basic OS? John Chen Oh, yes. See, this is where -- first of all, a car is really a computer on the road or mobile computer on the road. And so, each component in it, if you remember, the company at BlackBerry started with a pretty dominant position in infotainment. So, if anyone of you have a 2016 model Ford or a Jaguar or a number of different cars, you are using BlackBerry software. So, the Ford 2016 model has our Sync 3; it’s on BlackBerry, and this is a public statement on both companies. So, I’m not giving you any proprietary information. So, Ford has decided and worked so well with us that they have decided to expand using our software. And then there are areas of telematics; there are areas of safety, ADAS areas, all of that, BlackBerry actually has and have offer in the market. And we continue to build new products and new modules and new ideas of like, for example, on the cyber security side I mentioned the portal management, a vehicle portal management. We hope Ford will take a very, very serious look at it. And with that, we could start having recurring revenue for ourselves and for Ford. We also have over-the-air technology that Ford’s very interested in. So, it’s a much more bigger than just a basic OS. It’s horizontal application; it’s how cars put together and how cars modules talk to each other. Future car is basically one huge program. So, I am very bullish, and this is only with Ford, and it is nonexclusive. So, if I could do more with others, other car manufacturers around the world, Europe, Asia that will be even better. Paul Treiber Just one follow-up to that. In regards to other automakers, I mean, what do you think the likelihood of winning agreements of a similar magnitude of Ford? John Chen Likely. Paul Treiber Okay. Thank you. John Chen We just need a little bit of time. We are pretty -- as we are recognized leader in this whole world and both in the QNX embedded software as well as in cyber, cyber security. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Todd Coupland of CIBC. Your line is now open. Todd Coupland Just a clarification on OpEx, and then I had a QNX question. So, are you saying on OpEx that the $190 million, plus or minus, is the baseline and that’ll grow some but revenue and margins will grow faster, which gets you to the operating leverage in 2018; is that the takeaway? John Chen Yes. That’s pretty much our model, yes. Todd Coupland Okay. So, my question on QNX and just the automotive opportunity. So, with respect to that last question, John, I get like all those pieces you’re working on. The one thing we’re struggling with is if you sort of stack all that up without giving us individual pricing on each one of those areas, when you think about sort of a per car opportunity for your business, how are you thinking about that? Is that over time, $10 per car, $50 per car? How are you thinking about it? John Chen Yes, I think about it. So, I’ll give you the current -- I’m not giving you the pricing of that. But if you look at our current infotainment systems, I think the street price is about $3 to $5 a car. That’s the Street price. So my competitors and myself and everybody is in that neighborhood. And if you stack these modules together, the ARPU should be 4, 5 times of that number. Now of course, now you have to do discount it, and you’ve got the volume wise it and then the new product that’s got coming out. So, I mean it’s just a normal type of business where you continue to enhance the offering, and each of the offering is a module, and you get royalty on that and then -- and one of the thing that I think is exciting for us is not that we’re done there, by the way. I just want to make sure that everybody understands. When I talk about a portal, a vehicle portal management, it’s kind of the next things that we’re focusing on is to generally recurring monthly revenue and all from these kind of the world of connected cars and the need to have enhanced security or constant monitoring of security and antihacking and malware. So, all the stuff that I talk about, all have a common theme in how we grow our business and our revenue. So rather than getting a set amount of dollars per car when we roll it out the manufacturing line, we want that too. We want that, and we want a higher ARPU of that, and we want a service component of that on a monthly basis. Todd Coupland And when you think about this business over the next, let’s say, three years, auto market globally is 100 million units. What’s a realistic market share for QNX? John Chen That’s a great question. I would tell you this. Infotainment, we own over half the market today, 60 million cars. So, I hope that give us some leverage and continue R&D, and this is why we created the autonomous driving car centers, innovation centers in Ottawa a quarter-plus ago because we wanted to attract partners with us to build application on our platform. People often asked me what I’m going to build an autonomous car. No, I’m not. I’m not building an autonomous car. I don’t want to compete with my customer, nor do I want to compete with very, very big name that wanted to spend hundreds of millions, if not billions in there. I’m not building any autonomous car. I am building the components that enable other people to build their autonomous car. And we created a platform in Ottawa. We welcome anybody who come in, and we have a lot of partners that come in and test out on our platform, and so they could work on their autonomous part of the car. Today, the connected car is a huge market as you all know. The autonomous car is probably going to be post-2020 so forth and so forth. I mean I’m getting too much into it, but we also we are very excited about this market. Operator Thank you. Your next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kulbinder Garcha Thank you. Just one clarification and one question. On the clarification, in the quarter, were there any major IP or patent sales onetime in nature or otherwise? John Chen No, our IP numbers are very small in the quarter. Kulbinder Garcha And then, basically for the full year then in 2018, what you guys sound like you say that software and services growth in that double-digit range of 13% to 15% maybe gross margin at 70%, and you should have OpEx from this run rate exiting the year going to be down or is it going to grow. Actually I missed that point. Can you clarify that part? John Chen Yes. As I said, I mean, I don’t want to make a single statement on one area because I think when we review the consensus model that you all have for Q1 and for the year, it looks quite reasonable. Interesting enough, when we roll out our numbers, it’s very close to your numbers. So that’s good. That’s goodness. So, we are going to grow our expenses because we have many areas that we would like to invest in. However, we are also going to reduce some of the areas. So, I think, by and large, the growth in expenses will be relatively modest throughout the year because we’re going to be taking some of the cost structure out, and we’re going to try to find ways to do things in much more efficient way and effective way and then invest the dollars. And we, in fact, you folks may not know this, but I’ll give you one stack. We actually have hired 1,000 people last year, and I know everybody’s going to ask me about that, right? But we have a pretty big feel now reach to the market, and we cover almost all the financial institutions in the G7 world, so to speak, and the governments. So, we have a pretty good execution in the field now. We have a very big customer support team that is more customer-facing than in the professional services. But in the meantime, we have shifted away -- our G&A came down quite a bit and headcount. So, it’s just that way of also rationalizing where we put our money and where the number is. So, if you go back to model, that is now consensus, it’s actually reasonable in the ballpark. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Kim of Imperial Capital. Your line is open. Michael Kim Hi. Good morning, guys. With regards to the device business and the partnerships that you’ve established, how should we think about per-unit royalties trending as volume scales? And then just in terms of total volume, do you see it returning closer to historical levels around, say 2 million units annually or closer to 1 million? John Chen I could answer the second. I cannot answer the first because the first question, first of all, it’s different with all three, and we have a different pricing, tiering model for the mix set, but I’m glad you mentioned something here. I want to clarify one point that I sneak into my script that now everybody’s going crazy around me. You don’t know. By the way, this is one of those like what is that, you kind of like the TV studio. While I’m talking to you, there’s a bunch of activities around me started to distract me And apparently one statement I make regarding tablet was people got very excited and wanted to know whether this is a PlayBook again or something, absolutely not. I’m not building any hardware. Other than Radar, sorry, other than Radar, I’m not building piece of hardware. One of our partners get very excited to build a tablet, which based on Android, and so -- and they wanted us to give them the portfolio rights to do that, and I’m interested in that because I’m going to get royalty for every piece of tablet they ship. So, I will just leave it at that, and it’s not even -- we have to QA it. We have to do a lot of things with it. So it’s not 100% committed thing, but it’s going to come from our partners, and BlackBerry will only receive royalty, but it’s using our software, and we do the QA and portfolio management. So, I hope that clarifies that point. So, in terms of unit count, I got three groups of people taking it worldwide. In the India market and definitely in the China market, in the Indonesian market, if you get all that and products across the world, I will be -- personally, I’d be disappointed if it’s 1 million units. I would think that -- I will help them to do more marketing on that. So, I really do believe that this is a multimillion unit a year situation. Michael Kim Great. That’s very helpful. And then just on Radar, I know you continue to ramp your go-to-market with six customer pilots, I think you mentioned for this fourth quarter and six in the previous quarter. Can you talk about how long the POCs are running and then your sense on conversions? John Chen Yes, usually, it’s three to six months, the POC and then about three months of the kind of contract negotiations and getting the orders and shipping. So, this is a six months to a nine months win or conversion into revenue. Michael Kim Got it. Thanks very much.  John Chen Thank you. Okay, I think we only have five minutes. So, okay, we could take one more, please. Operator Yes, sir. Our last question is from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Simona Jankowski Hi. Thank you very much. I just wanted to clarify one more time in terms of the as reported software and services segment, which includes the UEM and QNX revenues. Can you just comment on, since that was relatively flat sequentially, how both of those components trended on a sequential basis, QNX and UEM, were they up or down? John Chen Sequentially flat, they’re not sequentially flat at all. I know UEM had gained quite a bit. So… Steve Capelli The overall number -- I’m trying to go back to it. Simona Jankowski I was just talking about the as reported segment numbers, so not including that professional services piece out of the Mobility Solutions business. Steve Capelli In terms of relatively flat, I mean, your point’s well taken. I would attribute part of that to John made a reference to our billings were larger. And… John Chen On the deferred? I mean, not the deferred, subscription? Steve Capelli On the subscription revenue. So, we had an increase in the subscription that had that not taken place, you’d have seen a different set of numbers. John Chen Simona, I’m more focused on billings. Just like on the Radar, I’m more focused on the POC win because I know that’s future revenue. And so sorry that I didn’t know what you exactly meant. It was on the revenue number that you focused on. Simona Jankowski Yes, I just wanted to clarify that. And then the 13% to 15%, you commented that the base that you’re going to grow that off of includes that professional services piece that you just had in Mobility Solutions. Just so we know the full base for the full year, were there any other meaningful similar amounts in the full fiscal 2017 base that we should be aware of just as we think about that growth rate? John Chen No. As I said, the 13% to 15% is our overall number that 687 million or so, no, there is no other significant amount that you should think about. Steve Capelli On the services side, we said that that would be included, and you may recall there was a smaller number than that in Q3. But as John pointed out, we’re looking at that total software and services number. John Chen Simona, I never learned. I gave you guys 30% last time, I did it, and now I gave you another number. It’s really -- I think at this time, I’m going to poke myself in the eye. I’m going to stop giving any numbers in the future. Simona Jankowski Well, I think it’ll get clear with the new segments, but thank you very much. John Chen Okay. All right, then. Thank you for all of us to joining us. I’m sorry we’re out of time because I have to got to do our own town hall meeting. So, I appreciate you dialing in, and have a great day. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes your program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

( BEAS ) F4Q08 (Qtr End 1/31/08) Earnings Call February 28, 2008  5:00 PM ET Executives Kevin Faulkner - VP of IR Alfred Chuang - Founder, Chairman and CEO Mark Dentinger - CFO Operator Ladies and Gentlemen, good afternoon. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BEA Systems fourth quarter and year-end 2008 conference call. During this call all participants will be in a listen-only mode and today's conference call is being recorded. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Faulkner, BEA's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir Kevin Faulkner Thank you, Michael. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us as we discussed BEA Systems, Inc. results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 2008. Please note we've posted our earnings press release and the related financial tables on our website at bea.com. Statements made in the course of this conference call that are not of historical fact are forward-looking statements, including any statements regarding the plans, goals, strategies, opportunities and objectives for our business. In addition, statements that include the use of the terminology such as may, will, expects, plans, estimates, continue, predict, growth or other comparable terminology are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements also include statements regarding future financial performance, future products, features or innovation, customer adoption of BEA products, the proposed merger with Oracle Corporation, the effect of the proposed merger on our distribution and business, and any statements of assumptions underlying any other foregoing. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Such factors include those factors detailed in item 1-A Risk Factors in BEA's reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2007, and similar disclosures in subsequent SEC filings. The forward-looking statements and risks stated in this conference call are based on information available to BEA today. BEA assumes no obligation to update them. Now, I'd like to introduce from BEA Alfred Chuang, who is Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Dentinger, Chief Financial Officer. Alfred and Mark will make some prepared remarks, but we will not have a question-and-answer session on today's call. With that, I'm pleased to introduce and turn the call over to Alfred Chuang. Go ahead, Alfred. Alfred Chuang Thanks, Kevin. Thank you for joining us today. As you're all aware, during Q4, BEA announced that we enter into an agreement to merger Oracle. Over the last six weeks, I had an opportunity to talk to many customers, partners, and employees, and received positive feedback on the combination. Customers are excited as I am about the opportunity for combined BEA and Oracle to accelerate innovation in application and service infrastructure. BEA has built an amazing set of products, and our customers have used those products to power some of the most innovative business solutions. By combining with Oracle, we can have access to a larger global footprint of sales and services professionals, to help even more customers meet their business needs. The proposed combination creates a very exciting opportunity for our customers, partners, and also employees. The agreement was announced during the great quarter. In Q4, we delivered our best license performance ever. We had a very strong December close, and that was followed by a very solid January as well. Our Q4 results demonstrate that customers continue to adopt BEA technology as a foundation of their SOA architectures, and they continue to share our vision about the next-generation of enterprise computing. Congratulations to the team for maintaining the focus on customer success and execution. We had very solid Q4 and FY'08 results. In the fourth quarter, we returned to year-over-year license revenue growth. Total license revenue was up 13% over last year’s Q4. AquaLogic sustained its contribution level at a record 27% of license revenue. Services revenue continued a strong growth, up 17% over a year ago. We have record operating cash flow. Q4 included a solid year. Total revenue grew 10%. Maintenance revenue grew 18%. We generated $367 million in operating cash flow, by far our best year. We added $28 million to our deferred revenues and $25 million to our off balance sheet license backlog. We improved a non-GAAP operating margin by 200 basis points, outperforming our goal of the year. Let me turn over to Mark now, first to give you details on Q4 and fiscal 2008 results. Then I'll return to talk more about our business. We will not be providing Q&A guidance due to the pending merger. Mark? Mark Dentinger Thank you, Alfred. Our merger with Oracle is subject to both regulatory and shareholder approval, and my comments do not address what effect the merger announcement had on our Q4 results nor what effect it may have on our future results. Because of uncertainty during dependency period, we will not be taking any questions on this call, nor will we be issuing any guidance about out future financial performance. If you have questions about my prepared remarks, please contact our investor relation group. With respect to certain financial data discussed today and corresponding data, presented material posted on our website is helpful to understand the following framework about our results. Non-GAAP presentations of our financial results of operations are derived directly from our GAAP statements. Our standard non-GAAP adjustments are based on the conventions of most businesses in our industry, and exclude the following from GAAP earnings; FAS 123(NYSE: R ) expenses on stock option issuances and discounts on employee stock purchase plan; in-process R&D and amortization of deferred compensation and other intangibles associated with acquisitions; and any income or expense items which are not expected to be recurring, such as gains or losses on a impairment or disposal of assets, restructurings and unusual tax items. These standard non-GAAP adjustments are shown in our publication called Quarter in Review, which is posted on our website. Additionally, three other phenomena, the restatement of our financials; 409A taxes, and advisor fees associated with the merger are affecting our current and recent GAAP earnings, which we do not expect to be a part of our long-term cost structure. Therefore, our non-GAAP earnings also exclude following expenses: any restatement charges or credits impacting our reported results for the last two year; third party expenses associated with completing the stock option investigation and restatement; non-cash charges for modifying stock awards and cash bonuses paid to employees in Q4 fiscal 2007, both of which were designed to mitigate the impact on our employees from not being able to sell their stock during the restatement period; advisory and legal fees arising from activities leading up to our announced merger with Oracle; and payment to employees, former employees and tax agencies to remedy our current former employees' exposure to 409A taxes. These additional non-GAAP adjustments are shown in the publication Supplement Quarter in Review, which is also posted on our website. With this framework in mind, let me start by discussing our non-GAAP income statement results. Revenue for the quarter was $440.9 million, up 13% year-over-year. License revenue was $179.5 million or 41% of total revenue, and services revenue was $261.4 million or 59% of total revenue. License revenue increased by 6% from last year's Q4 and services revenue increased 17%. The largest component of services revenue customer support was $206 million, an 18% increase compared to last year's Q4. Consulting and education revenues were $56 million in Q4, up 15% from last year. Geographically, the Americas region generated 48% of our Q4 revenue, which is down four percentage points from last year's Q4. Internationally, our EMEA business contributed 36% of total revenues, a two percentage point improvement from a year ago, and Asia-Pacific was 16% of revenues, a 2 point improvement from last year. By product, the AquaLogic family contributed 27% of our Q4 licensed revenue, versus 25% in Q4 of last year. The WebLogic and Tuxedo families contributed 73% of our licensed revenue in Q4, versus 75% Q4 of last year. Q4 total license transaction count of 2,531 decreased approximately 3% from last year, and our average transaction size increased by approximately 9%. For Q4, industry vertical performance was as follows. Government was 20% of licensed revenue, telecommunications was 16%, software was 14%, banking and finance was 11%. Other verticals were individually less than 10% of licensed revenues for the quarter. Our aggregate backlog at January 31, 2008 is $558 million, and includes deferred revenue from unexpired maintenance contracts, $449 million; deferred revenue from undelivered consulting and education orders, $23 million; deferred revenue for license orders which have shipped but have not met revenue recognition requirements, $5 million; off balance sheet license orders received but not shipped, $35 million; and off balance sheet services orders received and not delivered, $46 million. Our aggregate backlog at January 31, 2007 was $500 million, of which $449 was included on our balance sheet as deferred revenue. We did not believe that off balance sheet backlog as of any particular date directly co-relates to future results. As noted -- also note that our off balance sheet backlog is not subject to our normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in, or derived from, our basic financial statements. Finally, the concept of backlog is not to find any accounting literature, making comparisons with other company is difficult and potentially misleading. Now, let me address costs and expenses. Non-GAAP costs of licenses were 5.4% of license revenue in Q4, up from 4.8% in Q4 of last year. Cost of services was 28.8% of services revenue, compared to 29.5% Q4 of last year. Total operating expenses for Q4 were $236.7 million or 53.7% of total revenue, compared with $225.4 million in Q4 of last year or 57.5% of total revenue. Sales and marketing expense was $146.5 million or 33.2% of total revenue in Q4, compared with $138.8 million or 35.4% last year. R&D expense was 13.2% of revenue in Q4, compared to 14.4% of revenue in Q4 of last year. G&A expenses, at 7.3% of revenue in Q4, were down from 7.7% of revenue last year. Our Q4 non-GAAP operating profit was $119.3 million compared with $92.5 million a year ago. Expressed as a percentage our Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 27.1%, up from 23.6% a year ago. Our non-GAAP other income and expense, or OIE, increased to $15.6 million in Q4 versus $10.4 million in Q4 of last year. The OIE improvement was largely the result of reduced interest expense on our line-of-credit borrowings. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 27.5% of pre-tax non-GAAP income in Q4 compared to 34.4% in Q4 of last year. We expect our intermediate-term non-GAAP tax rate to approximate 27% to 29% based upon current earnings distribution, but the quarterly rate can fluctuate based upon specific items that arise or settle in each period. After making the previously mentioned non-GAAP adjustments, fourth quarter net income on a non-GAAP basis was $0.23 per share or $97.8 million, versus $0.16 a share in Q4 of last year. A fully-diluted weighted average shares outstanding used in our Q4 '08 EPS calculation was 423.5 million, and the share number used in last year Q4 non GAAP EPS calculation was 414 million. Our Q4 result would have been approximately 4% lower in total revenue, 3% lower in cost of revenues, and 3% lower in operating expenses, if we translated the current quarter at currency exchange rate in effect last year. We were also profitable on a GAAP basis during Q4, recording fully-diluted EPS of $0.18, compared to $0.25 per share of loss in Q4 of last year. The large GAAP loss in last year's Q4 resulted from $200 million asset impairment write-down on vacant property in San Jose headquarters, which was sold in Q1 of fiscal of '08. Part of our GAAP earnings in Q4 of fiscal '08, we absorbed the following additional pre tax charges--$1.5 million for external expenses associated with the options investigation and restatement; advisory and legal expenses of $10.3 million for merger related activities; approximately $3 million in charges for stock repricing which is part of the Q4 tender offered to employees impacted by 409A, and approximately $2.8 million for payments to former employees and tax agencies to remedy 409A issues. Now, let me address our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with total cash investments of about of about $1.5 billion, and we generated $123 million in cash flow from operations during Q4. In the same quarter last year, our operating cash flow was negative $3 million, largely because of a one-time $99 million reclassification out of operating cash flow and into cash flows financing activity. As discussed last quarter, this reclassification results from adopting FAS 123( R ) in fiscal 2007, combined with the fact that BEA drew down evaluation results against deferred taxes assets for the first in Q4 of '07. Had we not recorded the one-time adjustment, cash flow from operations in last year's Q4 would have been $95 million. DSO at the end of Q4 was 81 days, compared with 91 days at the end of Q4 of last year. Our deferred revenue balance was $477 million at the end of Q4, compared with $449 million at the end of Q4 of last year. Total headcount was essentially unchanged during Q4, and we exited the quarter with 4,117 employees. Thank you for joining us today, and now let me turn it back to Alfred. Alfred Chuang Thanks Mark. So, now, let me give some of my thoughts on our Q4 and fiscal 2008 results. In Q4, every geographic region hit the budget and grew year-over-year. Asia-pacific continues to the lead the way, with 45% growth in license orders. China, continue to deliver strong growth. We also had strong performances in ASEAN, India, and Australia and New Zealand. We continue to view Asia-Pacific as a leading growth opportunity. Our performance in Americas was led by the North Central region, South Central region, Federal and Latin America. Our EMEA performance was led by the U.K and Spain. EMEA delivered a strong performance in May budget, inspired by two large deals that slipped late in the quarter. Demand for our products was very strong in Q4. Tuxedo had a big Q4, and grew slightly for the full year. WebLogic Server performance improved in Q4 as well. Customers for our foundational technologies included ALTEC, eHarmony, Intec Billing and Research in Motion. Portal and BPM continue to provide the interface to SOA projects. Our SOA, our portal business, grew 11%, two percentage points faster than industry analysts estimate the portal is growing. AquaLogic BPM sustained the last year's momentum, delivering 47% growth this year. Portal and BPM customers in the quarter included Cingular Wireless, Petroleo Brasileiro, Research in Motion, ScrewFix and Vertex Pharmaceuticals. For the last few years, we've talked about SOA Governance and Integration as a key trend. Those trends continue to drive customer's option of BEA technology in Q4. Our AquaLogic integration products delivered 18% growth for the year. In Q4, SOA Governance revenue once again doubled year-over-year. For the full fiscal year, SOA Governance delivered 140% growth. SOA Governance and Integration customers in Q4 included Cigna, Comagas, Sempra Energy, TIAA-CREF, United Airlines and Vivo. WebLogic communication platform had the best bookings quarter ever. The market emphasis on opening up networks to third-party content provides as well as the integration of communication with Web 2.0 provides an important market opportunity for WLCP. In addition, this quarter we saw a market opportunity, we did not expect for WLCP. One of our large customers is rewriting software from their core network onto the WebLogic SIP Server. We expect the WLCP to serve next-generation voice, video and data networks. But we did not expect Telcos to migrate core network elements. This customer, in conjunction with BEA and one of our customers, is building software-driven smart switches in the hardware network. Migrating their Class 4 switches to Linux Blade servers, WLCP customers in the quarter included France Telecom, Alcatel, Italtel, and a large US carrier. In addition, we continue to make progress with our new Virtualization products. In Q4, we announced WebLogic Liquid Operations Control, a management suite that goes with WebLogic Logic Server Virtualization Edition. We also shipped a new version of the WLS Virtue Edition, which tests have shown can actually run a virtualized application faster than a physical application. We have received several orders for CPOs, and the pipeline grew dramatically after the release of the new version of the product. Yesterday at VMware EMEA, BEA and VMware announced the distribution partnership, where BEA Virtualization technology will be embedded in VMware products. Let me give you more details on how customers are using our products. Dell Computer is undergoing a major transformation as an organization. To drive the transformation, Dell is building an enterprise-wide SOA platform accessed by all the company's major business units, based on BEA’s technology. Dell underwent a rigorous competitive evaluation, and selected BEA as a primary technology for this new platform. Dell purchased the entire AquaLogic product family, as well as our Virtualization technology. Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a global biotechnology company committed to the discovery and development of breakthrough small molecule drugs for serious disease, focusing on bio diseases, cancer, autoimmune disease and bacterial infections. Vertex selected AquaLogic use interaction and BPM Suite as a platform for collaboration with researchers in both research and regulatory approval process. eHarmony, the online dating site is siphoning 70 million registered users, and growing in excess of 45% annually. They selected BEA as a foundation because of the scalability, reliability, and performance that are crucial to user experience, as well as the ability to seamlessly implement application upgrades. United Airlines chose BEA as partners as they move forward with a major new SOA initiative. United is in an increasingly competitive environment requiring great agility, and an improved ability to innovate and meet the evolving needs of traveling public. With enterprise-wide SOA initiative powered by Weblogic Server, Weblogic portal and the complete AquaLogic product family, United will provide such unique offerings as self-served baggage tracking, and automated upsell award redemption system. This system exceeded 1,500 transactions per second during the proof-of-concept process. SOA Governance will be used throughout the lifecycle of this initiative. This initiative is designed to allow United's IT departments to drive measurable results for the business, in the form of reduced costs, minimized risk and much faster time to market. La Caixa is a major savings bank in Spain, and one of the largest in Europe, with around 10 million customers, and more than 5,000 branches, as one of the most successful online banking systems in Spain, which has been powered by Weblogic Server since it was launched in 2000. As part of a global strategy to reengineer software architecture and application for its branches, La Caixa decided to replace an existing high TCO infrastructure with an extension of the WebLogic Server environment aided by BEA Consulting Services. BEA won this architectural deal in competition with IBM. As an early lead in SOA, we can see that SOA is in the first step of the journey to the creation of a new class of dynamic business applications that will enable enterprises to innovate much more quickly. Enterprises have spent billions of dollars installing packaged software applications, only to find that the standardized business logic inside merely accelerates their path to becoming average. True business innovation is happening outside the packaged application, and BEA is at the forefront of enabling enterprises, ISVs, to design a new breed of dynamic business applications. The first phase of Project Genesis, BEA's initiative to deliver a dynamic business application platform, is scheduled to ship in the middle of this year. Now, let me comment on the proposed merger with Oracle. Yesterday, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino review period for the proposed merger. Also, as recently announced, BEA has scheduled a special meeting of stockholders to consider and vote on the proposed merger. The meeting is scheduled to be held at 10 am Pacific time on Friday, April 4, 2008. The transaction will require BEA stockholder approval and regulatory clearances from the European Commission, and is subject to other closing conditions. BEA and Oracle are working towards obtaining all required clearances as soon as possible. Before I conclude, let me summarize. Here is what I see as key themes of the quarter and our financial results. First, we delivered a record quarter and returned to license revenue growth. Second, customers continue to adopt BEA technology as a platform for SOA and other major enterprise projects, and share our vision for dynamic business applications, the next generation of enterprise computing beyond SOA. Third, we've continued to make significant improvements in our operating efficiency reflected in both our operating margins and our operating cash flows. We believe in our strategy, future prospects and ability to execute. During this time, as the merge with Oracle is pending regulatory review and shareholder approval, the Company is focused on executing our growth strategy, improving our operating model and making our customers successful. This concludes our call. Thank you very much for joining us today. Operator Once again, thank you all very much for joining us. That does conclude today's presentation. Have a great afternoon.

Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Hello, everybody, and thank you for joining today's call. Earlier today, we announced that Jennifer will become CEO of Baidu Capital, an investment firm. Jennifer will transition away from her responsibilities as CFO, following the appointment of her successor. Jennifer has played an instrumental role in Baidu's growth over the nine years she has been our CFO. And as CEO of Baidu Capital, she will continue to be part of the Baidu family and contribute to building Baidu's ecosystem, which is crucial in bringing AI to real world applications. Jennifer's extensive experience in the area of finance, capital markets, technology, auto, financial services, and consumer industries will help bridge technology as well as traditional industries. And I look forward to working with Jennifer in her new capacity. Now, turning to the quarter. I will begin with a few brief comments, and then Qi will provide a business review, and Jennifer will present the financials. 2017 is shaping up to be a transformational year for Baidu, as we complete our strategic evolution to China's largest AI-centric technology company. We believe that a great technological revolution comparable to the industrial revolution is taking shape, representing a once-in-a generation opportunity that will create new commercial frontiers and transform a wide range of industries, such as auto, healthcare, education, financial services, and industrial automation. In the AI enabled era, the scenarios for human machine interaction will be much broader than what we've seen before. And as natural language understanding and image recognition power new information gateways, the new paradigms for human machine interaction will have significant implications for how people conduct their daily lives. I'm confident that Baidu's advantages in technology, specifically advanced AI research will position us to be the industry leader for the long-term. Search is one of the first applications of AI where search works to understand human. As the leading search engine in China, we have been fortunate to amass vast amounts of rich, valuable data in a market with over 700 million Internet users who speak the same language, have the same culture, and abide by the same laws. Moreover, we live in an age where we can finally match this data with powerful efficient computing infrastructure, and a deep bench of talent to make real progress in AI. We believe Baidu's opportunity to apply AI to real world consumer and enterprise applications in China is enormous. We envision a world where machines continue to learn about humans. In the not so distant future, using natural voice input or images to interact with machines will be mainstream, alleviating humans of the burden of mutant tasks. We imagine a world where your face is your identity and you only need to show your face to pay at the supermarket or goes through airport security. Cars will drive us, freeing up our time and attention. As machines become more like hyper efficient, real-time assistants for people, the mode of user interaction is evolving correspondingly. Just as the mouse and keyboard were the gateways in the PC era and touch is the gateway for mobile, voice recognition through conversational DuerOS will be the gateway in the China plus AI era. Our investment in AI is a long-term proposition with dividends that will be paid over the medium to long term. We're already seeing the powerful benefit of AI in our existing online advertising platform and in a more personalized, more image enhanced and more predictive search experience. Beyond the existing PC and mobile channels, AI will expand the scenarios and use cases for search in home, car, and work, and lower the friction for search through voice recognition, image recognition, and user personalization. Our strategy is clear and we're working hard on multiple fronts. I'll now turn the call over to Qi to go through our business progress. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Robin. To build on Robin's key points, operationally here at Baidu, we very much focus on building and applying AI technologies as the foundation of what we do, and the primary driver of product innovation and business growth. Over the past three months, I have spent the majority of my time working with our product and business teams to map out our strategy and the ways to drive high-performance execution. Our focus is two-fold, to enhance and expand our existing core business platform, and to lead the commercialization of AI technology across a number of AI-enabled new business initiatives, such as our AI-cloud, financial services, DuerOS, and autonomous driving. For our new business initiatives, we have gone through a rigorous and disciplined process to evaluate and select the most promising new business opportunities to pursue. Our criteria includes, category lifecycle, market penetration, Baidu's competitive position, differentiated value propositions, and our ability to execute. We will be shedding more light on the process and the progress of these new business initiatives, and sharing operating metrics as appropriate as we move forward. On our core business front, we are off to a good start, driving improvements in both traditional core search, as well as in our news feed product. Search is and will continue to be a fundamental user need, especially as we digitize more and more world information in our daily lives. We see much more room for innovation to deliver a better user experience with richer information using interactions as we expand search into more and more scenarios. For example, we are making great strides in enriching our search results, especially with video. In fact, now over 25% of mobile queries have rich video content as part of the search results, representing a material increase over last year. We are also making our search experience on mobile devices more natural and easy to navigate using touch. The experience is much more engaging, like that of our mobile native apps as compared to the traditional browser-based experience. This is achieved through intelligent filtering and the presentation technologies, based on our AI capabilities, in content and user intent understanding especially in more advanced areas, such as classification and object recognition in images and videos. With the twin engines of search and news feed, we have broadened our core product experience by complementing the explicit intent-driven, pull experience of the traditional search with implicit user understanding-driven, push experience of news feed. While we are pleased with the rapid user adoption of our news feed product with daily active users reaching 83 million this month, and the overall volumes of content distributions and the user time spent reaching a new weekly high, we will stay laser-focused on improving the user experience and building out our content platform, especially the number of content creators on our Baijiahao content platform has surpassed 450,000, more than doubling over last quarter, becoming an increasingly important part of the Baidu overall information ecosystem. Now, speak of ecosystem. Maps, Nuomi, and the Local Express continue to play a vital role in connecting users with local content and services, and helping local businesses connect with users through our search, feed and advertising products. Operationally in Q1, we consolidated Nuomi into our core business. Going forward, our focus for Nuomi will be building more and a better content of our local services and the monetization through advertising through Local Express, instead of just transactional business. All of these improvements to our core products and ecosystem are reflected in the growing engagement of our users, with the ratio of mobile search daily active users to monthly active users showing a clear upward trend. On the commercial product front, we added upgrades to our search ad platform, making click to connect ad formats available across search, Union and the news feed. This has yielded a notable lift in monetization. We are also actively developing and applying AI technologies across a number of key areas such as ad targeting, creative and landing page optimization, which will contribute to increasing monetization capabilities over time. While monetization is still at an early stage for news feed, customer feedback has been very positive, they view news feed traffic as incremental to their campaigns. Late last year, we also launched a dedicated news feed ad platform to complement news feed bidding within our search ad platform, and customer campaigns through this dedicated channel is ramping up at a rapid rate. Now turning to AI-enabled and new business initiatives. We are making good strides across the board, and here a few specific areas to call out. DuerOS is our next-generation conversational AI platform. By design, it provides powerful capabilities to enable the use of voice in natural language to interact with any digital experience on any device, for any scenario. This is because for the first time in our history, AI technology enables natural language to serve as a general purpose user interface. While it is still early, this platform will have enormous potential relative to the traditional platforms, because it can run everywhere, and it enable users to interact naturally and easily. We believe we are the clear market leader in China. DuerOS has already gained great momentum in building out its ecosystem. For example, we have secured broad partnership to power conversational AI services for Xiaomi and the Vivo smartphones, Lenovo smart TV, Haier, and Midea smart appliances, HARMAN smart speakers and many others across rapidly growing number of devices. Home and cars are two high value scenarios to anchor the DuerOS platform at this early phase. Here we have made important investments in our Raven Tech acquisitions, as well as our Internet of Vehicles business unit. Both of which will help further establish the DuerOS platform and strengthen our market leadership position. At the same time, both in their own right will have significant business opportunities that we will grow into. In Q1, we consolidate our L4 and L3 and Internet of Vehicle Business Unit into the new IDG, Intelligent Driving Group. This will enable us to build out a common technology platform, shared services, and a consistent solution for all our partners. At the Shanghai Auto Fair last week, we announced project Apollo, an open, complete, and reliable autonomous driving technology platform that we plan to launch in July. This is a historical opportunity to apply our AI technology strength to create an open innovation ecosystem that will empower all parties in the auto industry to accelerate the pace of innovation, enable more win-win partnerships, create greater business opportunities in this vast and rapidly growing market. The response from the industry and our partners has been very positive thus far. It is a big step forward. Our AI-cloud business named as ABC or AI Big Data and Cloud has been gaining traction with our customers, who appreciate our AI value-added approach. Baidu Cloud builds upon foundation of cloud solutions of computing, storage and CDN. We differentiate by providing AI technology enabled solutions, such as Big Data, deep learning, video, IoT and more. Customers across media, financial services, healthcare and other verticals have expressed very positive feedback. This month at the Baidu Cloud ABC summit, together with NVIDIA, we announced the establish of the Baidu Deep Learning platform which will greatly help our customers and partners to enhance their capability in Deep Learning and AI. Our Financial Services business continues to grow as our AI and Big Data capabilities serve as key differentiators that can intelligently target and match users with the right products, identify and prevent fraud and appropriately assess credit risk through our continuously increasing proprietary data and modeling capabilities. iQiyi, which celebrated its seventh anniversary this month, continued its sector leadership with ongoing improvements in revenue and paid subscriber numbers. In March, according to iResearch, iQiyi's mobile app maintained its top ranking with 129 million daily active users, 490 million monthly active users, and 342 billion minutes of monthly user time. We will continue to work closely with iQiyi to support its growth as part of the overall Baidu ecosystem. Baidu Deliveries with its first rate service quality and clear technology advantage made a strong progress in the quarter, seeing healthy revenue growth year-over-year. In March, during the International Women's Week, Baidu Deliveries ran a highly successful special joint promotion with Yum China's KFC and the Pizza Hut brands. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our progress in Q1, and we are more confident and energized about using AI to elevate our core products and the business and to create long-term values through our next-generation AI enabled new business initiatives. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to go through the financials. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Qi. Hello, everyone. In the first quarter, we bought back about $200 million of our own stock. We are very confident in Baidu's long-term outlook, and this decision is consistent with our overall capital allocation framework. We had a solid first quarter with the business performing to our expectations. As we're moving from mobile first to AI first, we work to align our business operations by folding Nuomi into our core business. Nuomi will play a role to serve as part of the core business' content and service ecosystem. We'll continue to scale back spend for Nuomi, and shift Nuomi from a take-rate transaction based business model to an advertising-based business model, which leverages our core business. We do not expect Nuomi to be a significant contributor to margin drag going forward. Other components in Transaction Services such as Maps, Financial Services, and Baidu Deliveries are also part of our core businesses content and service ecosystem, with Financial Services and Baidu Deliveries very much leveraging our AI capabilities. Baidu Deliveries continues to show improving operational efficiency, and a visible path to sustainability and profitability. Consistent with our strategic and operational focus to build our core business and invest in AI, we intend to realign our segment reporting, and fold Transaction Services into our core business. Starting next quarter, we'll report Baidu Core as a whole and Transaction Services will no longer be a separate segment. As Robin and Qi have shared, and as we have been communicating to you in the past few quarters, AI is the core of our strategy, and is both the foundation of our existing platform and driver of vast opportunities going forward. We are continuously leveraging our existing technology capabilities, and devoting resources to our AI-enabled initiatives of enterprise cloud, financial services, DuerOS and autonomous driving. The majority of these investments are on the R&D front, which we expect to bear fruit in the medium to longer term. This year, we expect incremental R&D expenses over 2016 to be all related to AI. Incremental R&D spend this year is largely related to AI R&D head count. As a reminder, as disclosed in our 20-F form, we disposed of our mobile gaming business for RMB 1.2 billion, a transaction which is expected to close mid-May. After mid-May, we will no longer recognize revenue for the mobile gaming business. The mobile gaming business contributed close to 3% of total revenue in 2016. Now moving to the financials, all monetary amounts are in RMB unless otherwise stated. For the first quarter, total revenues were RMB 16.9 billion, representing a 6.8% increase from the corresponding period in 2016. During the first quarter, Baidu had approximately 451,000 active online marketing customers, representing a 23% decrease from the corresponding period in 2016 and flat compared to the previous quarter. Revenue per online marketing customer for the first quarter was RMB 32,200, a 27% increase from the corresponding period in 2016, and a 9% decrease compared to the prior quarter. Traffic acquisition cost as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 was RMB 2.2 billion, representing a 12.9% of total revenues compared to 14.1% in the corresponding period in 2016, and 14.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Bandwidth costs as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 were RMB 1.3 billion, representing 7.9% of total revenues compared to 6.9% in the corresponding period in 2016. Depreciation costs as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 were RMB 823 million, representing 4.9% of total revenues compared to 4.5% in Q1 of 2016. Operational costs as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 were RMB 959 million, representing 5.7% of total revenue compared to 6.9% in Q1 last year. Content costs as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 were RMB 2.6 billion, representing 15.6% of total revenue, compared to 8.7% in the corresponding period in 2016. This increase was mainly due to iQiyi's increased content costs. SG&A expenses in Q1 were RMB 2.8 billion, representing a decrease of 29% from corresponding period in 2016. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in promotional spending for transaction services. R&D expenses in Q1 were RMB 2.8 billion, a 35% increase over the corresponding period in 2016. The increase was mainly due to growth of R&D personnel related expenses. Share-based compensation expenses, which were allocated to related operating and expense line items, increased in aggregate to RMB 631 million in Q1 from RMB 309 million in the corresponding period in 2016. This year-over-year increase was a result of increased share grants to employees. Operating profit for Q1 was RMB 2 billion, representing a 9.3% decrease from the corresponding period in 2016. Non-GAAP operating profit was RMB 2.6 billion, a 4.6% increase over the corresponding period in 2016. Income tax expenses was RMB 405 million for the first quarter. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 18.6% compared to 25.4% in Q1 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate reflected our operating loss narrowed for some loss-generating entities in the group. Net income attributable to Baidu for Q1 was RMB 1.8 billion, a 10.6% decrease from the corresponding period in 2016. Basic and diluted earnings per ADS for the first quarter amounted to RMB 4.65 and RMB 4.63, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu for Q1 was RMB 2.4 billion, a 1.3% increase year-on-year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS for Q1 was RMB 6.85. As of Q1, the company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of RMB 90.7 billion. Net operating cash flow (sic) [inflow] (28:38) and capital expenditures for the first quarter were RMB 4.7 billion and RMB 1.2 billion, respectively. Total head count on a consolidated basis including invested entities was about 43,400, as of the end of first quarter of 2017. This represents a decrease of 5.5% as compared to the end of last year (sic) [quarter] (29:04). Now let me provide you with our top-line guidance for the second quarter of 2017. We currently expect total revenue for the second quarter to be between RMB 20.47 billion and RMB 20.98 billion, representing an annual increase of 12.1% to 14.9% and the sequential increase of 21.2% to 24.2%. Please note, this forecast reflects Baidu's current and preliminary view, and is subject to change. I will now open the call to questions. Operator, please go ahead. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. The question-and-answer session of this conference call will start in a moment. Your first question comes from the line of Eddie Leung from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Eddie Leung - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, good morning. First of all, my best wishes to Jennifer for your next role. And then for my questions, I'm wondering if you could share more color with us on the different components of your revenue guidance for the second quarter, especially any color on the contribution of our subscription and the newer business, mobile news feed will be helpful? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi, Eddie. Thank you for your kind words. With regards to Q2 revenue, as you look at our business, essentially it's the core business as well as iQiyi that are the main revenue contributors. Within the core business, there is search, we're also putting a lot of efforts in the feed. The feed product, as Qi mentioned earlier, from a user adoption perspective, it's progressing very well. We're in the early stage of monetizing the product. So we had not been very much focused on or driving aggressively on the monetization front. So for our core business, it continues to be very search centric, and we are very excited to expand the service we can offer to our users and advertisers, and we expect a solid progress in that regard, and we should expect the search business to extend over the next few quarters. For the iQiyi business, as you would have seen from our 20-F, last year iQiyi had a very solid growth and the contribution to our overall business. iQiyi is integral part of the overall Baidu ecosystem, and they continue to deliver very strong top-line growth driven by the business model of the subscription user base. So if you look at Q2, sequentially, you continue – Q1, sequentially you continue to observe other revenue line continues to grow quarter-on-quarter, and a big part of that is iQiyi's a subscription user business. So iQiyi's revenue growth is on solid ground, the two engine advertising as well as subscription fees continue to grow very well. So we're still on the path of recovery from last year's incident, and search is ramping up very nicely. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chi Tsang from HSBC. Please go ahead. Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. Good morning, everybody, and again congratulations, Jennifer, on this next opportunity. I wanted to ask you about core search. In particular, I was wondering if you can touch on traffic as well as demand. On the traffic front, what are you guys seeing in terms of growth in traffic and maybe growth in paid clicks year-to-date? And I'm wondering, if you expect paid clicks to grow faster this year than last year? And then, in terms of demand, given the rebasing of your customer base, as well as with higher standards, what type of customer growth do you expect this year? Thanks so much. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. I'm going to take the first cut on Chi's question, and Qi and Robin can feel free to add. The traffic as overall continues to be very solid, mobile continues to be growing nicely, and a bigger proportion of the overall traffic. As you know, I mentioned earlier, the feed product is also we're busy developing that and seeing good progress on that. So from our product service perspective, we have the nicer search traffic as well as user engagement, that user has more time and interesting topics that they can view on the Baidu platform. For us to build in more of these inventories, it create more of the user products, it provides a bigger advertising pool and inventory for our advertisers. So I think going into 2017, later in the quarter, we should continue to expect that the paid clicks will power the growth of monetization. From a – the other question? Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. Customers, yeah. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Customer, customer wise also, I think seasonally Q1 was a low quarter, and I think for the remainder of the year, as we have richer product for our advertisers and our sales force, refocus their efforts to develop the market, we should expect the customer base to grow as well. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. Let me just add to what Jennifer described. With regard to search traffic, as we mentioned earlier, we view search as a fundamental human need, user need, and as we digitize more and more information, digitize more and more daily activities, the search overall demand will increase, that's number one. Number two, in current forms user express their intent through keywords, query input, landing on a set of information that will see its natural pace of growth as you have seen – our industry in China has been expanding so far. However, what I'll emphasize there is through AI technology innovations, we believe we can over time expand our search traffic by additional user experiences, for example you can search based on voice, you can search based on image, and more and more content will be available for search. So our focus is tapping into the current trend of user traffic growth for sure. At the same time, focusing on building better experience, more search capabilities, expanding into more search scenarios over time to expand search traffic. On the click, paid click side, again the pattern will be similar. The focus would be using AI technologies to understand the user intent better, and enable that to expose to advertisers, to our business customers, so that advertisers will have over time richer opportunities to place their campaigns as part of product, so that we have more opportunities to tap into the ongoing growing demand of advertising needs. So netted out, there's existing forms that's growing at its current pace and we're also focusing on tapping into future user traffic and future paid click growth opportunities through AI, through technological based enablement. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Alicia Yap - Citigroup Hi. Thank you. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer and Dr. Lu. Thanks for taking my questions. My questions is related to margins, so your comments of the operating margin including Baidu Core versus the Transaction Service, where Transaction Service 16.8% point reduction, does that mean in Q1, the margin on the Transaction Service only include the Baidu Takeout Delivery and the Map, but the Nuomi expenses is now part of the Baidu Core. And then how should we be thinking about the overall core margins in the future with news feed becoming a more meaningful part of the contributions? And then related to that, I wanted to ask about the content costs on the iQiyi front, is all the RMB 2.6 billion in Q1 is all related to iQiyi? Is there anything on that is related to the news feed content? And then with iQiyi recent licensing deal with Netflix, does the content cost guidance of doubling year-over-year this year still hold true, or should we expect even more than double in the content costs? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Alicia. So a few questions. First of all, the margin drag that we reported on Transaction Services was reported on the same concept and definition, consistent with the prior quarters. This is to give you an idea, and you can clearly see that we're reducing the investments on this front and we're shifting from mobile to AI. And so for your specific comment, Nuomi was included in this number and included in the Transaction Services, as a reminder, also has Financial Services, Baidu Delivery, Map and Nuomi, and so these are the main components. As I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to reduce spend on Nuomi and the other elements within the old transaction services sector has to do with core search or AI related initiatives. So, it doesn't really make sense for Transaction Service to stand as a separate sector, but for your information it's more to giving you an indication for this quarter that we are reducing spend on this front. For news feed, as mentioned before, news feed carries a different margin profile, and we're in the early stage of developing its business model from an advertising perspective. Currently, we're focusing on driving the user experience, user adoption, so investment related to feed has to do with the ecosystem buildup, content acquisition, R&D efforts, and some you can say infrastructure related, bandwidth and depreciation related to servers, because we're building the user traffic on the front. We haven't really focused on the advertising effort, but as Qi mentioned earlier, the business model is pretty apparent and the customers are quite open and acceptive to this advertising model. So, over time, we will ramp up the advertising and monetization capability. But at this point, it's very early stage. With regards to the content cost for Q1, yes, predominantly a biggest of majority of the Q1 content expense was iQiyi related. And as we mentioned earlier, our expectation is this year there will be a very important content investment mainly for iQiyi and also partly related to our feed product. The overall guidance we provided earlier that the content cost will likely go up the same percentage as before that estimate is still hold. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alan Hellawell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Alan Hellawell - Deutsche Bank AG (Hong Kong) Great. I just wanted to join the chorus in thanking Jennifer for setting a high watermark in the industry as a CFO, and also wish her the very best in her new role. A question around the interplay between demand for our search and news feed products. I can see key accounts scratching up new incremental budget to buy news feed ad, but I wonder if it is more cannibalistic to our budget limited SMEs that generally prefer the more focused sales generation aspects of buying a keyword to the more impression based aspect of news feed ad. And then just a quickie, a disclosure-related question. By folding in Transaction Services to Core search, are we no longer going to segregate out margin drag from Transaction Services and maybe even iQiyi? Thank you. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Let me first answer the first part of the question about on the demand side. The evidence so far has been showing a overall healthy growth and a specific evidence, I'll call out, is that, we have enabled our customers to place their campaign and budget in two ways. One is through their search campaign, they can indicate how much to go to the feeds, and there is also a separate interface that they can explicitly say, these budget will be on the feed side. There's a clear upward trend, a very rapid growth for customers, explicitly placing more campaign budget on the feed side, while maintaining their search campaign, search budget, and that's a clear signs of healthy growth, overall growth for our advertising needs for combined search and the feed products, number one. Number two, over time, we'll become more apparent that feed in many ways enable brand advertising to have a meaningful play at platforms. This is again very early. We're more focused on getting user experience to be truly, truly compelling and grow our user base and time spent. But from campaign demand perspective, our combined search and feed will enable more overall growth, not just from the traditional performance-based advertising into brand awareness based advertising as well. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And Alan, to your second question, yes, we're folding Transaction Services into Core, however, we will continue to separately identify iQiyi as a separate segment and report separately its margin impact on a quarterly basis. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alex Yao from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Alex Yao - JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on the Apollo project you guys announced recently. Does that make your autonomous car research project, open source type of the project, which will potentially impact your monetization capability. If it's not, can you help us understand your future project for monetizing the autonomous car driving initiative? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you for the question. That's a terrific question. As a matter of fact, I can tell you, my goal for project Apollo is to expand our monetization opportunities ahead, a real plausible path towards future economic value creation for Baidu. Specifically, let me give you the thumbnail of what Apollo is and comment on the business opportunities. First of all, as I described, it's open and compete in the reliable platforms. So we're open code, we're open software and then we're also open capabilities that through APIs. And we're also providing core services as the overall part of the platforms. The overarching design is any players in the auto industry with Apollo, you can put together the complete vehicle using off the shelf hardware components, and be able to run with different intelligent driving scenarios, and all the way up until 2020, towards fully autonomous driving. So that's the overarching vision by design. It's open innovation ecosystem. The key here is design point of that ecosystem, because the epic innovation center for the auto industry will be in data, in algorithms, in rapid pace of innovations towards intelligent driving. And Apollo is designed in that way, and I can tell you my personal experience, the Hadoop ecosystem, the core base come from my Yahoo! teams. And I personally witnessed through if you picked the right design point for the industry, you can tap into the vast growth and emphasize vast growth a win-win with all partners, and yet at the same times enable Baidu to tap into the economic opportunities. Now without going into the specifics, what I can point to you is, there is known ways of monetizing open networks, whether it's services, packaged softwares, components, solutions, all these options are available to Baidu to tap into. That's number one. Number two, the response from auto partners from industries has been, I could say, overwhelmingly positive, and our confidence of our ability to tap into the new rapid growth through the Apollo ecosystem and our ability to monetize is increased substantially, going forward. So it's a terrific question. Baidu not only want to enable a healthy ecosystem, but let's all make money in our way and grow the whole pie together. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Juan Lin from 86Research. Please go ahead. Juan Lin - 86Research Ltd. Hi. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer, Dr. Lu, and congratulations Jennifer on the new role. I have a question on the mobile gaming business. You mentioned that revenue contribution of mobile gaming business is around 3% of total revenue. I'm wondering what is the contribution to our profit. And after disconnecting this business, are you going to monetize the mobile game related traffic, which was previously directed to the mobile gaming business? Do you think that disconnecting business will eventually lead to a more efficient usage of your traffic in terms of monetization? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi. Mobile game, yes, as I said earlier, it contributed close to 3% of revenue last year. The game business operate, as you can see, is relatively small in our overall picture, and it doesn't generate the kind of margin as we do from our main business. So this transaction is actually a very good transaction for both us and the parties involved, and also it brings some good level of gains for us. For us, mobile game sector is always a very attractive sector for advertising business. And we do expect that even in the past, with mobile game operations, we have game advertising income and going forward, we will continue to develop this market and grow the mobile game advertiser base. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Natalie Wu from CICC. Please go ahead. Natalie Wu - CICC Hi. Good morning, management. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, I want to extend my best regards to Jennifer on her new role. And my question is regarding the margin of the Core business excluding Transaction Service and iQiyi, which seems to be declined quite a lot in the first quarter despite savings from traffic acquisition costs. So just wondering is it mainly due to the AI-related investment, or is there any other factors behind that? And how should we look at the trend going forward? And also just a little bit clarification on the mobile game, so that the consolidation of mobile game business will be since mid-May, right, so that is to say your current guidance is reflecting half quarter's consolidation of the game-related revenue? Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you for the question. Yes, for Q1, I think a couple of factors to think about as you look at the margins for Core. Mainly for Core, a couple of things are going about. One is, we're still recovering from, for our search service from the last year's incident. It has not been fully recovered. We're on the good path, it's ramping up, it's performing as expected. The other thing is the investment related to feed. As I mentioned earlier, early stage in terms of monetization, but we are very focused on building feed as a very solid and good complementary product to our search service. Related to that, our bandwidth, depreciation, R&D, content cost and also channel distribution investment to help mobile Baidu be more prominent among the user base. So that's the other factor going in Q1. And the third element, as you mentioned, AI investment, you have seen R&D expense increased year-on-year. As I mentioned earlier, the incremental spend would all be related to AI initiatives. AI initiatives are an integral part of our core service. It build upon the core technology capabilities and infrastructure capabilities. So that's what's driving the Q1's margin performance. For your second question with regards to mobile games, yes, you are correct. So basically, as I mentioned earlier, mobile game contributed to Q1 overall financial performance, it will only have about half of that in the Q2 period. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. So, Jennifer, what I would just add to emphasize the AI investment part, the placeholder (53:03) I would like to emphasize is, we will be very disciplined and systematically optimize our resource allocations to make sure that our engineering investments and R&D investment is truly tap into the substantial growth opportunities ahead of us. And we're going through lot of work across different teams to make sure that our resource allocation utilization is fully optimized towards two fundamental focus. One is elevating our current core business, we see a lot of growth opportunities ahead, and at the same time accelerating the commercialization of AI-enabled business. So, being disciplined and being very systemically in optimization is very important to us. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Piyush Mubayi from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Piyush Mubayi - Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC Thank you for taking my question. First, Jennifer, congratulations on your new role. We wish you the best in your future endeavors. My question is directed to Qi at this point. We recognized that Baidu is strongly positioned in AI R&D. As the business model evolves in the medium-term, could you give us a glimpse into the range of operating metrics that become relevant, so we can better understand and appreciate the new world we're getting into? And very specifically as we go into a face, voice, and image recognition based world that AI would bring about versus the current search monetization model in place, how do you think that's going to change? Thank you. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Well, thank you. Thank you for the questions. So, let me first comment on your first question with regard to operating metrics. First, myself, my teams are very, very focused on accelerating the commercialization of our AI-enabled new businesses, and because the core of AI technology is about efficiently extract knowledge from data, and our focus is first of all establish very, very compelling user scenarios, and users and usage are important part of metrics. And the second is the data and iteration (sic) [integration] (55:26) rate, how we can iterate (sic) [integrate] (55:28) based on the data that we have in our systems. And the third is rapidly explore business models and monetization capabilities. And adding up together, we are developing our overall operating frameworks and operating dashboards, these are the type of things, Jennifer, myself, our teams collectively look at every week, every months, and we're focusing on driving a disciplined and accelerated pace of execution on commercializing the AI initiative, AI-enabled new business initiatives. As I mentioned in my prepared speech earlier, as we move forward when appropriate, we will shed more light with the investor communities about those operating metrics, because it would take time to evolve, but what I can show you is our teams are staying very, very focused to be very disciplined and rigorous in accelerating our pace forward. With regard to your question about modality change, on the consumer side, our current view is that will not fundamentally affect the economic patterns, because even if you use voice instead of using keyboards, you still express your intent, and once we understand user intent, and we understand the content that users try to seek to access, we will be able to place match that in a good way, and existing models of advertising or other forms will be equally applicable in that scenario. So, at this stage, we do not see a fundamental shift even though modality may change, the economic opportunity in front of us will be equally compelling as we have seen up to this point. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Karen Chan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Karen Chan - Jefferies Hong Kong Ltd. Thank you management for taking my question. Congratulations to Jennifer on your new role. My first question is related to Core margins. So it is negatively impacted partly by the initial ramp up of mobile news feed ad. So how should we think about normalized margin level once the mobile news feed app reach a certain scalability? And my second question is regarding our monetization timeline of DuerOS apps with the AI-enabled home device partnership we secured. Wondering if management can share any color on that? Thanks. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thanks, Karen. I'll take the first part and Qi can help address the second. As I mentioned earlier, currently the margin doesn't reflect a true picture. I think we mentioned earlier, feed is a product that's going to carry a different margin profile. But overall, I think just purely focusing on margins is just one angle. It's more important to think about the overall service and revenue opportunities that we can generate because of the product of search. The core search continues to be a very fundamental need, and that business model is beautiful and scalable and high margin. First for feed to complement the search service, we give our advertisers a much bigger advertising inventory, and the advertisers, big or small, can have more budget allocated with us. So for us to think about feed because it is a push kind of product, it's different from search. The overall it's a mix, it's a more beautiful and more integrated, and richer service that we provide, and I think it's important to look at the bigger market value we can potentially tap. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. Let me comment on the second part of question with regard to DuerOS monetization and its timeline. And here is how we think about DuerOS, its position in the industry, and now we shed light on how we think about monetization. First of all, DuerOS is the AI generation user experience platform, very similar to iOS and Android. iOS, Android is really for fingers, the device sitting in everybody's pocket. DuerOS, the fundamental interaction is natural language and voice based and it's everywhere. It's on every device, in every scenario. So it's a platform in that regard. The second, DuerOS is also a new entry point, because as you use DuerOS more and more in your home, in your car, say, play the next song for me, order pizza that becomes a new entry. So it plays dual role as a experienced platform, a new form of entry. On the entry side, the monetization is very natural. This is very similar to today's information gateway, like search. And the timeline will be the amount of scale that we can grow into, and there will be natural opportunities we can tap into. The second is about the platforms. Traditionally, there are several dimension with platform economics. If you look at iOS and Android, there is ways to run a app store type models, you can get economical value. There is VIG for the applications that builds on top of the platforms, and at the same time DuerOS also strategically bring additional demand to our ABC cloud. So we can also indirectly monetize through that vehicles. So having said all of that, our focus right now is really grow the ecosystem. We're doing a good job. Our team is really racing ahead, every day, every week, we're signing up new partners. So our focus is on scale. But as I said, we see ourselves as a clear leader in China and the opportunities over time will be tremendous. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Grace Chen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Grace Chen - Morgan Stanley Taiwan Ltd. Hello. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. The question is about the search business. From the Q2 sales guidance, we can see that the search sales should be recovering on both QoQ and then year-over-year basis. Can you help us understand what are the key drivers for the sales recovery in terms of market segments? And also can you comment on the competitive landscape, in the advertising business in general, for example, from like social and e-commerce peers? And also on the margin for search business, as we've just discussed that, we can see that margin have been contracting in the past two quarters for a couple of reasons. So with the sales recovery and margins recover (sic) [recovery] (62:06), so can you give us a guidance about the reasonable margin level of the search business? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. I think for us, as you noted correctly, the business is recovering and rebuilding. The factors that we look at, many other factors have a lot of potential, specifically education, real estate, local services, like even retail continues to be very strong. I mentioned earlier also like the sectors like games, could be a lot of possibilities too. So as we look forward, search continues to have a lot of verticals that we can further develop and service our customers better, and with complementary feed products to service even bigger customer pools. I think for us to look at the overall business performance, it's our focus to run a highly efficient business. We have always steered our resources towards strategically important areas. As we identified AI as our key strategic focus, a lot of the effort is focusing on the R&D side, in particular, related to talent. So as I mentioned, if you look at the margin performance for the year, I have given a pretty clear indication in terms of how you look at our overall business. Basically this year, I think for us, we've talked about content that's related to iQiyi and our overall ecosystem build up. I talked about R&D that's related to talent, specifically for AI. And I think these are the main items and the rest of us is to focus on execution. No specific margin guidance, but I think I hope the information we provided is helpful for you to construct your margin picture. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. With regard to competitions, what I will emphasize is, first, we are clearly the market leaders, particularly in search market share on mobiles, and that's number one. Number two, our focus is on innovations, our focus on expanding the search scenarios, particularly expand search capability, so that search experience is fundamentally natural to a mobile device and tap into the rich capabilities such as camera and speech, so that over times we will be more compelling. And last, I will say is search at its core is a scaling business. There is a fundamental scaling impact. As market leaders, we want to fully leverage that, so that our technological capabilities with the new AI at the core will understand user better than any other, and understand content better than any others. So over time, we are confident that we will be able to maintain a strong market leadership position. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. So let me just add on the search revenue side. I think the search business has been a very traffic bound business. Advertisers or customers they all want to buy more traffic, and the performance is unmatched by any other type of media online or offline. So our focus has been and will continue to be on growing the search traffic, so we're not worried about other type of advertisement from other type of media. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ming Xu from UBS. Please go ahead. Ming Xu - UBS Securities (Asia) Ltd. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I have two questions. The first one is on the news feed side. So, if you name one key area to improve on the user experience of news feed, so I'm wondering whether it's – what is that, whether it's recommendation algorithm or targeting or content or something others. Could you help us understand. And secondly, my second question is on CPC. I think from 20-F, we know that last year, the number of paid clicks actually (66:45) more quickly than revenue growth indicating that the CPC is actually down. So you just mentioned that this year the paid clicks will continue to grow. So could you also comment on the CPC trend? Thanks. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Let me first talk about the feed side, good question. If there is one thing for us to focus is the quality of the matching algorithms, because the search product fundamentally is about deeply understand a user, the user's interest, the information needs, on the other hand understand the content, but that's core is about matching them together. So the areas for us to focus on or the top priority areas is the quality of the matching algorithm, so that we can sustainably improve the overall user satisfaction and grow the base of that product. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And on your second question, yes, last year – if you recall, last year, we took effort to have a higher standard for our customers. And as a result, a lot of the customers are removed or unable to do business with us. For search, it is a bidding business model, when you have less like a smaller advertiser pool, the bidding will not be as intense. So that in itself can affect the CPC. However, looking at the paid click trend, you will notice that for this kind of phenomenon to occur, our advertisers are actually having better ROIs for the business. It continues to speak to this high performance nature of paid search and it's just a matter of transition now we're going through that CPC was a result of that, but that's not something that I feel should be worrisome. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Evan Zhou from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Evan Zhou - Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Ltd. Hi, Jennifer. Thank you for taking my questions. Just lastly, I wanted to ask an update about Baidu Financial Services, wondering whether this is actually becoming more of a visible or higher contribution portion within the other revenue being recognized in the first quarter, and how is the kind of profitability improvement within this segment for our business, because we have also seen some across industry, the overall growth, and profitability has improved a lot in the past few months. So I wonder if I can get an update on that. Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. For our Financial Services business, it does generate financing income, and that would flow through other revenue. It's still in its early stage, and having us building the fundamental capability like leveraging data and algorithm to have better modeling for credit risk underwriting would be the focus. So if you would see that we position our Financial Services business as a Fintech business, and we do originations and wealth management to help train our models, and so that we can really get better handling of the much richer data that we have and the technology capability. So Financial Services itself as effort is progressing very well, and I think it's on the path of getting more stronger fundamental capability in helping using the technology and a different angle to look at the Financial Services business.

The question-and-answer session of this conference call will start in a moment. Your first question comes from the line of Eddie Leung from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Eddie Leung - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, good morning. First of all, my best wishes to Jennifer for your next role. And then for my questions, I'm wondering if you could share more color with us on the different components of your revenue guidance for the second quarter, especially any color on the contribution of our subscription and the newer business, mobile news feed will be helpful? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi, Eddie. Thank you for your kind words. With regards to Q2 revenue, as you look at our business, essentially it's the core business as well as iQiyi that are the main revenue contributors. Within the core business, there is search, we're also putting a lot of efforts in the feed. The feed product, as Qi mentioned earlier, from a user adoption perspective, it's progressing very well. We're in the early stage of monetizing the product. So we had not been very much focused on or driving aggressively on the monetization front. So for our core business, it continues to be very search centric, and we are very excited to expand the service we can offer to our users and advertisers, and we expect a solid progress in that regard, and we should expect the search business to extend over the next few quarters. For the iQiyi business, as you would have seen from our 20-F, last year iQiyi had a very solid growth and the contribution to our overall business. iQiyi is integral part of the overall Baidu ecosystem, and they continue to deliver very strong top-line growth driven by the business model of the subscription user base. So if you look at Q2, sequentially, you continue – Q1, sequentially you continue to observe other revenue line continues to grow quarter-on-quarter, and a big part of that is iQiyi's a subscription user business. So iQiyi's revenue growth is on solid ground, the two engine advertising as well as subscription fees continue to grow very well. So we're still on the path of recovery from last year's incident, and search is ramping up very nicely. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chi Tsang from HSBC. Please go ahead. Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. Good morning, everybody, and again congratulations, Jennifer, on this next opportunity. I wanted to ask you about core search. In particular, I was wondering if you can touch on traffic as well as demand. On the traffic front, what are you guys seeing in terms of growth in traffic and maybe growth in paid clicks year-to-date? And I'm wondering, if you expect paid clicks to grow faster this year than last year? And then, in terms of demand, given the rebasing of your customer base, as well as with higher standards, what type of customer growth do you expect this year? Thanks so much. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. I'm going to take the first cut on Chi's question, and Qi and Robin can feel free to add. The traffic as overall continues to be very solid, mobile continues to be growing nicely, and a bigger proportion of the overall traffic. As you know, I mentioned earlier, the feed product is also we're busy developing that and seeing good progress on that. So from our product service perspective, we have the nicer search traffic as well as user engagement, that user has more time and interesting topics that they can view on the Baidu platform. For us to build in more of these inventories, it create more of the user products, it provides a bigger advertising pool and inventory for our advertisers. So I think going into 2017, later in the quarter, we should continue to expect that the paid clicks will power the growth of monetization. From a – the other question? Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. Customers, yeah. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Customer, customer wise also, I think seasonally Q1 was a low quarter, and I think for the remainder of the year, as we have richer product for our advertisers and our sales force, refocus their efforts to develop the market, we should expect the customer base to grow as well. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. Let me just add to what Jennifer described. With regard to search traffic, as we mentioned earlier, we view search as a fundamental human need, user need, and as we digitize more and more information, digitize more and more daily activities, the search overall demand will increase, that's number one. Number two, in current forms user express their intent through keywords, query input, landing on a set of information that will see its natural pace of growth as you have seen – our industry in China has been expanding so far. However, what I'll emphasize there is through AI technology innovations, we believe we can over time expand our search traffic by additional user experiences, for example you can search based on voice, you can search based on image, and more and more content will be available for search. So our focus is tapping into the current trend of user traffic growth for sure. At the same time, focusing on building better experience, more search capabilities, expanding into more search scenarios over time to expand search traffic. On the click, paid click side, again the pattern will be similar. The focus would be using AI technologies to understand the user intent better, and enable that to expose to advertisers, to our business customers, so that advertisers will have over time richer opportunities to place their campaigns as part of product, so that we have more opportunities to tap into the ongoing growing demand of advertising needs. So netted out, there's existing forms that's growing at its current pace and we're also focusing on tapping into future user traffic and future paid click growth opportunities through AI, through technological based enablement. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Alicia Yap - Citigroup Hi. Thank you. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer and Dr. Lu. Thanks for taking my questions. My questions is related to margins, so your comments of the operating margin including Baidu Core versus the Transaction Service, where Transaction Service 16.8% point reduction, does that mean in Q1, the margin on the Transaction Service only include the Baidu Takeout Delivery and the Map, but the Nuomi expenses is now part of the Baidu Core. And then how should we be thinking about the overall core margins in the future with news feed becoming a more meaningful part of the contributions? And then related to that, I wanted to ask about the content costs on the iQiyi front, is all the RMB 2.6 billion in Q1 is all related to iQiyi? Is there anything on that is related to the news feed content? And then with iQiyi recent licensing deal with Netflix, does the content cost guidance of doubling year-over-year this year still hold true, or should we expect even more than double in the content costs? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Alicia. So a few questions. First of all, the margin drag that we reported on Transaction Services was reported on the same concept and definition, consistent with the prior quarters. This is to give you an idea, and you can clearly see that we're reducing the investments on this front and we're shifting from mobile to AI. And so for your specific comment, Nuomi was included in this number and included in the Transaction Services, as a reminder, also has Financial Services, Baidu Delivery, Map and Nuomi, and so these are the main components. As I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to reduce spend on Nuomi and the other elements within the old transaction services sector has to do with core search or AI related initiatives. So, it doesn't really make sense for Transaction Service to stand as a separate sector, but for your information it's more to giving you an indication for this quarter that we are reducing spend on this front. For news feed, as mentioned before, news feed carries a different margin profile, and we're in the early stage of developing its business model from an advertising perspective. Currently, we're focusing on driving the user experience, user adoption, so investment related to feed has to do with the ecosystem buildup, content acquisition, R&D efforts, and some you can say infrastructure related, bandwidth and depreciation related to servers, because we're building the user traffic on the front. We haven't really focused on the advertising effort, but as Qi mentioned earlier, the business model is pretty apparent and the customers are quite open and acceptive to this advertising model. So, over time, we will ramp up the advertising and monetization capability. But at this point, it's very early stage. With regards to the content cost for Q1, yes, predominantly a biggest of majority of the Q1 content expense was iQiyi related. And as we mentioned earlier, our expectation is this year there will be a very important content investment mainly for iQiyi and also partly related to our feed product. The overall guidance we provided earlier that the content cost will likely go up the same percentage as before that estimate is still hold. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alan Hellawell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Alan Hellawell - Deutsche Bank AG (Hong Kong) Great. I just wanted to join the chorus in thanking Jennifer for setting a high watermark in the industry as a CFO, and also wish her the very best in her new role. A question around the interplay between demand for our search and news feed products. I can see key accounts scratching up new incremental budget to buy news feed ad, but I wonder if it is more cannibalistic to our budget limited SMEs that generally prefer the more focused sales generation aspects of buying a keyword to the more impression based aspect of news feed ad. And then just a quickie, a disclosure-related question. By folding in Transaction Services to Core search, are we no longer going to segregate out margin drag from Transaction Services and maybe even iQiyi? Thank you. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Let me first answer the first part of the question about on the demand side. The evidence so far has been showing a overall healthy growth and a specific evidence, I'll call out, is that, we have enabled our customers to place their campaign and budget in two ways. One is through their search campaign, they can indicate how much to go to the feeds, and there is also a separate interface that they can explicitly say, these budget will be on the feed side. There's a clear upward trend, a very rapid growth for customers, explicitly placing more campaign budget on the feed side, while maintaining their search campaign, search budget, and that's a clear signs of healthy growth, overall growth for our advertising needs for combined search and the feed products, number one. Number two, over time, we'll become more apparent that feed in many ways enable brand advertising to have a meaningful play at platforms. This is again very early. We're more focused on getting user experience to be truly, truly compelling and grow our user base and time spent. But from campaign demand perspective, our combined search and feed will enable more overall growth, not just from the traditional performance-based advertising into brand awareness based advertising as well. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And Alan, to your second question, yes, we're folding Transaction Services into Core, however, we will continue to separately identify iQiyi as a separate segment and report separately its margin impact on a quarterly basis. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alex Yao from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Alex Yao - JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on the Apollo project you guys announced recently. Does that make your autonomous car research project, open source type of the project, which will potentially impact your monetization capability. If it's not, can you help us understand your future project for monetizing the autonomous car driving initiative? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you for the question. That's a terrific question. As a matter of fact, I can tell you, my goal for project Apollo is to expand our monetization opportunities ahead, a real plausible path towards future economic value creation for Baidu. Specifically, let me give you the thumbnail of what Apollo is and comment on the business opportunities. First of all, as I described, it's open and compete in the reliable platforms. So we're open code, we're open software and then we're also open capabilities that through APIs. And we're also providing core services as the overall part of the platforms. The overarching design is any players in the auto industry with Apollo, you can put together the complete vehicle using off the shelf hardware components, and be able to run with different intelligent driving scenarios, and all the way up until 2020, towards fully autonomous driving. So that's the overarching vision by design. It's open innovation ecosystem. The key here is design point of that ecosystem, because the epic innovation center for the auto industry will be in data, in algorithms, in rapid pace of innovations towards intelligent driving. And Apollo is designed in that way, and I can tell you my personal experience, the Hadoop ecosystem, the core base come from my Yahoo! teams. And I personally witnessed through if you picked the right design point for the industry, you can tap into the vast growth and emphasize vast growth a win-win with all partners, and yet at the same times enable Baidu to tap into the economic opportunities. Now without going into the specifics, what I can point to you is, there is known ways of monetizing open networks, whether it's services, packaged softwares, components, solutions, all these options are available to Baidu to tap into. That's number one. Number two, the response from auto partners from industries has been, I could say, overwhelmingly positive, and our confidence of our ability to tap into the new rapid growth through the Apollo ecosystem and our ability to monetize is increased substantially, going forward. So it's a terrific question. Baidu not only want to enable a healthy ecosystem, but let's all make money in our way and grow the whole pie together. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Juan Lin from 86Research. Please go ahead. Juan Lin - 86Research Ltd. Hi. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer, Dr. Lu, and congratulations Jennifer on the new role. I have a question on the mobile gaming business. You mentioned that revenue contribution of mobile gaming business is around 3% of total revenue. I'm wondering what is the contribution to our profit. And after disconnecting this business, are you going to monetize the mobile game related traffic, which was previously directed to the mobile gaming business? Do you think that disconnecting business will eventually lead to a more efficient usage of your traffic in terms of monetization? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi. Mobile game, yes, as I said earlier, it contributed close to 3% of revenue last year. The game business operate, as you can see, is relatively small in our overall picture, and it doesn't generate the kind of margin as we do from our main business. So this transaction is actually a very good transaction for both us and the parties involved, and also it brings some good level of gains for us. For us, mobile game sector is always a very attractive sector for advertising business. And we do expect that even in the past, with mobile game operations, we have game advertising income and going forward, we will continue to develop this market and grow the mobile game advertiser base. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Natalie Wu from CICC. Please go ahead. Natalie Wu - CICC Hi. Good morning, management. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, I want to extend my best regards to Jennifer on her new role. And my question is regarding the margin of the Core business excluding Transaction Service and iQiyi, which seems to be declined quite a lot in the first quarter despite savings from traffic acquisition costs. So just wondering is it mainly due to the AI-related investment, or is there any other factors behind that? And how should we look at the trend going forward? And also just a little bit clarification on the mobile game, so that the consolidation of mobile game business will be since mid-May, right, so that is to say your current guidance is reflecting half quarter's consolidation of the game-related revenue? Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you for the question. Yes, for Q1, I think a couple of factors to think about as you look at the margins for Core. Mainly for Core, a couple of things are going about. One is, we're still recovering from, for our search service from the last year's incident. It has not been fully recovered. We're on the good path, it's ramping up, it's performing as expected. The other thing is the investment related to feed. As I mentioned earlier, early stage in terms of monetization, but we are very focused on building feed as a very solid and good complementary product to our search service. Related to that, our bandwidth, depreciation, R&D, content cost and also channel distribution investment to help mobile Baidu be more prominent among the user base. So that's the other factor going in Q1. And the third element, as you mentioned, AI investment, you have seen R&D expense increased year-on-year. As I mentioned earlier, the incremental spend would all be related to AI initiatives. AI initiatives are an integral part of our core service. It build upon the core technology capabilities and infrastructure capabilities. So that's what's driving the Q1's margin performance. For your second question with regards to mobile games, yes, you are correct. So basically, as I mentioned earlier, mobile game contributed to Q1 overall financial performance, it will only have about half of that in the Q2 period. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. So, Jennifer, what I would just add to emphasize the AI investment part, the placeholder (53:03) I would like to emphasize is, we will be very disciplined and systematically optimize our resource allocations to make sure that our engineering investments and R&D investment is truly tap into the substantial growth opportunities ahead of us. And we're going through lot of work across different teams to make sure that our resource allocation utilization is fully optimized towards two fundamental focus. One is elevating our current core business, we see a lot of growth opportunities ahead, and at the same time accelerating the commercialization of AI-enabled business. So, being disciplined and being very systemically in optimization is very important to us. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Piyush Mubayi from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Piyush Mubayi - Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC Thank you for taking my question. First, Jennifer, congratulations on your new role. We wish you the best in your future endeavors. My question is directed to Qi at this point. We recognized that Baidu is strongly positioned in AI R&D. As the business model evolves in the medium-term, could you give us a glimpse into the range of operating metrics that become relevant, so we can better understand and appreciate the new world we're getting into? And very specifically as we go into a face, voice, and image recognition based world that AI would bring about versus the current search monetization model in place, how do you think that's going to change? Thank you. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Well, thank you. Thank you for the questions. So, let me first comment on your first question with regard to operating metrics. First, myself, my teams are very, very focused on accelerating the commercialization of our AI-enabled new businesses, and because the core of AI technology is about efficiently extract knowledge from data, and our focus is first of all establish very, very compelling user scenarios, and users and usage are important part of metrics. And the second is the data and iteration (sic) [integration] (55:26) rate, how we can iterate (sic) [integrate] (55:28) based on the data that we have in our systems. And the third is rapidly explore business models and monetization capabilities. And adding up together, we are developing our overall operating frameworks and operating dashboards, these are the type of things, Jennifer, myself, our teams collectively look at every week, every months, and we're focusing on driving a disciplined and accelerated pace of execution on commercializing the AI initiative, AI-enabled new business initiatives. As I mentioned in my prepared speech earlier, as we move forward when appropriate, we will shed more light with the investor communities about those operating metrics, because it would take time to evolve, but what I can show you is our teams are staying very, very focused to be very disciplined and rigorous in accelerating our pace forward. With regard to your question about modality change, on the consumer side, our current view is that will not fundamentally affect the economic patterns, because even if you use voice instead of using keyboards, you still express your intent, and once we understand user intent, and we understand the content that users try to seek to access, we will be able to place match that in a good way, and existing models of advertising or other forms will be equally applicable in that scenario. So, at this stage, we do not see a fundamental shift even though modality may change, the economic opportunity in front of us will be equally compelling as we have seen up to this point. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Karen Chan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Karen Chan - Jefferies Hong Kong Ltd. Thank you management for taking my question. Congratulations to Jennifer on your new role. My first question is related to Core margins. So it is negatively impacted partly by the initial ramp up of mobile news feed ad. So how should we think about normalized margin level once the mobile news feed app reach a certain scalability? And my second question is regarding our monetization timeline of DuerOS apps with the AI-enabled home device partnership we secured. Wondering if management can share any color on that? Thanks. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thanks, Karen. I'll take the first part and Qi can help address the second. As I mentioned earlier, currently the margin doesn't reflect a true picture. I think we mentioned earlier, feed is a product that's going to carry a different margin profile. But overall, I think just purely focusing on margins is just one angle. It's more important to think about the overall service and revenue opportunities that we can generate because of the product of search. The core search continues to be a very fundamental need, and that business model is beautiful and scalable and high margin. First for feed to complement the search service, we give our advertisers a much bigger advertising inventory, and the advertisers, big or small, can have more budget allocated with us. So for us to think about feed because it is a push kind of product, it's different from search. The overall it's a mix, it's a more beautiful and more integrated, and richer service that we provide, and I think it's important to look at the bigger market value we can potentially tap. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. Let me comment on the second part of question with regard to DuerOS monetization and its timeline. And here is how we think about DuerOS, its position in the industry, and now we shed light on how we think about monetization. First of all, DuerOS is the AI generation user experience platform, very similar to iOS and Android. iOS, Android is really for fingers, the device sitting in everybody's pocket. DuerOS, the fundamental interaction is natural language and voice based and it's everywhere. It's on every device, in every scenario. So it's a platform in that regard. The second, DuerOS is also a new entry point, because as you use DuerOS more and more in your home, in your car, say, play the next song for me, order pizza that becomes a new entry. So it plays dual role as a experienced platform, a new form of entry. On the entry side, the monetization is very natural. This is very similar to today's information gateway, like search. And the timeline will be the amount of scale that we can grow into, and there will be natural opportunities we can tap into. The second is about the platforms. Traditionally, there are several dimension with platform economics. If you look at iOS and Android, there is ways to run a app store type models, you can get economical value. There is VIG for the applications that builds on top of the platforms, and at the same time DuerOS also strategically bring additional demand to our ABC cloud. So we can also indirectly monetize through that vehicles. So having said all of that, our focus right now is really grow the ecosystem. We're doing a good job. Our team is really racing ahead, every day, every week, we're signing up new partners. So our focus is on scale. But as I said, we see ourselves as a clear leader in China and the opportunities over time will be tremendous. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Grace Chen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Grace Chen - Morgan Stanley Taiwan Ltd. Hello. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. The question is about the search business. From the Q2 sales guidance, we can see that the search sales should be recovering on both QoQ and then year-over-year basis. Can you help us understand what are the key drivers for the sales recovery in terms of market segments? And also can you comment on the competitive landscape, in the advertising business in general, for example, from like social and e-commerce peers? And also on the margin for search business, as we've just discussed that, we can see that margin have been contracting in the past two quarters for a couple of reasons. So with the sales recovery and margins recover (sic) [recovery] (62:06), so can you give us a guidance about the reasonable margin level of the search business? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. I think for us, as you noted correctly, the business is recovering and rebuilding. The factors that we look at, many other factors have a lot of potential, specifically education, real estate, local services, like even retail continues to be very strong. I mentioned earlier also like the sectors like games, could be a lot of possibilities too. So as we look forward, search continues to have a lot of verticals that we can further develop and service our customers better, and with complementary feed products to service even bigger customer pools. I think for us to look at the overall business performance, it's our focus to run a highly efficient business. We have always steered our resources towards strategically important areas. As we identified AI as our key strategic focus, a lot of the effort is focusing on the R&D side, in particular, related to talent. So as I mentioned, if you look at the margin performance for the year, I have given a pretty clear indication in terms of how you look at our overall business. Basically this year, I think for us, we've talked about content that's related to iQiyi and our overall ecosystem build up. I talked about R&D that's related to talent, specifically for AI. And I think these are the main items and the rest of us is to focus on execution. No specific margin guidance, but I think I hope the information we provided is helpful for you to construct your margin picture. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. With regard to competitions, what I will emphasize is, first, we are clearly the market leaders, particularly in search market share on mobiles, and that's number one. Number two, our focus is on innovations, our focus on expanding the search scenarios, particularly expand search capability, so that search experience is fundamentally natural to a mobile device and tap into the rich capabilities such as camera and speech, so that over times we will be more compelling. And last, I will say is search at its core is a scaling business. There is a fundamental scaling impact. As market leaders, we want to fully leverage that, so that our technological capabilities with the new AI at the core will understand user better than any other, and understand content better than any others. So over time, we are confident that we will be able to maintain a strong market leadership position. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. So let me just add on the search revenue side. I think the search business has been a very traffic bound business. Advertisers or customers they all want to buy more traffic, and the performance is unmatched by any other type of media online or offline. So our focus has been and will continue to be on growing the search traffic, so we're not worried about other type of advertisement from other type of media. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ming Xu from UBS. Please go ahead. Ming Xu - UBS Securities (Asia) Ltd. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I have two questions. The first one is on the news feed side. So, if you name one key area to improve on the user experience of news feed, so I'm wondering whether it's – what is that, whether it's recommendation algorithm or targeting or content or something others. Could you help us understand. And secondly, my second question is on CPC. I think from 20-F, we know that last year, the number of paid clicks actually (66:45) more quickly than revenue growth indicating that the CPC is actually down. So you just mentioned that this year the paid clicks will continue to grow. So could you also comment on the CPC trend? Thanks. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Let me first talk about the feed side, good question. If there is one thing for us to focus is the quality of the matching algorithms, because the search product fundamentally is about deeply understand a user, the user's interest, the information needs, on the other hand understand the content, but that's core is about matching them together. So the areas for us to focus on or the top priority areas is the quality of the matching algorithm, so that we can sustainably improve the overall user satisfaction and grow the base of that product. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And on your second question, yes, last year – if you recall, last year, we took effort to have a higher standard for our customers. And as a result, a lot of the customers are removed or unable to do business with us. For search, it is a bidding business model, when you have less like a smaller advertiser pool, the bidding will not be as intense. So that in itself can affect the CPC. However, looking at the paid click trend, you will notice that for this kind of phenomenon to occur, our advertisers are actually having better ROIs for the business. It continues to speak to this high performance nature of paid search and it's just a matter of transition now we're going through that CPC was a result of that, but that's not something that I feel should be worrisome. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Evan Zhou from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Evan Zhou - Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Ltd. Hi, Jennifer. Thank you for taking my questions. Just lastly, I wanted to ask an update about Baidu Financial Services, wondering whether this is actually becoming more of a visible or higher contribution portion within the other revenue being recognized in the first quarter, and how is the kind of profitability improvement within this segment for our business, because we have also seen some across industry, the overall growth, and profitability has improved a lot in the past few months. So I wonder if I can get an update on that. Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. For our Financial Services business, it does generate financing income, and that would flow through other revenue. It's still in its early stage, and having us building the fundamental capability like leveraging data and algorithm to have better modeling for credit risk underwriting would be the focus. So if you would see that we position our Financial Services business as a Fintech business, and we do originations and wealth management to help train our models, and so that we can really get better handling of the much richer data that we have and the technology capability. So Financial Services itself as effort is progressing very well, and I think it's on the path of getting more stronger fundamental capability in helping using the technology and a different angle to look at the Financial Services business.

Today's conference is being recorded.  At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Hann.  Please go ahead sir. Dan Hann Thank you, Stacy.  Good morning and welcome to Biomet’s first quarter conference call.  Joining me this morning is Greg Hartman, our CFO; Chuck Niemier, President of Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine; Garry England, COO for Domestic Operations; and Greg Sasso, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Communications. To address any forward-looking statements made during the course of this conference call, we refer you to the paragraph regarding forward-looking statements included in Biomet's first quarter press release issued earlier this morning. We will begin with sales.  During the first quarter of fiscal ’07, net sales increased 5% to $508.2 million. International sales increased 9% while sales in the US increased 3%.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which increased first quarter sales by approximately $3 million, net sales increased 4% worldwide.  We are pleased that Biomet continues to gain market share in the domestic and worldwide reconstructive device market, principally is a result of a significant number of new product introductions and technologies that have recently been launched to our customers.  However, the company’s fixation spinal sales were $12 million below management’s expectations during the first quarter of fiscal ’07.   The company has implemented numerous changes in its Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine operations formerly known as EBI.  First, we appointed Biomet’s former COO of International Operations, Chuck Niemier, with a proven operational track record as President of Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine.  Other key senior management changes at Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine include the appointment of a new Vice President of Finance, with significant financial management experience, most recently with Aircast; and a new Vice President of Sales with over 20 years of sales management experience with J&J Orthopedics and Biomet Orthopedics. While the revenue numbers at Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine were disappointing during the first quarter, I can assure you that significant progress is being made.  We have implemented a new computer system, replacing the outdated system at the former EBI operation.  Additionally, sales support systems which allow the sales representative to place orders directly into the system have recently been installed and will continue being installed over the next quarter.  Furthermore, we have begun in-sourcing the manufacture Biomet Spine’s hardware system and within the next nine months we plan to be manufacturing all the company’s spinal hardware systems in-house. Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine is currently adding research development and engineering team members in order to accelerate the introduction of new products to its customers.  Indeed, Biomet Trauma will launch approximately 12 new products during fiscal ’07, while Biomet Spine will introduce approximately 15 new products during this fiscal year, including ten products that will be shown in North American Spine Society (NASS) meeting next week in Seattle.   We’ve critically examined the former EBI staffing needs and we have eliminated 330 physicians, or approximately 15% of EBI’s workforce, since May 31, 2005.  These reductions should allow Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine to show positive earnings growth throughout the remainder of fiscal ‘07. Reconstructive device sales increased 9% worldwide to $351.7 million during the first quarter and increased 8% in the U.S.  Knee sales increased 11% worldwide and in the United States during the first quarter, against last year’s first quarter growth rate of 17% worldwide and 16% in the U.S.  Excluding instruments, knee sales increased 11% worldwide and 12% in the US.  With last quarter’s knee market growth estimated to be 6.5% worldwide and 8% in the US, we continue to be pleased with the market share gains we were achieving in knees.   First quarter knee sales growth was driven by continued strong demand worldwide for the Vanguard Complete Knee System and the Oxford Unicompartmental Knee System.  The Vanguard Complete Knee System, the most comprehensive total knee system on the market today, provides full interchangeability of the system’s femoral and tibial components to address virtually any anatomical difference regardless of the patient’s race, gender, stature or any other variables. The Vanguard is engineered to provide precise fit for all patients while providing greater bone preservation and competitive high flex systems.  The Vanguard System can be implanted using Biomet's microplasty minimally invasive knee instruments or the Vanguard premier instrumentation.   Biomet continues to lead the market in minimally invasive total knee instrumentation as a result of its pioneering work and its technology.  Approximately 1,300 sets of Biomet’s microplasty knee instruments have been released in the U.S. during the past three fiscal years. The Vanguard premiere instrumentation rollout continued during the first quarter with approximately 270 sets now in the field.  The premier instrumentation is designed for implantation of the Vanguard System utilizing a conventional open procedure.   The Oxford Unicompartmental Knee System, the only true mobile uni-knee approved for sale in the U.S. has experienced excellent long-term clinical success outside the United States.  Results include a 98% success rate at ten years follow up, 95% success at 15 years, with 93% success reported at 20 years. During the first quarter of fiscal ’07, 160 domestic surgeons completed Oxford-specific training with approximately 1,500 surgeons trained during the past two years.  During the second quarter, training for the Oxford system is planned for an addition 125 surgeons.   Biomet’s new revision knee system, the Vanguard SSK Super Stabilized Knee, continued to receive excellent market acceptance during the first quarter, as well as the Vanguard PFR patellofemoral replacement, a conservative treatment option for patients with cartilage degeneration isolated in the front mid section of the knee.   On October 25th,  the California hospital medical center in Los Angeles will broadcast the first live webcast of the implementation of the Vanguard SSK Revision System which will be performed by Dr. Edward McPherson of the Los Angeles Orthopedic Institute. The Vanguard SSK features various modular options that provide surgeons with the ability to customize the implant to accommodate the specific needs of an individual patient.  Additionally, the modularity of the Vanguard SSK gives surgeons the ability to address complex bone defects often present in revision cases.   During the first quarter, we also continued to roll out Vanguard anterior stabilized implants and instruments.  Additionally, the enrollment with the IDE study relating to the rotating platform version of the Vanguard was initiated during the quarter. Next we’ll look at hip sales.  During the first quarter, hip sales increased 8% worldwide and 3% in United States against last year’s first quarter growth rate of 12% worldwide and 7% in the United States.  Excluding instruments, hip sales increased 9% worldwide and 4% in the U.S.  Biomet’s alternative-bearing products continued to repeat strong worldwide market acceptance during the first quarter while the M2a-Magnum continued to further penetrate the metal-on-metal acetabular market.   Metal-on-metal acetabular system sales experienced 11.5% growth in Europe during the first quarter with 9% growth in the United States.  Biomet C2a-Taper Acetabular System featuring ceramic-on-ceramic articulation and our proven porous plasma spray coating technology, continued to experience strong market acceptance in the U.S. with the introduction in fiscal year 2006. The bone-conserving ReCap Total Resurfacing System, which is indicated for  patients in the early stages of degenerative joint disease continues to experience strong market acceptance in Europe. In the U.S., 8 sites have been approved to participate in the IDE study for the Recap Total Resurfacing System and we continue to enroll patients with additional sites pending approval.   Biomet’s Taperloc porous coated hip stems continued to repeat excellent market demand worldwide during the first quarter.  In Europe, the Aura, Aura II and the Biometric stems also experienced strong demand during the first quarter.  Also, in Europe the bone master hip implant was introduced to the market, which is the first hip device to be offered with hydroxyapatite coating. Clinical trials are ongoing in the US for a new generation of bone-sparing primary hip stems.  The new balance and Taperloc Microplasty hip system will offer the industry’s first and most advanced design features for modern hip stem while maintaining the clinically proven Biomet’s design philosophy.  The design rational for these reduced length component wills be suited to those surgeons offering minimally invasive hip procedures along with surgeons whose design preference is proximally coated primary hip.  Surgeon feedback continues to be positive with more than 225 Microplasty stems implanted during the past five quarters. Biomet initiated the launch of the Microplasty ASI, Anterior Supine Intramuscular Hip Program and began conducting cadaver lab training sessions for surgeons in the U.S. and Europe during the past quarter.  To-date, approximately 100 ASI instrument sets have been rolled out and more than 80 surgeons have received ASI training with additional ASI labs scheduled throughout fiscal 2007. ArComXL, Biomet’s highly crosslinked polyethylene, continued to receive excellent market acceptance during the first quarter.  ArCom provides a 47% to 64% decrease in volumetric wear rates over standard ArCom in laboratory studies and offers a 30% increase in ultimate tensile strength along with similar wear-particle shape and size  with no measurable oxidation exhibited for cell rated agents. Clinical evaluations are underway for Biomet’s Regenerex Titanium Construct, and we are scheduled to initiate the launch a Regenerex cup and augment midway through this fiscal year.  As a result of Biomet’s pioneering efforts, Titanium has become a clinically proven material in the orthopedic market, resulting in optimal biological fixation.  We believe the long-term clinical success of Biomet’s Titanium implants will translate into strong demand for Regenerex as the material of choice for porous metal constructs. Turning now to extremities, sales increased 13% worldwide during the first quarter and increased 8% in the United States.  Extremity products that experienced strong worldwide growth during the first quarter include the Discovery Elbow, Copeland [Humal] Resurfacing Head, Comprehensive Fracture Stem, ExploR Radial Head Replacement and the Maestro Wrist Reconstructive System, as well as the test shoulder system which is available in Europe. The Discovery Elbow is a bone-sparing device that features an improved hinge design and utilizes an ARCOM direct compression molding polyethylene bearing.  The bone conserving propylene shoulder is a resurfacing system used to treat patients in the early stages of degenerative joint disease.  The comprehensive fracture stem is utilized to treat complex shoulder fractures, while the ExploR Radial Head Replacement continued to receive excellent market acceptance during the first quarter due to its modular design, including a tapered stem and a head design to articulate with the patient’s natural bone.   The Maestro Wrist can be used as a total wrist device for hemiarthroplasty for carpal replacement.  Test shoulder, which is contributing to extremity sales growth in Europe, provides for maximum bone preservation due to its anatomical design and requires only one instrumentation system or implantation of all designs included in the system, including hemiarthroplasty as well as anatomic and reverse shoulder prosthesis. Sales of bone cement and accessories increased 9% in the United States during the first quarter and decreased 11% worldwide.  These growth rates were up against last year’s growth of 9% in the U.S and 16% worldwide. Biomet’s Cobalt and Cobalt bone cements received good market acceptance in the United States during this past quarter.  Biomet’s Stage One Cement Spacer Molds continued to receive excellent market acceptance during the quarter, as the Spacer Mold offers surgeon an advantage over the conventional handmade and pre-made cement spacers.   Biomet initiated the rollout of the Stage One Cement Hip Spacer Molds during the fourth quarter and the full release was completed during the first quarter.  We offered wide webcast training sessions for the Stage One Hip Spacer Mold during the first quarter, with more than 100 individuals participating in the training. Now, let’s transition to dental.  During the first quarter, dental reconstructive device sales increased 11% worldwide and in the United States.  During the first quarter, a limited release for NanoTight surface technology was initiated for the Prevail and the straight wall Certain Implant designs.  Approximately 150 customers worldwide were invited to participate, with full product release planned for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.  NanoTight is a hydroxyapatite surface treatment that will initially be used on 3i’s Certain and Prevail Implant systems.  This technologically advanced surface treatment incorporates a discrete crystalline deposition of nanoscale calcium phosphate, which is applied to 3i’s existing OSSEOTITE surface substructure.   The treatment offers a marked improvement of implant integration performance in terms of the quality of the bone implant interface as well as the speed of Osseo conduction, providing a more rapid and predictable treatment. During the second quarter, 3i will focus on three key systems to drive growth during fiscal ’07, including: the straight prevail implant, the standard prevail implant and the enhanced NT, Natural Taper implant. Next we will turn to fixation sales.  Fixation sales decreased 5% worldwide to approximately $61 million during the first quarter and decreased 9% in the United States.  Internal fixation sales increased 1% worldwide during the first quarter and decreased 10% in the US.  External fixation sales decreased 11% worldwide during the quarter and decreased 16% in the US.  Electrical stimulation devices increased 8% worldwide and in the United States during the first quarter. New trauma products include the OptiLoc Periarticular Plating System, Biomet Vision Foot Ring System and the OrthoPak II.  The OptiLoc Periarticular Plating System’s proximal tibial plates will introduce during the first quarter.  During the second quarter, we plan to launch the OptiLoc system distal femoral plates which are designed for the fixation of lower extremity fractures in osteotomy.  Manufactured from titanium alloy, the distal femoral plates are anatomically contoured and incorporate the SphereLoc technology that allows either a locked or non-locked screw to be used in the same screw hole.  This comprehensive system offers color-coded implants and instruments for ease of use by the surgeon and the OR staff.  A third quarter launch of the Distal Tibial Plate is scheduled which will complete the lower extremity line. The recently introduced Biomet Vision Foot Ring system is a comprehensive external fixation system designed for the treatment of osteotomies, arthrodesis and fracture fixation indications.  This system offers a simplified snap-fit application of all fixation components to the Vision Ring  and can be configured into a multitude of constructs ranging from simple fractures to complex reconstruction.  The Vision Foot Ring System is made of a lightweight carbon fiber which has radial movement and also provides for increased patient comfort.  The OrthoPak II is a next-generation bone growth stimulation system for non-union fractures that offers rechargeable batteries for added patient convenience.  Additionally, a new foil specifically for finger fractures was launched. Craniofacial fixation sales decreased 4% worldwide during the first quarter and decreased 5% in the United States.  Products launched during the first quarter were the LactoSorb Pediatric Extraction device, the Thin-Flap low-profile cranial fixation system and the Sterile Track Neuro System.  Product introduction planned for the second quarter include the addition of longer screws, 14 and 16 millimeter to the SternaLoc product line for enhanced predictability and expanded out locations. Also scheduled for introduction during the second quarter is the Resorbable LactoSorb Pectus Stabilizer.  This is particularly important outside the US where the standard metal version of the Pectus Bar is not patent-protected.  The Resorbable version will differentiate the product in markets outside the U.S. and will be the preferred application for small frame patients throughout the world. In addition, we expect to introduce [Allogeneic] Plus during the first quarter.  This biomaterial combines our current lecithin-based Allogeneic demineralized bone matrix with pro-osteon granules resulting in an improved bone graft material.  By combing a scalpel with an osteo-inductive source into one product there will not be a need to subject the patient to a second procedure in order to harvest bone chips for use in the scalpel.  This also results in an economic benefit due to reduction in OR time that can be realized. Next, taking a look at the spinal product segment, sales decreased 6% worldwide to approximately $52 million during the first quarter and decreased 7% in the U.S.  Sales of spinal products and orthobiological products for the spine decreased 4% worldwide during the first quarter and decreased 5% in the United States, while spinal stimulation sales decreased 9% worldwide and in the United States. During the first quarter, the PEEK version of the ESL Elliptically Shaped Lumbar Spine System was launched in the US.  ESL's elliptical shape offers optimal surface contact with the [pitegral] body in place.  The availability of the ESL and PEEK material broadens the company’s product offering in the segment of the spacer market that addresses the direct posterior surgical approach. During the first quarter, we completed the rollout of the Polaris Spine System.  The Polaris is a next-generation Synergy Spine System offered in a 6.35 millimeter diameter top-loading rod system which utilizes patented helical flange locking technology.  Additionally, the rollout of the stainless steel version of the Array Deformity Spine System was introduced during the first quarter.  The stainless steel version broadens our product offering for the deformity correction system and builds upon the excellent early clinical experience of the original titanium version.  The Array System includes various styles of screws and rods for scoliosis correction.   The U.S. IDE clinical trial for the Regain Lumbar Nucleus Replacement pilot study was initiated during the first quarter.  The Regain is a rigid, one piece device made of pyrocarbon which is a highly compatible biomaterial.  The device is held in the disc space by the natural bony anatomy of the endplates.  The implant geometry is designed to maintain disc height and to provide for normal motion of the lumbar spine. We are expanding our osteobiologic product offering with the addition of the Biomet DBM platform.  Platform consists of freeze-dried sheets of de-mineralized bone matrix putty which can be hydrated using the Biomet Bone Marrow Aspirate Kit to produce a matrix that is osteo-conductive, osteo inductive and osteogenic.   During the first quarter, other product sales increased 5% worldwide to $43.6 million and increased 2% in the United States.  Arthroscopy sales increased 13% on a worldwide basis during the quarter and increased 6% in the United States.  [R Protect] products experienced excellent growth rates during the first quarter, include the EZLoc Femoral Fixation Device and the WasherLoc Tibial Fixation Device, as well as the InnerVue Diagnostic Scope System. Finishing up with soft goods and bracing, I am pleased to report sales increased 11% in the United States during the quarter and increased 10% worldwide. I would now like to turn the call over to Greg Hartman who will provide some financial details. Greg Hartman Thank you, Dan, and good morning.  Effective June 1, 2006, the company adopted the new accounting standard, SFAS 123 R Share-Based Payment using the modified prospective method.  In accordance with this adoption method, the company is not adjusting its historical financial statements to reflect the impact of share-based payments.  Adjusted results for the first quarter excludes the $0.02 per share impact relating to this accounting standard.  In connection with the $4.2 million expense relating to 123 R, $3.4 million is expensed in the SG&A line and $822,000 in R&D. The following discussion will focus on the company's results on an adjusted basis.  During the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, net sales increased 5% to $508.2 million.  Gross profit increased 5% to $369.4 million representing 72.7% of sales.  This is a 40 basis point improvement over the first quarter of fiscal year 2006.   SG&A expenses increased 5% to $186.6 million, representing 36.7% of sales.  R&D expenditures increased 13% during the first quarter to $23.5 million or 4.6% of sales.  Operating income increased 5% to $159.3 million with operating margins at 31.4% of sales representing a 20 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Net income increased 6% to $106.8 million while diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $0.44 per share. As far as the balance sheet is concerned, cash increased $32 million despite the $73 million dividend paid during the first quarter and the $7.2 million used to repurchase shares.  Accounts receivable decreased $14 million and days sales outstanding declined by four days to 88.  In the summer months when sales are softer, accounts receivable tends to decrease slightly.   Inventory increased $20 million during the first quarter and days sales and inventory increased 14 days to 349 days.  This increase is mainly in three areas:  Europe where a normal inventory build is planned during the summer slow months; 3i where the company is working to get out of a backorder situation; and Japan where the company is launching the Biometric XR and the Vanguard RP. Cash flow from operations totaled approximately $139 million during the first quarter.  With regard to the share repurchase plan, we repurchased 210,000 shares during the first quarter for an amount of $7.2 million.  Since December 2001, the company has repurchased approximately $32.6 million of its common shares for an aggregate cash amount of $1.064 billion. Dan Hann Thank you, Greg.  During the second quarter, we estimate foreign currency will positively effect results by $4 million to $5 million.  Consequently, we are comfortable with sales and earnings estimate of $519 million to $540 million and $0.44 to $0.46 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 respectively. I am pleased with the sales growth of the orthopedic reconstructive device category, particularly our knee product category which continue to experience strong market demand with double-digit growth during the first quarter of fiscal '07.  Biomet orthopedic continues to lead the market with the introduction of innovative products and technologies, along with its broad product portfolio of clinically-proven products.  As mentioned earlier, much work is being done to improve our trauma and spine operations and we are confident that these teams are capable of producing incremental top and bottom line improvement as we progress through fiscal year 2007. Thank you.  With that, we would like to open it up to questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator We will go first to Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities. Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities Thank you. Good morning guys. Just a few questions. In EBI, you mentioned reduced head count of since May of '05. Had the reduction been pretty consistent during that period, or is it more recently? Did that have an impact in this past quarter, since it looks like most of the EBI segments did take a step back sequentially? Dan Hann  A lot of the reduction has taken place this past quarter. This has certainly been a quarter of many, many changes, as you gathered. Admittedly, it was a difficult quarter. We were not making the progress initially we had hoped, so we started instituting more changes, beginning with Chuck Niemier taking over the Presidency of that operation. We've also eliminated some additional senior positions. We now have a new Vice President of Sales, which I mentioned; and a new Vice President of Finance, both of whom started during this past quarter, and a Vice President of Manufacturing, and Marketing.  But the Vice President of Sales has made numerous changes already during the quarter. We are turning over the lower end of the sales force, for example, putting in place new compensation plans. Frankly, we're making many difficult changes now, in order to grow sales and earnings in the future. As I mentioned before, going through the conversion of a new computer system this quarter, beginning to in-source our spinal hardware manufacturing, all of these changes create a great deal of disruption. But, yes, we have let go a number of people during the first quarter. Chuck Niemier  Just also to clarify, our sales force is down almost 5% in size and quantity, and that does make up a portion of the number that Dan referenced. Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities  Sure. Dan and Chuck, in terms of where you stand today, do you anticipate some changes to continue here in the near term, so that process is going to continue here in the near term? Dan Hann  Yes. We are continuing to implement change and we will throughout the entire fiscal year. I would not expect changes of the magnitude we've seen during this past quarter, but we will continue to implement change as needed in our Spine and Trauma operations.  Chuck Niemier  I would agree with Dan on that. Obviously we want to get the changes done as quickly as possible, so we're on a hard push to get over this part of the process so that we can stabilize -- stabilize is probably the key term -- not only within the sales force, but within our team in-house. Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities Great. Just changing course, with the artificial disks in the news this week. Can you just expand more on your comments regarding Regain? I think you mentioned it was a pilot study. So when would you estimate more pivotal, if that was what you said?  I think you mentioned that was lumbar, so what about on the cervical side? Dan Hann The Regain Lumbar Nucleus Replacement, we have started the pilot study this past quarter, actually late in the quarter, and that study will begin with 20 patients. Depending on the results of that study, it will move on to a pivotal study. In terms of the expected approval date, we're looking at 2011 as the earliest date for the Regain Lumbar. As to our cervical disk project, I think that as you correctly stated, that's the Rescue cervical disk. That will be the same regulatory process, and we intend to start the pilot study within the next ten to 12 months. There the expected approval date would be some time, if everything goes according to schedule, in about 2012. Chuck Niemier  To add to that also, the story of our competitors, they are going to get in the disk market, obviously quicker than we are. It's obviously not a situation that we're pleased with, but at the same time our competitors have gotten in on a quicker pathway, by acquiring technology from smaller start-ups farther down the regulatory pathway. We're looking at some opportunities now, and we're going to kick them around and see what makes sense, to see if we can't get to the market quicker than the dates that Dan emphasized. Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities Just lastly on that, it seems like those timelines are a bit of a push out. Is that right, and has there been any design changes, or what has happened in terms of the timeline there? Dan Hann  Well I think these timelines have been pretty consistent now for the past few quarters. We have not, to my knowledge, there are no design changes that we've implemented. I would also add we do have several posterior motion preservation projects in R&D as well. So that's where we are today. Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities  Got it. Okay, thanks, guys. Operator Our next question comes from Katherine Owen - Merrill Lynch. Katherine Owen - Merrill Lynch I just wanted to ask a question regarding your distributors. Dan, I know you had talked about changing some things in terms of requiring a minimum number of reps to get some better coverage out in the field. Has that happened yet? If not, when? Would it initially be disruptive, or would that be a relatively smooth transition when you go through that process? Dan Hann  Katherine, if I can ask for a clarification. Which sales force are you referring to?  Katherine Owen - Merrill Lynch  I'm sorry, I believe you were doing it on the reconstructive side. Dan Hann This year we are aggressively adding people on the orthopedic side. Frankly, it's been going very well. I don't have the specific numbers in front of me right now, but we're pleased with the growth and the programs that are being implemented in that area. We are giving incentives to our distributors from a commission point of view to add more reps, for example. Katherine Owen - Merrill Lynch Then just a clarification: with the 5% decline in the sales force, was that specific to the EBI division? Greg Hartman  Yes, yes it was. Dan Hann  Yes. It was specific to EBI. Katherine, I would add, a lot of that is self-inflicted. As we discussed last quarter, we're trying to lift up that sales force and you're going to have some natural churning of the bottom rung as you start to build it. Katherine Owen - Merrill Lynch  So just in terms of expectations, are you guys going to self-inflict for a couple more quarters? When do we think it would stabilize, versus starting to see net increases? Dan Hann  Well, in all honesty, I would not expect to see meaningful change coming out of Spine and Trauma until the back end of this fiscal year. Then as we start to drive the top line, I believe you'll see the earnings driven as well. Chuck Niemier  I'm repeating from the last question, I mean we're in a stabilization mode right now. We've had significant turnover in the sales force based out of Parsippany, and we've got to get it stabilized, we have got to get it trained, and we have got to get it appropriately organized and appropriately managed. Greg Hartman  But getting back to your Biomet orthopedics question, Katherine, our goal is to increase that sales force here in the U.S. by about 10% to 15% in 2007. Dan Hann One final thing, coming back to your self-inflicted question, again as I pointed out, this past quarter has been a quarter admittedly of many, many changes.  I would expect to see the self-infliction to ramp down, as we get greater into this fiscal year. Katherine Owen - Merrill Lynch  Great. Thanks so much. Operator Our next question comes from Milton Hsu - Bear Stearns. Milton Hsu - Bear Stearns Good morning, guys. Just specific to the Spine and Trauma businesses, do you expect negative growth all the way up until the end of '07, is that what you meant when you were just talking about the sales acceleration? Or is it going to be flat, low single digits? Dan Hann  Well, not having a crystal ball, and being in a very turbulent situation at this time, especially with all the changes we're making and the fact that we're trying to stabilize the sales force, if we can hold steady for the next couple of quarters, and then start to bounce, I think that would be a reasonable expectation. Milton Hsu - Bear Stearns  Okay. And then just kind of a big picture question here, as you stabilize the sales force, how do you do that without really strong, new product flow at this point in time? I know you're probably going to be able to launch a couple more new products as you mentioned through the rest of this year, I guess it's a question of what comes first, the chicken or the egg? Greg Hartman Well I would argue we do have a fairly strong flow of products into the EBI sales force, Milt. Dan Hann Yes, our issues and our problems within Spine and Trauma are not a lack of good, clinically proven products. We have bigger issues related to restructuring the operation and execution. If you look at our just this fiscal year in the Fixation area, where the OptiLoc Periarticular Plating System, we had a first quarter launch of the Proximal Tibial OptiLoc, in the second quarter we're going to launch the Distal Femoral OptiLoc, in the third quarter we're going to launch the Distal Tibial OptiLoc Periarticulating Plating System. In  the Spine side, we've got the Polaris, the ESL, and the Solitaire system, that will all continue to, we believe, to drive sales as we get to the back end of the year. Chuck Niemier  Basically, I think it's maybe not the chicken and egg, it's more of what do you want? Do you want a good sales force and bad products, or do you want good products and a bad sales force? Obviously you would like good in both courts, but where we're at, we have a very young sales force, and they need to be trained, and we also need to get the fundamental blocking and tackling. It's been a common or very favorite term around Parsippany the last two-and-a-half months, is establishing fundamental blocking and tackling. That goes from a standpoint of not only developing the product, but producing it, getting it rolled out, having appropriate inventory control applications, scheduling, forecasting, all the stuff that's necessary, I think is just good Business 101 practices. It was in existence, it's starting to develop, I do truly believe we're pulling together now as a team, instead of disjointed components. But it's a $400 million operation, and it takes a lot of inertia to get it moving all in the same direction. What is probably critical of the whole calculation of getting there is time. You have to be a little patient, to get us where we need to go. But as far as the situation exists, it isn't anything I personally haven't experienced in my almost 26-year career with Biomet. We've had similar issues throughout other divisions for which I've been responsible, and the team that we've assembled there, these guys understand what needs to be done and collectively we're pulling together to get there. It's just a matter of getting established. Probably one of the biggest issues facing us at this point in time is with my change of responsibility, I also inherited a conversion to a complete new computer system. It's been an agonizing process, it is a process I've also been through before many times. But for those of you on this call that have experienced similar situations, it's difficult. It has caused disruption, and it's going to continue to cause disruption for another month or two, but hey, we're getting there. The thing I'm most proud of is the combined effort of our Warsaw team and Parsippany team in working through this process, and probably for the first time in the history of Biomet that we've got these two entities working together, and I've really got to applaud Dan in is efforts and his vision towards globalizing and centralizing our management function. If it wasn't for that, we would not be anywhere near as far along as we are at this point in time. So that gives me great hope for the future, that we're going to get the ship righted and we're going to move forward. Now the last thing I'd want to emphasize, I know it's not specifically the question, is it's awful nice to be going through this transition, and not have a working capital issue. That makes it a hell of a lot more palatable and probably easier. So all-in-all, I'd say it's going to be a positive situation long-term, but it's just going to take a little time to get to where we need to be. Operator  Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan Thank you, good morning. Can we turn to the Recon business for a minute? Your U.S. Recon business, hips grew in FY06 8%, knees grew 15%, but this quarter hips grew 3%, and knees grew 11%. Maybe we can start just by talking a little bit about that, and maybe you can give us a breakdown between units, price mix, and instruments. Thanks. Greg Hartman  Well, for the quarter in the knee, 10% was units, 2% mix price, minus 1% in instrumentation. As to hips, 2% units, 2% mix price, minus 1% instrumentation. That's the breakdown for the quarter for the U.S.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan I want to make sure I'm modeling correctly the impact of anniversarying some of your launches last year. As Biomet rolls out, for instance, these instrumentation sets you obviously see a benefit, but then as you hit those comparisons, you're going to have a drag because of that as we see the growth rate. How does that instrumentation comparison look over the next couple of quarters? Dan Hann  It will be a headwind, Mike.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Any thoughts on quantifying? Dan Hann  Well, it will be specifically difficult in the fourth quarter. If you recall last quarter, we rolled out quite a few knee instrument sets here in the United States, with respect to the Vanguard Premier instruments. We quantified that, it was an 8 percentage point increase to our knee sales in the fourth quarter.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Yes, I'm looking at that right now. How do we think about the mix price component as we go forward for the balance of the year? Dan Hann  I think we would see that as fairly stable. Greg Hartman As Dan indicated earlier, we've been around the 2 percentage point or so over the last several quarters, and we really don't see that changing that much.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Okay. Just making sure we're think about the right pieces. As we step back from this quarter, obviously EBI had some issues for this quarter versus what expectations were, and overall that obviously impacted your performance. As we look at the next quarter and the guidance you've given, we're assuming overall that the company has some reacceleration. What drives that? How much is it just better performance by EBI, is it a pickup in Recon, what drives the acceleration? Dan Hann  I would say it's a number of things, improvements on many different fronts. One, we hope to begin making some improvement in EBI gradually. We continue to drive the knee market very well. I would expect to see that continue. I would hope to see a little pickup on the hip side of the market. As you may recall, coming midway through this fiscal year, we will have the Regenerex launch. We also are optimistic about the balance in Taperloc Microplasty stems. I would certainly hope to see a little pickup in the dental recon market, although the growth was acceptable this quarter, this past quarter that market slowed just a little bit, as did recon. So we would hope that the markets as we get in for the next couple of quarters, pick up just a little bit, which will boost our growth.  We continue to do well, for example in extremities, and I would expect to see positive growth continuing along our extremities line, and we continue to make progress in bone cements. Remember, we will finally get over our headwind that we've had in bone cements for the past few quarters, in the second quarter or third quarter of this year. Greg Hartman  That's correct. Dan Hann  We're optimistic about the progress as we move through this fiscal year.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan Just to be clear, the deceleration we saw in the U.S. hip and knee business this quarter, do you think that was an anomaly? Is that going to reverse? Greg Hartman  I think you have to look at that, and compare it to what the market did, Mike. If you look at our 12% growth in knees, that's almost a 400 basis point improvement compared to the market's growth last quarter in the U.S. of a little bit over 8%. If you look at our 4% hip growth, which as Dan indicated, we weren't pleased with in the U.S., that was only about 100 basis point shortfall compared to where the market was. So I think that if you benchmark against the market, we together did fine. Dan Hann  Also on the hip side, remember we grew worldwide for the quarter 7% constant currency against a market growth of 4%. So outside the U.S., our hip growth was very solid, and we want to continue to build on that.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Okay, my last question here, I apologize. The expectation going forward is that you'll continue to grow perhaps slightly above market, but that market growth will accelerate, or market growth will remain the same? Greg Hartman  We think that the market growth will accelerate.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Okay. Greg Hartman  Mr. Hann has to run to a board meeting here shortly, can we have just one more question. Operator We'll take our last question from Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  Thank you very much. Just a couple of quick questions. I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you reiterate your full year guidance that you provided at the end of the last quarter? And if you didn't, could you comment on that? Greg Hartman What we do, Bob, is in the fourth quarter we will give guidance for the first quarter of the next fiscal year, and for the entire fiscal year. We just -- in the press release, and in Dan's comments earlier -- gave guidance for the second quarter. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  So does that mean that the guidance you provided for the full year previously stands? Greg Hartman  Well, I trust that Wall Street's going to adjust things based on where we came in this quarter. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  Right -- no, I understand that those are two separate things. Guidance and where consensus falls out. So bottom line, you don't have any updated guidance for the full fiscal year? Greg Hartman  Like we said, we give guidance for that next quarter, and assume that Wall Street is going to put forth your own guidance, or your own estimates, I should say. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  I see. Got it. When do you think we can hear about clarity on the issue of current management structure, and the interim title for Dan right now, and just when will that be finalized, do you think? Dan Hann Well  I assume you've followed the press releases, but we did recently announce that our Board of Directors retained Heidrick and Struggles and McLoughlin and Associates, to assist the Board with the search for a permanent CEO. I think as I previously said, the Board is committed to moving expeditiously with this search, but unfortunately I can't give you a date certain that an announcement will be made. But please bear in mind that this is one of the most important decisions that a Board of Directors can make, so the Board is being deliberate, and they certainly have my full support. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers Great. Just two other really quick ones, back to Milton's question, what you're talking about for the Trauma and Spine business, what I think I heard is expectations for relatively flat growth over the next couple of quarters, and then an expectation that towards the end of the year, we might see a pickup in revenue growth. Is that what I heard? Dan Hann  Yes, I think that's what you heard. Greg Hartman  We also prefaced that with we don't have a crystal ball but that’s our objectives, and we're relatively confident that we're going to get there. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers Finally, on the U.S. hip number this quarter, do you think you felt any impact from Zimmer's wide diameter launch? Dan Hann  No, I don't think so. Again from a worldwide perspective, we were ahead of the market. We were down just a little bit compared to the rest of the market this quarter. No, I don't think so. Greg Hartman  I must have missed that press release, Bob. What did you say? Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  Just that the metal-on-metal wide diameter had been launched -- Greg Hartman Their large diameter, yes. Dan Hann  No, we haven't seen any, it has not had an impact. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  Okay. Thanks for taking the call. Dan Hann  Well thank you very much and with that, we look forward to speaking with you again during our second quarter call in December. Thank you again for joining us today.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator We will go first to Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities. Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities Thank you. Good morning guys. Just a few questions. In EBI, you mentioned reduced head count of since May of '05. Had the reduction been pretty consistent during that period, or is it more recently? Did that have an impact in this past quarter, since it looks like most of the EBI segments did take a step back sequentially? Dan Hann  A lot of the reduction has taken place this past quarter. This has certainly been a quarter of many, many changes, as you gathered. Admittedly, it was a difficult quarter. We were not making the progress initially we had hoped, so we started instituting more changes, beginning with Chuck Niemier taking over the Presidency of that operation. We've also eliminated some additional senior positions. We now have a new Vice President of Sales, which I mentioned; and a new Vice President of Finance, both of whom started during this past quarter, and a Vice President of Manufacturing, and Marketing.  But the Vice President of Sales has made numerous changes already during the quarter. We are turning over the lower end of the sales force, for example, putting in place new compensation plans. Frankly, we're making many difficult changes now, in order to grow sales and earnings in the future. As I mentioned before, going through the conversion of a new computer system this quarter, beginning to in-source our spinal hardware manufacturing, all of these changes create a great deal of disruption. But, yes, we have let go a number of people during the first quarter. Chuck Niemier  Just also to clarify, our sales force is down almost 5% in size and quantity, and that does make up a portion of the number that Dan referenced. Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities  Sure. Dan and Chuck, in terms of where you stand today, do you anticipate some changes to continue here in the near term, so that process is going to continue here in the near term? Dan Hann  Yes. We are continuing to implement change and we will throughout the entire fiscal year. I would not expect changes of the magnitude we've seen during this past quarter, but we will continue to implement change as needed in our Spine and Trauma operations.  Chuck Niemier  I would agree with Dan on that. Obviously we want to get the changes done as quickly as possible, so we're on a hard push to get over this part of the process so that we can stabilize -- stabilize is probably the key term -- not only within the sales force, but within our team in-house. Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities Great. Just changing course, with the artificial disks in the news this week. Can you just expand more on your comments regarding Regain? I think you mentioned it was a pilot study. So when would you estimate more pivotal, if that was what you said?  I think you mentioned that was lumbar, so what about on the cervical side? Dan Hann The Regain Lumbar Nucleus Replacement, we have started the pilot study this past quarter, actually late in the quarter, and that study will begin with 20 patients. Depending on the results of that study, it will move on to a pivotal study. In terms of the expected approval date, we're looking at 2011 as the earliest date for the Regain Lumbar. As to our cervical disk project, I think that as you correctly stated, that's the Rescue cervical disk. That will be the same regulatory process, and we intend to start the pilot study within the next ten to 12 months. There the expected approval date would be some time, if everything goes according to schedule, in about 2012. Chuck Niemier  To add to that also, the story of our competitors, they are going to get in the disk market, obviously quicker than we are. It's obviously not a situation that we're pleased with, but at the same time our competitors have gotten in on a quicker pathway, by acquiring technology from smaller start-ups farther down the regulatory pathway. We're looking at some opportunities now, and we're going to kick them around and see what makes sense, to see if we can't get to the market quicker than the dates that Dan emphasized. Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities Just lastly on that, it seems like those timelines are a bit of a push out. Is that right, and has there been any design changes, or what has happened in terms of the timeline there? Dan Hann  Well I think these timelines have been pretty consistent now for the past few quarters. We have not, to my knowledge, there are no design changes that we've implemented. I would also add we do have several posterior motion preservation projects in R&D as well. So that's where we are today. Steven Lichtman - Banc of America Securities  Got it. Okay, thanks, guys. Operator Our next question comes from Katherine Owen - Merrill Lynch. Katherine Owen - Merrill Lynch I just wanted to ask a question regarding your distributors. Dan, I know you had talked about changing some things in terms of requiring a minimum number of reps to get some better coverage out in the field. Has that happened yet? If not, when? Would it initially be disruptive, or would that be a relatively smooth transition when you go through that process? Dan Hann  Katherine, if I can ask for a clarification. Which sales force are you referring to?  Katherine Owen - Merrill Lynch  I'm sorry, I believe you were doing it on the reconstructive side. Dan Hann This year we are aggressively adding people on the orthopedic side. Frankly, it's been going very well. I don't have the specific numbers in front of me right now, but we're pleased with the growth and the programs that are being implemented in that area. We are giving incentives to our distributors from a commission point of view to add more reps, for example. Katherine Owen - Merrill Lynch Then just a clarification: with the 5% decline in the sales force, was that specific to the EBI division? Greg Hartman  Yes, yes it was. Dan Hann  Yes. It was specific to EBI. Katherine, I would add, a lot of that is self-inflicted. As we discussed last quarter, we're trying to lift up that sales force and you're going to have some natural churning of the bottom rung as you start to build it. Katherine Owen - Merrill Lynch  So just in terms of expectations, are you guys going to self-inflict for a couple more quarters? When do we think it would stabilize, versus starting to see net increases? Dan Hann  Well, in all honesty, I would not expect to see meaningful change coming out of Spine and Trauma until the back end of this fiscal year. Then as we start to drive the top line, I believe you'll see the earnings driven as well. Chuck Niemier  I'm repeating from the last question, I mean we're in a stabilization mode right now. We've had significant turnover in the sales force based out of Parsippany, and we've got to get it stabilized, we have got to get it trained, and we have got to get it appropriately organized and appropriately managed. Greg Hartman  But getting back to your Biomet orthopedics question, Katherine, our goal is to increase that sales force here in the U.S. by about 10% to 15% in 2007. Dan Hann One final thing, coming back to your self-inflicted question, again as I pointed out, this past quarter has been a quarter admittedly of many, many changes.  I would expect to see the self-infliction to ramp down, as we get greater into this fiscal year. Katherine Owen - Merrill Lynch  Great. Thanks so much. Operator Our next question comes from Milton Hsu - Bear Stearns. Milton Hsu - Bear Stearns Good morning, guys. Just specific to the Spine and Trauma businesses, do you expect negative growth all the way up until the end of '07, is that what you meant when you were just talking about the sales acceleration? Or is it going to be flat, low single digits? Dan Hann  Well, not having a crystal ball, and being in a very turbulent situation at this time, especially with all the changes we're making and the fact that we're trying to stabilize the sales force, if we can hold steady for the next couple of quarters, and then start to bounce, I think that would be a reasonable expectation. Milton Hsu - Bear Stearns  Okay. And then just kind of a big picture question here, as you stabilize the sales force, how do you do that without really strong, new product flow at this point in time? I know you're probably going to be able to launch a couple more new products as you mentioned through the rest of this year, I guess it's a question of what comes first, the chicken or the egg? Greg Hartman Well I would argue we do have a fairly strong flow of products into the EBI sales force, Milt. Dan Hann Yes, our issues and our problems within Spine and Trauma are not a lack of good, clinically proven products. We have bigger issues related to restructuring the operation and execution. If you look at our just this fiscal year in the Fixation area, where the OptiLoc Periarticular Plating System, we had a first quarter launch of the Proximal Tibial OptiLoc, in the second quarter we're going to launch the Distal Femoral OptiLoc, in the third quarter we're going to launch the Distal Tibial OptiLoc Periarticulating Plating System. In  the Spine side, we've got the Polaris, the ESL, and the Solitaire system, that will all continue to, we believe, to drive sales as we get to the back end of the year. Chuck Niemier  Basically, I think it's maybe not the chicken and egg, it's more of what do you want? Do you want a good sales force and bad products, or do you want good products and a bad sales force? Obviously you would like good in both courts, but where we're at, we have a very young sales force, and they need to be trained, and we also need to get the fundamental blocking and tackling. It's been a common or very favorite term around Parsippany the last two-and-a-half months, is establishing fundamental blocking and tackling. That goes from a standpoint of not only developing the product, but producing it, getting it rolled out, having appropriate inventory control applications, scheduling, forecasting, all the stuff that's necessary, I think is just good Business 101 practices. It was in existence, it's starting to develop, I do truly believe we're pulling together now as a team, instead of disjointed components. But it's a $400 million operation, and it takes a lot of inertia to get it moving all in the same direction. What is probably critical of the whole calculation of getting there is time. You have to be a little patient, to get us where we need to go. But as far as the situation exists, it isn't anything I personally haven't experienced in my almost 26-year career with Biomet. We've had similar issues throughout other divisions for which I've been responsible, and the team that we've assembled there, these guys understand what needs to be done and collectively we're pulling together to get there. It's just a matter of getting established. Probably one of the biggest issues facing us at this point in time is with my change of responsibility, I also inherited a conversion to a complete new computer system. It's been an agonizing process, it is a process I've also been through before many times. But for those of you on this call that have experienced similar situations, it's difficult. It has caused disruption, and it's going to continue to cause disruption for another month or two, but hey, we're getting there. The thing I'm most proud of is the combined effort of our Warsaw team and Parsippany team in working through this process, and probably for the first time in the history of Biomet that we've got these two entities working together, and I've really got to applaud Dan in is efforts and his vision towards globalizing and centralizing our management function. If it wasn't for that, we would not be anywhere near as far along as we are at this point in time. So that gives me great hope for the future, that we're going to get the ship righted and we're going to move forward. Now the last thing I'd want to emphasize, I know it's not specifically the question, is it's awful nice to be going through this transition, and not have a working capital issue. That makes it a hell of a lot more palatable and probably easier. So all-in-all, I'd say it's going to be a positive situation long-term, but it's just going to take a little time to get to where we need to be. Operator  Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan Thank you, good morning. Can we turn to the Recon business for a minute? Your U.S. Recon business, hips grew in FY06 8%, knees grew 15%, but this quarter hips grew 3%, and knees grew 11%. Maybe we can start just by talking a little bit about that, and maybe you can give us a breakdown between units, price mix, and instruments. Thanks. Greg Hartman  Well, for the quarter in the knee, 10% was units, 2% mix price, minus 1% in instrumentation. As to hips, 2% units, 2% mix price, minus 1% instrumentation. That's the breakdown for the quarter for the U.S.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan I want to make sure I'm modeling correctly the impact of anniversarying some of your launches last year. As Biomet rolls out, for instance, these instrumentation sets you obviously see a benefit, but then as you hit those comparisons, you're going to have a drag because of that as we see the growth rate. How does that instrumentation comparison look over the next couple of quarters? Dan Hann  It will be a headwind, Mike.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Any thoughts on quantifying? Dan Hann  Well, it will be specifically difficult in the fourth quarter. If you recall last quarter, we rolled out quite a few knee instrument sets here in the United States, with respect to the Vanguard Premier instruments. We quantified that, it was an 8 percentage point increase to our knee sales in the fourth quarter.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Yes, I'm looking at that right now. How do we think about the mix price component as we go forward for the balance of the year? Dan Hann  I think we would see that as fairly stable. Greg Hartman As Dan indicated earlier, we've been around the 2 percentage point or so over the last several quarters, and we really don't see that changing that much.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Okay. Just making sure we're think about the right pieces. As we step back from this quarter, obviously EBI had some issues for this quarter versus what expectations were, and overall that obviously impacted your performance. As we look at the next quarter and the guidance you've given, we're assuming overall that the company has some reacceleration. What drives that? How much is it just better performance by EBI, is it a pickup in Recon, what drives the acceleration? Dan Hann  I would say it's a number of things, improvements on many different fronts. One, we hope to begin making some improvement in EBI gradually. We continue to drive the knee market very well. I would expect to see that continue. I would hope to see a little pickup on the hip side of the market. As you may recall, coming midway through this fiscal year, we will have the Regenerex launch. We also are optimistic about the balance in Taperloc Microplasty stems. I would certainly hope to see a little pickup in the dental recon market, although the growth was acceptable this quarter, this past quarter that market slowed just a little bit, as did recon. So we would hope that the markets as we get in for the next couple of quarters, pick up just a little bit, which will boost our growth.  We continue to do well, for example in extremities, and I would expect to see positive growth continuing along our extremities line, and we continue to make progress in bone cements. Remember, we will finally get over our headwind that we've had in bone cements for the past few quarters, in the second quarter or third quarter of this year. Greg Hartman  That's correct. Dan Hann  We're optimistic about the progress as we move through this fiscal year.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan Just to be clear, the deceleration we saw in the U.S. hip and knee business this quarter, do you think that was an anomaly? Is that going to reverse? Greg Hartman  I think you have to look at that, and compare it to what the market did, Mike. If you look at our 12% growth in knees, that's almost a 400 basis point improvement compared to the market's growth last quarter in the U.S. of a little bit over 8%. If you look at our 4% hip growth, which as Dan indicated, we weren't pleased with in the U.S., that was only about 100 basis point shortfall compared to where the market was. So I think that if you benchmark against the market, we together did fine. Dan Hann  Also on the hip side, remember we grew worldwide for the quarter 7% constant currency against a market growth of 4%. So outside the U.S., our hip growth was very solid, and we want to continue to build on that.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Okay, my last question here, I apologize. The expectation going forward is that you'll continue to grow perhaps slightly above market, but that market growth will accelerate, or market growth will remain the same? Greg Hartman  We think that the market growth will accelerate.  Michael Weinstein  - JP Morgan  Okay. Greg Hartman  Mr. Hann has to run to a board meeting here shortly, can we have just one more question. Operator We'll take our last question from Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  Thank you very much. Just a couple of quick questions. I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you reiterate your full year guidance that you provided at the end of the last quarter? And if you didn't, could you comment on that? Greg Hartman What we do, Bob, is in the fourth quarter we will give guidance for the first quarter of the next fiscal year, and for the entire fiscal year. We just -- in the press release, and in Dan's comments earlier -- gave guidance for the second quarter. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  So does that mean that the guidance you provided for the full year previously stands? Greg Hartman  Well, I trust that Wall Street's going to adjust things based on where we came in this quarter. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  Right -- no, I understand that those are two separate things. Guidance and where consensus falls out. So bottom line, you don't have any updated guidance for the full fiscal year? Greg Hartman  Like we said, we give guidance for that next quarter, and assume that Wall Street is going to put forth your own guidance, or your own estimates, I should say. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  I see. Got it. When do you think we can hear about clarity on the issue of current management structure, and the interim title for Dan right now, and just when will that be finalized, do you think? Dan Hann Well  I assume you've followed the press releases, but we did recently announce that our Board of Directors retained Heidrick and Struggles and McLoughlin and Associates, to assist the Board with the search for a permanent CEO. I think as I previously said, the Board is committed to moving expeditiously with this search, but unfortunately I can't give you a date certain that an announcement will be made. But please bear in mind that this is one of the most important decisions that a Board of Directors can make, so the Board is being deliberate, and they certainly have my full support. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers Great. Just two other really quick ones, back to Milton's question, what you're talking about for the Trauma and Spine business, what I think I heard is expectations for relatively flat growth over the next couple of quarters, and then an expectation that towards the end of the year, we might see a pickup in revenue growth. Is that what I heard? Dan Hann  Yes, I think that's what you heard. Greg Hartman  We also prefaced that with we don't have a crystal ball but that’s our objectives, and we're relatively confident that we're going to get there. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers Finally, on the U.S. hip number this quarter, do you think you felt any impact from Zimmer's wide diameter launch? Dan Hann  No, I don't think so. Again from a worldwide perspective, we were ahead of the market. We were down just a little bit compared to the rest of the market this quarter. No, I don't think so. Greg Hartman  I must have missed that press release, Bob. What did you say? Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  Just that the metal-on-metal wide diameter had been launched -- Greg Hartman Their large diameter, yes. Dan Hann  No, we haven't seen any, it has not had an impact. Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers  Okay. Thanks for taking the call. Dan Hann  Well thank you very much and with that, we look forward to speaking with you again during our second quarter call in December. Thank you again for joining us today.
