The 2017 Outlook for U.S. Monetary Policy
 

 Speaking to the St. Louis Regional Chamber’s Financial Forum, President James Bullard addressed four key questions related to the economy and monetary policy in the coming year. He discussed, among other things, the current “regime” of low real interest rates on short-term government debt, the potential impact of the administration’s policies on those rates and on productivity, the likelihood of the economy overheating in 2017, and a possible reduction in the size of the Fed’s balance sheet.
