Now, I'll hand it over to Tony and Tim to discuss our third quarter and the state of our business. 
William Anthony Vernon 
Thanks, Chris, and thanks to everyone for joining us to discuss the puts and takes in our business through the third 
quarter of this year. Before we dive into our usual business update and our take in the dynamics in the past quarter, we 
thought it best to start today by quickly putting some context around the third quarter financials we just reported. 
That's because the atypical nature of last year's results masked the steady progress we're making in rejuvenating the 
best brand portfolio in food and beverage. We talked before about the extraordinary activities related to our spin-off 
from Mondelnz last year and the revenue imbalance that affected our reported results in last year's third and fourth 
quarters and then that imbalance is again impacting our year-over-year comparisons this year. It relates to the unusual 
but prudent ramp up of trade inventories we drove at the end of the third quarter last year. And how that compares to 
what is a more normal pattern this year. 
But let me turn it over to Tim to explain it more fully. 
Timothy R. McLevish 
Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. To illustrate how this played out, we prepared a breakdown of the significant 
revenue drivers in the third quarter. As the chart shows, we experienced a negative impact to vol mix of approximately 
3 percentage points. This was due to the comparison with spin-related shipments last year. 
If you recall, we shipped extra product to retailers to build safety stock just ahead of the systems changeover related to 
our separation from Mondelnz last year. Aside from this timing effect, extraordinary pruning also had a negative 
impact of about 1% during the quarter, and that's consistent with our previous guidance. Excluding those factors, our 
base business generated roughly a point of organic growth from vol mix. 
In the context of a North America food and beverage industry, that saw a half point volume decline in the third quarter, 
that's pretty solid performance. The chart also shows that this 1% vol mix gain was essentially offset by a 1% drag from 
lower prices. But I'd note that the 1% reduction in pricing included significant adjustments we've made to reflect lower 
peanut and green coffee input cost versus the prior year. Net-net, it was a relatively solid top line performance that was 
overshadowed by an unusual set of comparable numbers in the year ago period. 
And I'll hand it back to Tony. 
William Anthony Vernon 
Thanks, Tim. Now, let's turn to the more germane discussion of our marketplace and how we're operating in it. First, 
we've been getting a lot of questions about the state of the consumer. So what have we seen? During the third quarter, 
we witnessed the value consciousness of the consumer intensifying. This looks to be driven by a combination of 
factors: a prolonged decline in the labor participation rate; the burden of higher payroll taxes; and continued erosion in 
consumer confidence. 
We're seeing shopper trips down overall and especially down in the all-important stock-up trip. In fact, the only places 
where store traffic was up in the latest 52 weeks were in the club and dollar channels. Amazing. And in the latest 13 
weeks, store traffic was up only in dollar channels. With fewer trips, and even fewer large shopping trips, we see 
consumers with little interest or minimal ability to buy more than what they need for a given week or sometimes a 
given day. 
And that's translating into a decline in the lift we typically see from the incremental dollar of promotional activity. 
Given this backdrop, we conclude two things: first, this is not an environment that we or our industry can expect to

promote our way out of; and second, it reinforces the importance of the Kraft playbook: great marketing; best in 
industry innovation; good, better, best price value ladders; achieving low cost producer status and the critical principle 
of reinvesting $0.50 of every dollar of cost savings back into our brands and people over time. 
Now, based on those success factors, how are we doing? In a nutshell, we continue to make progress, but we've got lots 
more work to do. So, where do we see the signs of improvement? One is market share. Our shares are flat to growing in 
categories that make up more than 50% of our business. In 2011, we were holding or growing share in only 34% of our 
businesses. 
That figure was in the 40%s last year. This positive trend reflects applying our playbook to our brands one by one with 
discipline and having a high rate of success with fewer, bigger, better investments in innovation and marketing. 
One year ago, I talked about the need to bend the trends in three of our big businesses: coffee, Jell-O and Planters. In 
coffee, I told you that we needed to play effectively in all segments. So what have we done? Well, we grew an on 
demand with the introduction of Keurig compatible cups. We went on the air to tell our Gevalia quality story versus the 
competition in the premium segment. 
Thanks to those investments, we are now gaining share in all segments of coffee and the market overall. We expect to 
sell about $100 million of Keurig compatible cups this year, including some innovative cappuccinos, lattes, macchiatos 
that our consumers and our customers are giving five star rating, and we're doing all of this while closing long-standing 
cost disadvantages versus the category leader. 
Last year, I also talked about restoring Planters to greatness. Well, Mr. Peanut is back. We're driving solid profitable 
volume growth through a three-pronged strategy: great advertising and innovation; a strong branded focus on what 
many of you would call a commodity, dry roasted peanuts; and a significantly more efficient supply chain that's 
delivering higher quality products and quality returns. And I should add we have a great motivated team. 
Okay. Now, let's turn to Jell-O, as we've talked about in the past, we wanted to be out sooner with a rejuvenation 
program, but we didn't have the right campaign ready. An icon like Jell-O deserves a world-class program, and we've 
just launched the first round of our rejuvenation efforts into the marketplace. It's too early to add more color, but we're 
excited about the potential of contemporizing such an iconic snack brand. 
And where we have momentum, we've kept pushing, the reinvigoration of Lunchables continues, our cheese and dairy 
team is executing every element of our playbook across all of its great cheese and dairy brands. And our Kraft Mac and 
Cheese and Velveeta Dinners have more than held their own in the face of a highly competitive environment. 
In fact, on a year-to-year basis, each one of these great franchises is delivering strong profitable growth at least in the 
mid-single digits behind great marketing and innovation. Now, I've said it before, and I will say it again there is no 
such thing as a mature brand, only tired marketers. 
That being said, the reality is the percentage of our portfolio that's been rejuvenated is not yet at critical mass to offset 
the problem areas that remain. As a portfolio company, we are unlikely to bat a thousand and to have everything 
moving in the right direction all at once. 
Right now, in the U.S. six of our 17 largest franchises don't yet have the fundamentals in place to drive industry-leading 
profitable growth. And as a result, our composite growth as a company is still running below the broader North 
American food and beverage market. 
Now, let me briefly break these six down and the actions we are taking to improve. First, JELL-O, which was still 
down significantly in the third quarter, but as I mentioned, we just launched a new campaign, adjusted our price pack 
architecture and continued with work on the cost side of the equation to pay for it all. Oscar Mayer cold cuts, which 
we've also talked about in the past, it's improving sequentially but needs more innovation and strategic pricing to get it 
back where it needs to be. We have the right team in place to do that. 
Ready-to-drink beverages where we're actively addressing some packaging issues. Kraft salad dressings and 
mayonnaise, the recent price base competition and our focus on profitable volume have held us back from making a

level of brand equity investments that can grow the category and our businesses. 
And powdered beverages, particularly Crystal Light, where we underestimated the degree of cannibalization from a 
very successful meal platform. Powdered beverages continue to provide a unique consumer proposition and we need to 
go back and rebuild support. 
The good news is that we have the fire power to reinvest and turn these businesses around. And that's because our cost 
savings and productivity programs are fully on track. Now, I'm going to spare you the speech this time, but the gating 
factors behind rebuilding our portfolio are people and ideas. We continue to build the performance-driven collaborative 
culture we set out to create when we launched the new Kraft one year ago. 
And no culture is built without great talents. That's why becoming the best recruiter, trainer and developer in our 
industry is critical. As I have said before, we are running this as a marathon, not a sprint. We're confident we're on the 
right track, and we continue to make steady progress. Now, let me turn it back to Tim to discuss our Q3 earnings and 
update our guidance before we take your questions. 
Timothy R. McLevish 
Thanks, Tony. Moving on now to our EPS results, which for the third quarter were $0.83, up from $0.79 last year. 
There are three factors I'd like to highlight on EPS bridge. The first is the non-cash benefit of $0.18 per share for 
market-based impacts to our post-employment benefit plans. As we discussed on last quarter's call and is the case again 
this quarter, the voluntary early retirement program we put in place during the first half of the year triggered an out of 
cycle re-measurement for two of our largest pension plans. 
The impact of that re-measurement reflected higher discount rates and asset values. Given the significance of this 
impact, we were required to record these results in the quarter. And as is our normal cycle, we will be re-measuring 
those plans again in the fourth quarter. But there's no way to predict future impacts, so we have not assumed any further 
change within the 2013 guidance update I'll provide in just a minute. 
The second factor to note is the impact of lower volumes versus the prior year from the spin-related safety stock build 
we discussed earlier. As you can see on the slide, the change in earnings from operations was negative $0.02 in the 
third quarter, but this included a negative impact of approximately $0.04 on a year-over-year basis due to comparisons 
with the benefit we received from safety stock shipments last year. Excluding this factor, we continued to see our 
productivity and overhead savings come through. And finally, we experienced a $0.05 headwind year-over-year due to 
significant unrealized gains from hedging activities last year. 
Stepping back, while there were some puts and takes in the quarter, we remain on track with our full year guidance and 
speaking of which are the top line. We expect our fourth quarter growth will significantly outpace the market due to 
comparisons with an unusually weak fourth quarter last year. However, due to our performance through the first nine 
months and our continued focus on profitable growth, our full year organic revenue growth may trail that of the overall 
North American food and beverage market. And that includes the extraordinary product line pruning of about 1 point 
we've talked about before. 
At the EPS line, on an underlying basis, we're making no changes for our full year expectations. However, we are 
updating our guidance to reflect the additional $0.18 of non-cash benefit from the market based impact on our 
post-employment benefit plans I discussed earlier. 
We now expect to report earnings per share of approximately $3.58, up from approximately $3.40 previously. Now, 
you might have seen the string cheese recall we announced last week and wonder what the impact may be on our fourth 
quarter. As of right now, we believe the impact will be immaterial to our financials and manageable within the context 
of the guidance I just laid out. But we're still finalizing our analysis. 
And finally, we're on track to deliver free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. Working capital management and 
CapEx efficiency continue to deliver for us, and I'm proud that our organization continues to embrace our cash-driven,

return-focused decision making. 
I would also point out that by the end of the third quarter, we had made $600 million of pension contributions we 
announced a year ago. With that funding, higher discount rates and solid asset performance, I'm pleased to report that 
we ended the third quarter with our pension plans approximately 90% funded. 
Now, I'll turn things back over to Tony for a few final remarks. 
William Anthony Vernon 
Thanks, Tim. I'll close by saying that, as tough as the economy may be and as strapped as our key consumer is, we feel 
confident we're on the right track. 
Nobody likes to operate in this type of environment and we're not yet firing on all cylinders. But make no mistake; 
while we are pleased with the real progress we've made in productivity, overheads, cost, cash flow and market share, 
we will not be satisfied until we consistently grow our portfolio of great brands faster than the food and beverage 
industry. We are focused in taking the right steps to build our brands, our people and our capabilities with a mission to 
deliver long-term profitable growth and strong free cash flow. 
And now, we'd love to take your questions. 
Q&A 
Operator 
Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow from BMO Capital Markets. 
Your question, please. 
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Hey. Good evening, everyone. 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Hi, Ken. 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Hello, Ken. 
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: I have one just housekeeping question and then a bigger picture question. The hedges 
going away, the $0.05 impact, was that always part of your guidance or is that underlying operation is actually better by 
$0.05, you're just not including that in your forward-looking statements -- in your forward-looking guidance? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Actually, the $0.05 is a net year-on-year change. So, in fact, it was a hedge – a large 
hedge gain that we had in the 2012 period, the fourth quarter and it was a much smaller piece. So the decline was $0.05 
and, I mean, that was kind of anticipated. 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Ken, these things, they tend to even out over time, but we don't really budget in any sort 
of gain or loss at the beginning of the year relative to our guidance. 
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Okay. I just figured if you actually implicitly raising your underlying guidance by that 
$0.05 or not? It sounds like just a little thing I just wanted to make sure I understood that part of it. 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Well, again the $0.05 is the difference between what happened last year and this year. 
This year which you saw on the quarter was really just a $9 million favorability, so it really and in the grand scheme it 
doesn't really impact our guidance or what we expected to earn this year at all. 
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Okay. The bigger point, the big question I really actually wanted to get to is, Tony, can you 
talk about the cadence to which those six brands that you expect them to start to see a recovery, like which ones do you 
expect to see earlier in the year? And how it's going to play out to the next call it 6 to 18 months?

<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Yup, thanks Ken. I think to back up a bit. I often get asked this in the context of 
what percent of the portfolio is fixed and I would put that number at over 40%, it's up, it's doubled from maybe two 
years ago. I talked a lot about three categories that nobody thought could be fixed. Cheese and Dairy is on an incredible 
roll, Coffee who would have thunk it, three segments growing and a great on-demand venture in a growing category. 
And now Peanuts and Mr. Peanut and Planters are driving some great results. So, we take this one at a time with 
discipline. We don't release funds until on any project until we see adequate return on investment. And I'll be honest, 
my benchmark is our Canada business where two-thirds of our businesses and often 70% in a quarter are growing faster 
than their category in the industry, and it's made for top-tier performance over time. 
We still have ways to go, we got lots of brands with share of voice less than share of market, and we're still spending 
only about $0.65 on the dollar versus peers but we're taking them one at a time, and I think you're going to see it come. 
And it's a marathon, not a sprint. 
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Is any of these six brands sooner than later, is there any sort of priorities that we can 
actually start to see? As you said, we've seen a couple of these brands move in the right direction, will any of these will 
– which ones will we see first and which ones will we maybe see a little bit later? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Yeah. I mean, your Nielsens are my Nielsens, and you definitely are seeing it in the 
same share progress as I am. Each category is different. I think a meal Crystal Light challenge is a lot different with a 
great innovation than taking on a salad dressing category that has a lot of key competitors. So we prioritize and based 
on a return philosophy and whether they meet our hurdles for message, margin, materiality, and momentum. 
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Right. 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: And beyond that, it's talking competitively which I'd rather not do. 
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Great. I appreciate. Thank you. 
Operator 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Jason, are you there? 
<Q - Jason M. English>: Yeah, I'm here. Can you hear me? 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Yes. 
<Q - Jason M. English>: Oh, cool. Good. I was nervous there for a moment. Some questions on the coffee which you 
guys have highlighted the strength of market share. First, tactically, you listed off some Keurig compatible products 
that I haven't heard of before, I wasn't aware of in terms of some of the varieties. Are these new launches that are 
pending or new launches that have recently hit or have I just been missing them out there? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Yes. We just launched a line of new café style offerings. Cappuccinos and lattes 
under the Gevalia brand, gotten a lot of great customer feedback and some great distribution. So I don't think you're 
late. I just think we're getting them out there now. And it's a tribute to an R&D group that really has capabilities across 
every coffee segment. 
<Q - Jason M. English>: Sticking on coffee, one thing that surprised me was the deceleration in price. You have pretty 
sharp decline on a one year, two-year, three years stack however you look at it, especially since there hasn't been really 
any announcements of any other price cuts. Is this decline driven by the coffee side or is there pricing [ph] that's 
(23:55) on the other side of your beverage portfolio? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: It's really green pricing driven. It's, you know our philosophy and there's a big 
competitor here and obviously consumers are expecting some great coffee prices when the market goes the way it is.

<Q - Jason M. English>: And you made reference – sorry, last question and I'll pass it on. You made reference in the 
release too of pricing on [ph] fuel (24:24) pricing net of commodity costs for the overall business and for the segment, 
are you -are the competitive dynamics such that you actually need to price down ahead of getting cost relief? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Yeah. Let me – I want Tim to comment here on PNOC in general, but I want to talk 
about pricing power and the promotional environment. This is a strapped consumer and it's not surprising to see 
retailers doing a lot of price matching. But we and the rest of this industry, I think we need to continue to provide value 
and accommodate consumer needs. For us that includes our playbook of good, better, best price pack architecture, the 
offering value through quality, investing in innovation and marketing, small and large size packs that follow the 
consumer's budget. And when we get it right, even in a recession, and I point to cheese especially or Mac and Cheese 
and Velveeta, and even with a strapped consumer, we see growth in our brands and our categories. But I'll turn it over 
to Tim for more specifics on PNOC. 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Yes, so in general, I want to make sure that everybody understands PNOC. It's pricing 
net of commodities and it primarily pertains to those business where a high portion of the raw material component parts 
is from one single commodity. We endeavor to pass through price, consistent with those major underlying shifts in 
commodities. It's an imperfect science. There's market dynamics out there. We tried to fill in the timing gap to the best 
of our ability with hedging. And our philosophy there is hedge until we can price. 
But, again, as an imperfect, and I would say, we look at that over time, I mean if you went back to 2012, you would see 
that we were materially favorable on a PNOC basis, and you would see that on a year-to-date basis we're some 
unfavorable. The balance of the two years over which really is a reasonable period to be thinking about averaging it 
down. We're in pretty good shape. 
<Q - Jason M. English>: Thanks a lot, guys. 
Operator 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe from Stifel. Your question, please? 
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi, good evening. 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Hi, Chris. 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Hi, Chris. 
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Just had a question for you here regarding SG&A, which in the quarter was down. 
Now, I'm just curious, is that a shift in advertising at all or maybe you could talk about the underlying overheads or 
things that may be benefiting SG&A in the quarter? 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Yeah, I mean it's overwhelmingly positive from a cost reduction from an SG&A 
overhead reduction standpoint. The 2012 is a little bit unreliable because that was carved-out financials for the third 
quarter within Mondelnz. But nonetheless, our restructuring and our cost reduction, overhead reduction programs are 
really kicking in and contributing nicely. In fact, the advertising investment actually was up in the quarter, we'll say, 
strong double digits so it wasn't a reduction of advertising that's caused the reduction in SG&A. 
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And then, maybe. 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Because our goal is to be as lean as those St. Louis Cardinals. 
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: And hopefully, you have more than just 22-year-old pitchers to rely on, so. Okay, we're 
hoping for a win tonight. So, one of the questions I have for you, and, Tony, you gave some of the businesses – the 
brands of the portfolio that still needs to be fixed and I guess I wanted to be clear, are you at a stage now given the 
launch of new JELL-O products and the marketing that, is that a brand you expect or you hope that maybe next quarter 
or soon, you could start to take off that list, the one that still needs some work?

<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Yes. You know we're in this for the long term. That is a key brand at Kraft. You're 
not going to read results of rebuilding and reinvesting in a brand that's been underinvested in for a long time. Quickly I

we're almost two years past the point where the Starbucks business went away. So you've had an opportunity to kind of 
see how Gevalia fits in a premium strategy, kind of how your portfolio performs now or how it stacks up relative to sort 
of some of your competitors. 
And I know that we're hearing that there's some talk at least in the industry that you might be considering partnering or 
doing something more substantial in the premium end of the coffee category. So if you could just talk about how you 
feel about your premium strategy today, your product lineup today and whether or not there's anything to those talks? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Yeah, I – thanks, Bryan. I'd rather talk facts than rumors. And given the question, I 
want to give you facts. Kraft and McDonald's are out selling a test market as part of a comprehensive coffee 
collaboration in the U.S. We want and we want to work with McDonald's to help consumers enjoy McCafé premium 
coffee in the comfort and convenience of their own homes. 
This test will deliver McCafé in new formats. It'll be a multiple test market test including roast and ground bagged 
coffees and single-cup offerings in the coffee aisles of retail stores. You know McDonald's is a global icon with proven 
success, branding, innovation. They're a great partner to complement what is our vast coffee expertise, products, 
process and people to take the great McCafé brand to consumers in retail stores. And we look forward and we're 
excited about this upcoming test market. 
And we think it complements our offerings. You know we have Maxwell House. You know we have a strong Gevalia. 
We're in month 18 and we've exceeded our expectations. And you know about our K-Cup approach through Tassimo 
and Keurig compatible cups. We believe in coffee and we've been telling you how much we believe in it. And I hope 
that this action proves our commitment to this great category. 
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: It sounds like a really good positioning I guess in between Maxwell House and Gevalia. 
With McCafé, do you see it I guess in terms of the way you sort of studied it and thought about a rollout you see it 
competing against I would assume Dunkin and Starbucks in that sort of end of the market? Is that kind of where you 
see the positioning?

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll from Citi Research. Your question, please? 
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Great. Thank you and good evening, everyone. 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Hey, David. 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Hey, David. 
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: And apologies for the voice I'm sick so I sound horrible, but I'm doing fine. Yeah. The first 
question for you is what's the impact to the food stamp program change? Tony, in the past I know you've talked that 
this is important to Kraft's consumers. Can you share with us your thoughts about the impact? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Yeah. We share with the industry the GMA the belief that SNAP is an important 
tool in the fight against hunger and that it provides deeply needed assistance to American families who are struggling. 
It's very difficult to figure out what gets cut from SNAP and how it affects a family budget in our forecast. We do 
believe people have to eat. It remains critical for us in this environment to provide our good, better, best price value 
offerings in as many categories as possible and to make sure that we're serving the needs of all American households, 
big and small, rich and poor. 
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Okay. On beverage, you made those great comments about coffee but beverage profits were 
down quite substantially. Was coffee the reason why profits were down or was it powdered beverage or something 
else? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Yeah. I'd be careful of looking at a quarter-to-quarter because it's – there's 
seasonality in this category and it moves around quite a bit and it was a fairly, not a real big summer and we have some 
great summer beverages. But we saw some merchandising activity step up. We weren't able to supply last year if you 
remember. In terms of our Capri Sun business, we weren't getting the forecast right in those offerings, Capri Sun versus 
Kool-Aid Jammers. 
We saw a pretty high merchandising cost in the quarter that's more normalized frankly than what it was last year and I 
think that affected it more than say green coffee costs. 
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: And if I could just sneak one last point in for clarification, when you talk about pricing, I 
know you're rational, but do you think that pricing in the grocery store is irrational at this time? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Well, wow, I think this is a very interesting strapped consumer market where people 
are trying to drive volume and traffic in stores and you're seeing some irrationality, but it's not surprising given the state 
of the American consumer. So, I think we're all trying to do our best in what is a difficult market for building volume 
and traffic. 
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Thank you. 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: David, I hope you're feeling better and my advice is, let your wife answer the door for 
the trick or treaters. 
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: That would be helpful.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Your question please. 
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Hi. I was just looking at your bridge and I wanted to know aren't there still some 
dissynergies in your numbers this quarter? I think it was related to pension expense that you're absorbing. And I 
thought that those dissynergies might go away in fourth quarter maybe through restructuring programs. Can you talk 
about how that's impacting your numbers right now and maybe that's in that negative $0.02 change from operations? 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Yeah, Rob. It is embedded in the numbers we've reflected in operations. It's a 
combination of things. I mean it is costs associated with being a standalone company. I mean we have to have an 
independent treasury department, controllers department and tax department, et cetera. So, they were probably 
somewhere in the $100 million a year worth of what we will call standalone dissynergies. And while we will not make 
those go away, we said that we would lower our overall overhead and SG&A costs enough to more than offset that 
dissynergy component. 
And, first of all, fourth quarter, we will lap those costs so they, for practical purposes, will go away from a delta 
standpoint. But, again, you see that overall SG&A and overhead costs has declined overall and that's attributable to our 
cost savings initiatives more than offsetting the dissynergy piece. 
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Okay. But it bodes for a – it sets up a tougher comparison year-over-year, so how much do 
you think of those $0.02 was from the dissynergies? Was it all of it? 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Well, I mean in the third quarter, we were not lapping, so there is a piece but I would 
say there is a piece but I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm going to quantify it as the full $0.02 but I would say there was a 
piece of it- there's also quite frankly imbedded in there some restructuring cost that you see remaining in the number. 
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Right. 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Robert, what we did quantify, what Tim was talking about in the opening comments 
was, although it was $0.02 down in the quarter, you had a $0.04 headwind because of the additional volume that we 
shipped last year in the third quarter. So... 
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Yeah. 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: If you take that out, then you're actually up $0.02 year-on-year from a change from 
operations. 
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Okay. And just – can I ask a marketing question about Jell-O? I noticed that it's being 
televised on the World Series, mostly viewed by men, but the characters in the ad are men. I'm just wondering are you 
changing the target of the brand or is it the same target? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: No, same target and just a great media buy in the World Series that actually is 
watched by a lot of families. And you're going to see a lot of pool partners in that advertising that are not just men. 
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Okay. Thank you. 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Sure.

<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Tony, thanks for your thoughts on what's driving the added value consciousness at the 
consumer level. But just to revisit some of the factors and the dynamics that you cited, those all seem valid. But I guess, 
what I'm still wondering is why would the consumer environment have gotten measurably worse here during the third 
quarter? What sort of changed on the margin as far as you're seeing it over the past two months? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Yeah. I mean, I think you got to talk about confidence, right? Consumer confidence 
when it comes to this. You've got a government that closes. You've got gas prices that were quite high and spiked. 
Luckily, they're coming down now. Payroll taxes, still a falling labor participation rate and I think that there really is a 
lack of confidence in the consumer in this getting better and I think a lot of people have been out of work a long time. 
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: There's some momentum that builds even though the employment rate looks like it's 
ticking to a better place. 
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. And then just on a category specific level, I wanted to come back, Mac and 
Cheese has been a big contributor to your top line over the past year or two. You called out Velveeta growth here in the 
release. But in aggregate, it seems like we might be seeing the category lose a little bit of its momentum relative to the 
really strong growth it was generating from most of last year or two. Is that consistent with what you're seeing? And 
given your dominance in that category, do you think over the coming months that a bit more needs to be done to boost 
growth in that brand? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Yeah. I think we look at this as dinners, right? We have a big Velveeta dinners 
franchise and obviously the Mac and Cheese franchise which is critical to us. It's been a very competitive category, that 
I honestly look at positively because we and our competitors need to grow categories not just trade share. So you've had 
some new formidable entries that have been well supported and you see market share jump around a little bit. 
You know we went at it with Hamburger Helper with Velveeta. Now we're going at it with some of the offerings from 
some other people. This is a category that is critical to us and to the retailer and I think you'll see it hang in there. I 
think still think it's very well positioned in this market for – especially given a strapped consumer because it offers real 
value through product quality, our marketing and our innovation to compete. 
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thanks, Tony. Even absent the competition, it seems like the category as a whole 
may have lost a little bit of the volume momentum that it had. Is there something that needs to be done from an 
innovation standpoint? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: I always would tell you there's something that needs to be done from an innovation 
standpoint. And I think you'll see some great things coming from Kraft in the coming months. 
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thanks, again.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede from Kraft Foods (sic) [Jefferies LLC]. Your 
question, please? 
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Good evening, everybody. 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Thilo, you just joined Kraft Foods. 
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Well, I do appreciate the offer so I guess we'll talk about it offline. The first question I had – I'm 
still learning my new business I guess. Planters, I appreciate everything you've done around the brand. I'm wondering 
though can you quantify how much the changes in the competitive environment in the snack nut space has helped the 
brand?

<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Yeah, it's a fair question given the upheaval you see from time to time in some of 
these companies. I do think what's most important is, this category is hot. Protein is hot. Whether it's peanuts, cashews, 
almonds or pistachios, this is a place that's drawing a lot of interest. For us, we have a branded equity versus what is – a 
lot of private label competition and our point is to build differentiation and execute our playbook across the total brand. 
You know that we have – we're in an interesting cost position because we started in a place where we had a lot of 
runway in terms of our Lean 6 Sigma, our integrated business planning and what we can do in our plants. And we're 
seeing that pay off, and it follows our critical principle of reinvesting $0.50 of those cost gains into our brands and our 
people. 
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Okay. And then the other question I have was a little bit broader, but we have seen this weak 
consumer three, four years by now and it doesn't seem to get better. I recall Tony, you talked at CAGNY this year 
about the trifurcated consumer and not just the bifurcated consumer. How much does that impact how you prioritize 
your R&D? Are you focusing more on the good part of the good, better, best portfolio? Are you focusing more on 
value category for lack of a better term? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Yeah. It is a great observation and insight. And yes, if you looked at us and some of 
the competitors I respect the most, figuring out innovation in the good without sacrificing margins is a huge challenge 
and opportunity. And it has a lot to do with what we call price stack architecture. Interestingly, it has a lot to do with 
the fact that club and dollar stores are the only channels that are growing. 
Think about that. I mean think of all the outlets in America and traffic is only growing at club and dollar and think 
about why. Its price stack architecture and value that those two places own uniquely. So yes, you're right, your insight 
is correct and I think it's not just Kraft that has to figure this out and do a better job of it. 
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: And I apologize for the follow up but club and dollar are different consumer segment, right? Does 
that make the R&D challenge for you bigger because you have to go after two different segments or do you focus on 
one of the two of them? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Yeah. I turn it to the glass half full. I think great brands can straddle the different 
consumers that exist in these different outlets. And I would debate you a little that club is a different consumer than 
dollar. There's a lot of value in both of those consumer sets. But we've got to be able to get both ends pleased. 
And we think that when we do it right, and you've seen the brands we do it in, interestingly, a Mac and Cheese or a 
Velveeta does very well on both ends of that spectrum, whether it's a dollar cup of Mac and Cheese or the large sizes 
that offer real family value. 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: That's the difference is it's probably more of a packaging statement than it is a product 
statement. Difference between club and dollar probably is a different package size and configuration. And we're 
working on that. 
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Okay. Perfect. I appreciate the time. Thank you. 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: You bet. 
Operator 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard from Stanford Bernstein. Your question please. 
All right. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Your question please. 
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Well, it's better than the fire drill we had on Mead Johnson last quarter. Tony, you cited that 
the difficulty in getting the bang for your buck on your promotions, and Nielsen data suggest this is true across the 
board in food. I guess I'm not quite sure I understand this phenomenon, though. My expectation would have been the 
cash-strapped consumer would maybe respond better to deals than usual. So I'm just curious how to think about that.

And then as a side question, how are you faring in terms of returns on advertising? Are you getting the sales lift from 
that expenditure you'd normally expect there? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Yeah, great. Thanks, Ken. So, hey, the first answer I'll give you, imagine a food 
class of trade with traffic declining, and putting out the same promotions and even more attractive promotions with less 
people coming through their store. And then added to a consumer behavior that has really changed, we describe this as 
consumers using stores as their pantry. When you and I grew up in Philadelphia, our moms had a pantry full of 
products. 
Today, moms have maybe a day or two, and in some cases, nothing in the pantry. They're buying day-to-day. So what 
you have is traditional promotion behavior on the part of the customer and us, and less people to walk into that store 
and buy it, and less commitment to fill their pantries with product. So the typical pantry load promotion doesn't seem to 
work as well. So that's my. 
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: No, that's helpful. 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Behavioral. Advertising is a key question. I'm a big believer in equity advertising. I 
think it continues to work in this environment. I hate to think what would happen if we stopped advertising. We've 
obviously got to be better at the effectiveness of those ads because it's a totally different consumer and a totally 
different media. I mean, it's online. The millennial doesn't really watch TV. 
But they still want brands and they still want good value for the money, and they still believe in brands that have 
critical advantages. So when we get it right, Philadelphia cream cheese or Velveeta advertising, we're still getting the 
great paybacks on advertising. It's making sure that we really do this with a discipline. 
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: And then one more if I can, I realized you're not going to provide specific guidance for 2014, 
but a couple of quick questions: first, are you still expecting the same benefit or I guess change in restructuring charges 
versus 2013 that you previously guided to? And second, are there any other headwinds and tailwinds, just qualitatively, 
we should be thinking about as we look forward to next year? Maybe items we are not necessarily thinking about, 
non-recurring items, for example? 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: No, Ken. I don't anticipate any material – other items affecting the year at this juncture. 
And yes, the step down from restructuring will probably go out of this year with some $300 million. And as we've 
communicated in the past on an ongoing basis, we're closer to $125 million so you should expect to see the benefits of 
that step down. 
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: That's very helpful. Thank you. 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Thanks, Ken. 
Operator 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Your question please. 
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good evening. Just two questions for me, I guess. First, just thinking about the fourth quarter 
for a minute, you expect organic growth to well outpace the rate of market growth. Last year, organic growth I think 
was down some 7% or so and I think half of it was due to the pull-forward of inventory into the third quarter and half 
of it was just I think additional inventory draw down at retail, if I recall right. So, do you get all of that back in the 
fourth quarter such that in organic growth is up high-single digit or are there some other things in there that impacted 
that I'm not aware of? 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Yeah, I'll start off by saying it's not our practice to provide point estimates on quarterly 
numbers. Last year, as you point out, was a particularly unusual quarter with significant drawdowns on retail 
inventories in addition to the impact from our separation-related third quarter build. The best I can say is that, certainly, 
we would expect that the – what we call project Gemini, the separation related should come back to us.

Page 14 of 18 
The inventory drawdown, we think we went out of the fourth quarter last year and we think we went into the fourth 
quarter this year with pretty normalized levels. So, I would think of kind of low single-digit as the level. Although 
Chris Jakubik is kicking me for giving any numbers here, but low single-digits is probably where we would expect to 
be kind of makes up for the Gemini related and some normal growth. 
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: And thanks for that. And then, Tony, maybe I could just push back a little bit on some of the 
PNOC commentary from earlier in the call. Only because you pushed back quite hard on us or at least me sometimes 
for ever suggesting Kraft is more of a kind of a pass-through business. And I know that you're trying to get it so that 
less and less of it is over time. But certainly of late and let's say you call it this year, it seems to be behaving more like a 
pass-through business, right? 
Given that pricing is coming down ahead of where lower commodity costs may be flowing through the P&L and things 
of that nature. Are we talking about just we're in an extraordinary environment here that is putting that level of pressure 
on things and that underlying things really have changed for the better from a pass-through perspective? Or I'm trying 
to come to terms with that because that's one of the big things that even during the separation, I think folks were trying 
to get a better handle on in terms of the portfolio and what it was really ultimately capable of? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Yeah. Fair. I twitch every time you say that pass-through word. So here's my 
answer. I mean, obviously, we're in categories that some might call pass-through by virtue of commodity kind of 
behavior. And it's meat. And it's cheese and dairy. And it's coffee. And it's nuts, right? If you look at even before the 
spin, the last two years, cheese and dairy across all of those categories, margins are up. Volumes up. Share is up. 
Dollars are up. We're working on dollars not margin percent, right? If you look at Planters of late, and I think it's the 
start of a bend the trend, same story. If you look at coffee, same story, right? 
Now, there are a lot of factors here, Andrew, and we do have this wind at our back called productivity that we were at 
the right place, at the right time, and I think did the right kind of be your own activist things. But the last thing I want is 
to believe that I don't have the same opportunity to grow great brands that you might call pass through, and I would just 
call great brands. Is Philly a commodity? I don't think so. Is Planters? I don't think so. I'm the only one with a Mr. 
Peanut heritage and it seems to still have value. 
So, we're going to always have this debate, but I think it's important never to look at PNOC in a quarter and/or the year. 
It's important to look at it in a stacked two-year way and on that benefit – or in that analysis, I think the PNOC 
discipline is working in what you would call our pass-through categories. 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: I'll agree with what Tony said and well, I can't give you all of the specifics, but if you 
really look at a two-year look from 2012 and 2013, you would see a very different picture from what you look just at 
this quarter. You would see actually that we're favorable on a two-year basis overall. 
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Okay, great. Thanks for your perspective. 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner from Wells Fargo. Your question, please. 
<Q - John Baumgartner>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Tony, coming back to Oscar Mayer, lunch meat remains weak as 
you pointed out in your comments. But I mean now you have some new leadership installed with Sam coming on 
board. So if you could, is there anything in particular that you can maybe point to in terms of where you think 
execution could maybe be different or better? And maybe what changes investors likely to see with the new leadership 
coming onboard? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Yeah. First, let me say something about leadership changes. Oscar, by the way, this 
is sort of the tyranny of when you look at quarters or one year. If you look at the last seven years of Oscar, Nick

Meriggioli you would say is a hall-of-famer in the world of marketing. Oscar outgrew almost every – well, it outgrew 
all the competitors in its business and most food and beverage. 
It's been a tough cold cuts year, but I don't want to miss fact that it's been a great bacon year, it's been a solid hotdog 
year, it's been an incredible Lunchables year, right. All of those basically lunch meat kind of franchises. What's going 
on in cold cuts is a very interesting phenomenon and that is a big competitor comes in and I named them Tyson, right 
and grabs the low end of the price point, formidable one, we probably should have acted sooner. I've said that. And 
importantly, great marketing by these deli competitors and you know their names. 
I don't want to give them too much credit. But we've seen four share points move from the processed lunch meat to the 
deli counter. We actually experienced this 10 years ago long before me and Nick Meriggioli at the time bought them 
off and grabbed those four share points back. Well, now that Nick he has 10 years on the business, we have a chance 
with Sam to have a meat guy who bring some fresh eyes a different way of looking at it after a great run by the current 
team. 
And I think you're going to see us doing some of the things out of the old playbook and some new things to grab back 
that cold cuts share. It is a critically important business to us and to the retailer. It's a big part of Kraft and it's been 
something we built a lot of growth on over the years and are looking at a tough 15 months or so. But I do believe 
sequentially you're seeing improvement and you're going to see innovation and strategic pricing moves to improve it 
even more. 
<Q - John Baumgartner>: Great. Thanks, Tony. 
Operator 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman from Deutsche Bank. Your question please. 
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Good evening. 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Hi, Eric. 
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Tim, is this your last one? 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: We'll see. Perhaps. 
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: All right. Well, if it is, it's been nice working with you. Best of luck. 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Thank you. 
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: I guess on – just two questions. One, it seems like gross margins kind of moved down quite a 
bit in the quarter both year-over-year and sequentially. Is that just a function of the fixed cost absorption? And why 
wouldn't all the cost savings kind of offset that or is there some kind of negative mix? Maybe you could help me with 
that? 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: I mean the large piece of it, we saw a relatively modest decline but a decline 
nonetheless. First, I want to point out that you do have a movement that we've said before. We're very focused on 
margin dollars and that would pertain to the gross margin level as well. So, to the extent you have movement in 
underlying commodities and therefore pricing, that will impact that. And also, we're focused on a much longer period 
than just a quarter. 
But having said that, yes, the additional absorption of a whole array of different things manufacturing cost and actually 
down in to some of the trade would have had an impact when we pick up all that additional volume from what we did 
in the end of the second quarter for that inventory build and the trade. That was the biggest piece of it I would say. 
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And is that – was the quarter, did you have lower input cost in the quarter 
year-over-year?

<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Again, we're focused on a PNOC basis and on balance our PNOC was some 
unfavorable in the quarter. So that's a bit how we think about it. 
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Our field costs were actually higher year-on-year Eric. What you saw come through 
was just – it seems the – to ship ahead in the fourth – in the third quarter of last year provided quite a bit of favorability 
and if you look at – if you really focus on the margins, you'd notice that the Q3 gross margin last year was the highest 
that it's been in recent history and that was really the extra volume coming through. 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Well, I mean, when you think about this year, that's probably a little bit more 
normalized. Obviously, we'll continue to endeavor to improve it as we drive costs and productivity, but this is probably 
a bit more normalized than thinking about last year as normal. 
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And then I guess to Tony with regard to next year, I know that you got this kind of 
windfall of less restructuring savings to the extent that you're focused on GAAP and that's going to make your EBIT 
growth the way some people model it and the way I guess you have suggested to be much stronger than your long-term 
targets. But given the state of the consumer and what sounded like a lot of price competition in some key categories 
like salad dressings and others, why wouldn't you kind of spend some of that back into the market more aggressively, if 
again your long-term target is kind of mid-single-digit EBIT growth? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Well, you're talking to a marketer about spending more aggressively. And I'm – by 
the way, I'm always careful, Eric, to talk about equity spending because of the time that I slipped and you told me that I 
was going to increase the spending and promotion which I won't do. But I – hey, you know what, we're... 
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Probably Lazar, it was Lazar. 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: But Tim and Terry, I'm going to be fighting the battle you just described. When I 
got margin, materiality, momentum and message, and the last one's the hardest. On my side, I want to reestablish 
spending in my great brand portfolio. I don't have Maxwell House back on the air to any great degree. And imagine, it's 
a $1 billion brand, or an $800 and some million dollar brand. And I got lots on my hit list for as we create the virtuous 
cycle, less spend. 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: I agree with that, with Tony. I would point out though that we need to make sure that 
we have all of the Ms lined up and that we're going to generate a good return on those investments. So I would say, 
generally that's been our constraining factor more so than the dollar availability. 
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay, well that's enough. Thanks. 
Operator 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alicia Forry from Canaccord Genuity. Your question please? 
<Q - Alicia A. Forry>: Hi, good afternoon. Can you hear me all right? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Yup. 
<Q - Alicia A. Forry>: Okay, great. We've heard from a few companies this quarterly reporting period that the North 
American consumer market is changing faster, excuse me, than companies have expected and that seems like you're 
echoing that a little today. Do you think that you have not only the innovative ideas around packaging and pricing and 
so on that you've mentioned but also the internal systems in place to allow you to react to the challenging market 
dynamics? And if not, what can you realistically do to improve and shorten your reaction time to unexpected consumer 
behavior movements? 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: So the headline is, yes, we think we have the people, the processes, the products in 
place to compete even in this tough environment. Just to echo some of your assumptions, I do believe that those people

that are talking to you are right. I do believe it's a tough environment. I do believe the momentum is building, 
especially in fourth quarter, because of this reduction in SNAP that has been talked about and is real. That starts 
basically right now. And some have talked about this, and I think it's a factor that you can study that the holidays are 
tighter, late Thanksgiving to Christmas than they are six out of seven years, right? And that means one less paycheck 
for a lot of people, and one less paycheck in this environment is a big deal. 
So short-term winds in our face. Nobody loves it, but we operate in it, and we believe our playbook, price pack 
architecture, good-better-best offerings to offer value and investing for the long term in innovation and marketing and 
advertising are the right way to compete. We also believe we have some very important family food products that they 
can't live without. So we've got to make them affordable and make sure we have the offerings they need. 
<Q - Alicia A. Forry>: Okay. Thanks. And then if I could just have one quick follow-on, promotional levels 
year-on-year. I think you mentioned in the last quarter that for you, they were down 8% compared to an industry that 
had promotional levels down a little over 1%, I believe. I was just wondering how that developed during Q3, if you 
could give us any numbers around that. 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Yes, it's more normalized and I think I mentioned one of our big brands was sort of 
out of stock last third quarter. 
It was back in stock, Caprice Sun this quarter and so we merchandised it because it's in season. So you saw a more 
normalization for us but we still remain committed to being rationale, to remain – to keep our focus on profitable, 
sustainable growth and to make sure that we use promotion as only one lever to adjust the price points that are 
appropriate for some of our brands but more importantly that we spend the bulk of our money against long term equity 
building in our brands. 
<Q - Alicia A. Forry>: So the industry wasn't more promotional necessarily or at least significantly – not significantly 
more promotional in Q3 versus... 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: There's always quite a bit of price matching going in our retailers, and that's a 
reaction to a strapped consumer and in the end we kind of all pay for that. So I don't have the exact promotional spend 
quarter-to-quarter but we could follow up with you. 
<Q - Alicia A. Forry>: Okay. Thanks. 
<A - Christopher M. Jakubik>: All right. Maybe we can take the last question now. 
Operator 
Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Alexia Howard from Sanford Bernstein. Your question, please? 
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Good evening, everyone. 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Hi, Alexia. 
<A - Timothy R. McLevish>: Hi, Alexia 
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Hi, sorry about the technical glitch earlier. I'm in a hotel room in Glasgow where the 
lights went out and phone went dead. I'm still here in the dark. I wanted to ask about new products as a percent of sales. 
At CAGNY earlier this year you reported you had a fantastic ramp up on new products as a percent of sales between 
2009 and 2012. It seems as though cannibalization slowed down in certain categories and some of your really good new 
platforms has begun to kick in. Do you think that's 13% of sales as the proportion of new products is a sustainable 
number? Is that – when we get into 2014, 2015 and it will be at the level or even higher and do you feel that you got the 
product innovation pipeline will allow that to continue? Thank you. 
<A - William Anthony Vernon>: Yeah. Thanks, Alexia. It is a critical part of our strategy to double that innovation 
percent and be consistent about it from mid-single digits to low double digits. And you've seen – I've talked about the
