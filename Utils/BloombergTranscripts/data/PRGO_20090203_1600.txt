MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION 

Joseph C.Papa, President, CEO and Chairman 

Business Highlights 

Let me get started; in Q2 FY 2009, we continued to demonstrate strong top line growth in our core consumer healthcare 
OTC business, while we work to mitigate the challenges in our other business segments 

We achieved record sales led by our over-the-counter business 

There were three main drivers for OTC business success: 

• 
First, new products 
• 
Second, an increasing acceptance of store brand over-the-counter products 
• 
And finally, our recently-completed strategic acquisitions 
New Product 

• 
Let’s start with a quick review of our new product sales 
• 
New product sales were $84mm in the quarter as omeprazole, cetirizine and Famotidine Complete continued to 
perform well 
• 
I am very pleased with the work our team has done to deliver an increasingly broad portfolio of quality, 
affordable product offerings through our retailer shelves 
Store Brand Acceptance 


• 
Our second top line growth driver is store brand acceptance 
• 
As a perspective, the overall domestic OTC consumer market increased 4% in the quarter vs. last year 
• 
However, nationally advertised brands are essentially flat y-over-y 
• 
During the same quarter, store brands gained nearly 17% 
• 
In Perrigo, sales gained 39% on the strength of new product launches and increased market share 
Growth Rate 

• 
New product launches contribute to our growth rate to be clear 
• 
But, as several retailers have also commented, store brands are gaining market share 
• 
For example, analgesics is a major OTC category that has not seen significant new product innovation in 
the few last years 
• 
The category as a whole has remained relatively flat y-over-y 
• 
In this same time period, national brands fell more than 2% during the quarter vs. last year, while store 
brands in the analgesic category grew more than 5% 
• 
This demonstrates that consumers are recognizing the value of store brands in a challenging economy and 
that Perrigo is uniquely positioned to deliver that value to consumers 
• 
One other consideration, the FY 2009 Q2 growth in our store brand business occurred in an environment that 
retailers reduced their Perrigo inventory or day sales on hand by 8% vs. the same period last year 
• 
So we got growth in a time period where inventory on hand at the retailers is down 8% 
• 
Our fiscal second quarter results in our consumer healthcare business show that we continue to maintain our 
focus on delivering quality, affordable healthcare products to meet the world’s growing need 
Strategic Acquisitions 

• 
The third key driver is strategic acquisitions 
• 
We executed a pair of strategic acquisitions 
Acquisitions of Diba and Unico Holdings 

• 
At the beginning of Q2, we acquired Diba for approximately $25mm 
• 
Based in Guadalajara, Mexico, this store brand manufacturer of OTC and prescription products helps make us 
the leading store brand manufacturer in Mexico 
• 
We expect the acquisition to add approximately $15mm of annual sales in a country where store brands 
represent today less than 8% of the OTC category, but are growing very quickly 
• 
Perrigo is now the leading store brand manufacturer in the U.S., Mexico and the U.K. 
• 
We will continue to look at growing internationally 
• 
On November 13, we acquired Unico Holdings for approximately $52mm in cash 

• 
Based in Lake Worth, Florida, Unico is the leading manufacturer of store brand pediatric electrolytes, enemas 
and feminine hygiene products for retail customers in the United States 
• 
We expect the acquisition to add approximately $50mm of annual sales and is accretive to earnings in the first 
12 months 
Product Mix and Short-Term Investment 

• 
Now, with all those positives, there is another issue that I want to briefly address, and that is the decline in our 
CHC FY09 Q2 gross margins 
• 
This was driven by two factors 
• 
Product mix, where we saw an accelerating sales of our lower margin vitamin and nutritional products 
• 
And a short-term need to invest in external manufacturing output to meet the rapid increase in demand for 
these products 
• 
Judy will provide additional details on this topic 
Conclusion 

Also, while Consumer Healthcare has been growing, API has had a very challenging H1 the FY as Judy will explain in 
detail in a few minutes 

H1 sales weakened almost 10% from the first two quarters last year as a result of reduced sales of two key products as 
well as slower demand for others 

• 
We are managing through these challenges by focused cost-cutting initiatives and new pricing strategies 
Judy L.Brown, EVP and CFO 

Financial Highlights 

The team has worked hard this quarter capitalizing on our strengths and adapting to changing market conditions in a 

dynamic economic environment 
In the next few minutes I’d like to provide you some quick highlights of the financial results for the quarter and help 
provide you better detail to understand why we see that growth continuing, and the basis of our financial expectations 
for the remainder of the year 

Y-over-y, we had a strong quarter 
Consolidated net sales increased 29% to $561mm, led by $84mm in new product sales across most of the businesses 
Consolidated GAAP gross profit was $154mm, up $24mm or 18% from last year 
Consolidated GAAP net income was $25mm, down $34mm from last year 
Consistent with our historical practice of providing results on an adjusted operating basis, consolidated adjusted net 

income was $42mm, up $8mm or 25% from second fiscal quarter 2008 

Auction Rate Securities 


• 
Before reviewing our operational results, I’d like to highlight those items that have been excluded from our 
analysis of the quarterly financials on an adjusted operating basis, consistent with our historical treatment of 
similar items 
• 
Starting with the most material item this quarter, we incurred a charge of $15mm or $0.16 per share related to the 
write-down of auction rate securities purchased in Israel from Lehman Brothers 
• 
These assets were written down from a face value of $18mm and continue to be held as non-current assets 
• 
While we had discussed the fact that the market for these securities has been illiquid for over 12 months, the 
credit worthiness of the underlying issuer continue to deteriorate significantly in our fiscal second quarter as 
concluded in a formal valuation completed in January 
• 
As a result and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the impairment of these securities can no longer be considered 
to be temporary and so we have reduced the carrying value of these assets to our best estimate of their current 
fair market value 
Acquisitions of JB Labs, Unico and Diba 

• 
In addition, we had several smaller charges related to our acquisitions of JB Labs, Unico and Diba 
• 
We incurred charges to cost of sales of $1.4mm after-tax or $0.02 per share for the value of step-up in inventory 
for these three acquisitions as well as the charge of $200,000 after-tax for the write-off of in-process research and 
development related to Diba 
• 
In addition, we had a charge of $1mm after-tax or $0.01 per share related to the impairment of certain fixed assets 
within consumer healthcare 
• 
In total, these items had $0.19 per share impact this fiscal quarter 
• 
We did not have any such items in the fiscal second quarter 2008 
• 
You can view the reconciliation from the reported GAAP numbers to our adjusted non-GAAP numbers in Table 
2 of the appendix to our press release 
• 
With that behind us, I’ll take you through the financial analysis of our fiscal second quarter based on adjusted 
results, that is, GAAP reported figures excluding the previously mentioned charges 
Net Sales, Gross Profit, Operating Income & Margin 

• 
Consolidated second quarter net sales were a record $561mm, an increase of $126mm or 29% from a year ago 
• 
The sales growth was driven by $84mm from new products, including strong sales in many of our Consumer 
Healthcare categories, which offset lower sales in API. 
• 
Adjusted consolidated gross profit was $158mm, up 21% from a year ago 
• 
Adjusted gross margin was 28.2% compared with 30% last year 
• 
Adjusted consolidated operating income was $65mm, up $15mm or 31% from last year 
• 
Adjusted operating margin reached 11.5%, up 20BPS from last year 
• 
Adjusted consolidated net income was $43mm compared with $34mm last year 
• 
Adjusted EPS were $0.46, up from $0.36 last year 

Business Segments 

Consumer Healthcare 

• 
Now on to the business segments, starting as always with Consumer Healthcare 
• 
Consumer Healthcare second quarter net sales increased $126mm or 39%, to an all-time record $446mm. $77mm 
or 24 percentage points of this improvement came from new products, led by the growth of Famotidine Complete 
and the continued strong sales of omeprazole and cetirizine 
• 
Our existing product portfolio also grew this quarter, as store brand penetration improved within smoking 
cessation and analgesic categories, and as our share of the nutrition store brand market increased 
Acquisition 

• 
Inorganic growth in the U.S. from our acquisition of JB Labs in September, and Unico in November, 
contributed 10 percentage points of the sales increase 
• 
Our acquisitions of Brunel and Galpharm in the U.K. and Diba in Mexico, contributed 6% of inorganic growth 
internationally 
• 
However, this top line growth is partially offset by unfavorable changes in the value of the British pound, 
and Mexican peso, vs. the U.S. dollar, in this quarter 
Gross Profit and Margin 

• 
Adjusted gross profit of $119mm was up $32mm from last year’s $87mm 
• 
Adjusted gross margin of 26.6% was down 40BPS from last year, driven by a combination of factors 
• 
While the adjusted gross margin benefited significantly from new products, and the implementation of new 
pricing activities in several existing categories, these gains were offset by a combination of higher production 
costs, and a product-mix effect of the Nutrition Product category 
• 
As we’ve noted in the past, the nutrition category has gross margins below the CHC average 
• 
As this category saw strong sales growth this quarter, adjusted gross margins had a positive volume impact, 
but a negative price impact to CHC overall 
Operating Expenses and Margin 

• 
Operating expenses in CHC increased $11mm from Q2 last year, due to both business growth and acquisitions 
• 
R&D spending increased $4mm, due mainly to the timing of clinical studies, as well as the inclusion of 
expenses from JB Labs and Galpharm 
• 
Distribution and SG&A dollar spend increased due to higher promotional activities and commissions, related 
to higher sales volumes this quarter, the inclusion of JB Labs and Galpharm, which added approximately 
$3mm in the quarter, and higher wages and IT investments in this quarter to support our rapid growth 
• 
As a percentage of sales, operating expenses decreased 180BPS to 13.1% from 14.9% last year, even with the 
inclusion of the acquisitions 
• 
In total, Consumer Healthcare had adjusted operating income for Q2 $60mm, up $21mm or 55% from last 
year 

• 
Adjusted operating margin in this segment was 13.5% of net sales, up 140BPS from last year 
Rx Pharmaceuticals 

• 
Looking next at Rx Pharmaceuticals 
• 
Second quarter net sales in Rx were $40mm, up $2mm or 5% compared with last year 
• 
This increase was due primarily to new product sales of approximately $6mm, along with a slight increase in 
sales volumes on our existing portfolio of products 
• 
These increases were partially offset by $2mm reduction in non-product revenue, along with continued pricing 
pressure, due to changes in customer mix, and increased competition in the marketplace for generic drugs 
Gross Profit, Margin, Operating Expenses 

• 
Gross profit was $16mm, down $2mm from last year 
• 
Gross margin was 38.8%, a decrease from 45.9% a year ago reflecting the decline in non-product revenues 
and the pricing pressures I just mentioned, as well as unfavorable changes in sales mix of products 
• 
Operating income was $7mm, down from $8mm last year on reduced gross profit contribution partially offset 
by $1mm reduction in operating expenses 
API 
Sales and Gross Profit 

• 
Next looking at API, where API net sales in Q2 were $32mm, down from $35mm last year due to lower sales 
volumes on two key products and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
• 
The gross profit was $10mm, down from $12mm a year ago on the lower sales volume of those two key 
products and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
Operating Expenses & Margin 

• 
Operating expenses were $9mm, up 5% from last year, due primarily to the recognition of $400,000 loss on 
assets that fund Israeli post-employment obligations 
• 
In Israel, as required by applicable law, we have a deposited fund managed by financial institutions designated 
by management that are intended to cover post-employment benefits for our Israeli employees 
• 
Israeli law generally require payments of benefits upon dismissal of an employee or upon termination in other 
certain circumstances 
• 
The dramatic decline in the financial markets during the second fiscal quarter reduced the value of our 
funded assets, necessitating a charge to operating expense at the end of the second fiscal quarter 
• 
Operating income in API was $1mm, down from $3mm last year due to the decrease in gross profit and the 
loss on assets that fund these Israeli post-employment obligations 
Consumer Products and Pharmaceutical Diagnostics 


• 
In the other category, which is our Israel-based Consumer Products and Pharmaceutical Diagnostics businesses, 
second quarter net sales were $43mm, up 2% or $800,000 from last year 
• 
The increase in net sales was driven primarily by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and an 
increase in existing product sales, partially offset by $2mm related to a change in the customer contract from 
product sales to a commission-based model 
Gross Profit and Operating Expenses & Income 

• 
Gross profit decreased $1mm or 6% due to increased pricing pressure 
• 
Additional unfavorable changes in sales mix and a slight increase in the cost of raw materials negatively 
impacted gross profit 
• 
Offsetting these decreases were favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
• 
Operating expenses were $13mm, up from $11mm last year due primarily to the recognition of $2mm loss 
on the assets that fund Israeli post-employment obligations as well as unfavorable changes in the foreign 
currency rate 
• 
Similar to API, the other category was unexpectedly hit by the effects of the decline in the market value of this 
post-employment fund 
• 
As a majority of our Israel-based personnel work within Consumer Products or Pharma Diagnostics, these two 
businesses were proportionally charged to the majority of this funds decline 
• 
It is worth noting that this is the first time that we have experienced such a dramatic impact on these assets 
• 
Operating income in the other category was $500,000, compared with $3mm last year 
Corporate Expenses 

• 
Now, a brief word about corporate expenses; adjusted unallocated corporate expenses for the quarter were $4mm, 
down from $5mm in Q2 last year 
• 
This decrease was due primarily to lower corporate administrative costs 
Six Month 2YTD Results 

Now, let’s continue with the recap of the six-month YTD results 

Consolidated net sales for the first six months of FY2009 of $1.042B, increased $223mm or 27% as compared to a year 
ago, with sales up in Consumer Healthcare and the other category 

Gross Profit, Net Income and EPS 

• 
Consolidated GAAP gross profit was $299mm, up 20% from $248mm in FY2008 
• 
Consolidated YTD GAAP net income was $63mm, down from last year’s $68mm 
• 
On a GAAP basis, EPS were $0.67 compared to $0.72 last year 
• 
In addition to the items affecting Q2 which we consider non-operating in nature that I noted earlier, we had a 
small charge in Q1 FY2009 of $600,000 or $0.01 per share, related to a loss on an asset exchange in the U.K 
• 
In total, the adjustments in H1 FY2009 were $18mm after-tax or $0.20 EPS 

• 
The reconciliation from the reported GAAP numbers to our adjusted non-GAAP numbers are available in Table 2 
of the appendix to the press release we just released earlier this morning 
• 
H1 FY2009 adjusted consolidated gross profit was $302mm, an increase of $54mm or 22% from last year 
• 
Adjusted consolidated gross profit margins decreased 130BPS to 29%, as compared to 30.3% a year ago 
• 
Adjusted consolidated operating income was $124mm, up 29% from $96mm last year, driven by strong results in 
the Consumer Healthcare segment 
• 
This translated into a consolidated adjusted operating margin of 11.9% of net sales, up 20BPS from the same 
period last year 
• 
Adjusted consolidated net income was $81mm, up from $68mm last year and adjusted EPS were $0.86 compared 
to $0.72 last year 
Operating Results 

Consumer Healthcare Segment 

• 
Now some brief highlights of the six-month operating results by segment starting with Consumer Healthcare 
Sales and Margin 

• 
YTD net sales for the Consumer Healthcare segment were $813mm, an increase of 38% or $224mm compared 
to FY2008 
• 
Included within these sales were $144mm of new product sales, led by omeprazole, cetirizine, famotidine 
and ranitidine, $38mm increase from higher domestic sales at existing products and $71mm from our 
acquisitions of JB Labs, Unico, Galpharm, Brunel and Diba 
• 
These increases in sales were partially offset by the absence of $16mm of sales from the divested vitamin, 
mineral and supplement business in the U.K., and unfavorable changes in the foreign currency exchange 
rate of $10mm 
• 
Leveraging the strong sales growth, Consumer Healthcare adjusted gross profit increased to $228mm, $69mm 
or 44% improvement from last year 
• 
The adjusted profit margin was 28.1% of sales, a 110 basis point improvement from FY2008 
• 
The improvement was driven by increased sales of new higher margin products and a positive pricing impact 
on a few key product categories 
• 
These were partially offset by a lower gross margin contribution from the growing nutrition product 
category 
Adjusted Operating Expenses 

• 
YTD adjusted operating expenses for FY2009 increased 20% or $18mm compared to FY2008 
• 
The increase was both inorganic and organic 
• 
Approximately half or $8mm of the increase related to operating expenses at our new JB Labs, Galpharm, 
Diba and Unico entities 

• 
The increase was comprised of an incremental $3mm for research and development spend on clinical studies, 
$3mm of incremental spend over last year on variable selling activities for new products, and incremental 
spending on IT projects to support our rapid growth 
• 
As a percentage of sales, FY2009, adjusted operating expenses decreased 200BPS compared to FY2008 
Rx Pharmaceutical 

Sales and Operating Expenses 

• 
YTD, Rx Pharmaceutical sales was $74mm, flat compared to the same period last year 
• 
New product sales of $11mm, and increased sales volumes, were partially offset by $6mm reduction in 
non-product revenue along with continued pricing pressure and increased competition for generic drugs 
• 
Rx operating expenses increased $600,000 for the period and 90BPS as a percent of sales 
• 
The increase was primarily related to recognizing $500,000 loss on assets that fund Israeli 
post-employment obligation, and increased research and development costs of $400,000 
• 
We continue to work on realigning expenses in our Rx business and for the first six months, we’ve reduced 
administrative expenses by $500,000 from last year 
API Segment 

Net Sales, Gross Profit and Operating Income 

• 
Net sales for the API segment were $66mm, a decrease of $7mm or 10% from last year 
• 
Gross profit was $19mm, down from $27mm a year ago, due primarily to lower sales of two key products; 
unabsorbed production cost on lower volume, and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
• 
API operating income was $2mm, down $9mm compared to $11mm last year 
• 
This was as a result of the lower gross profit along with the YTD loss of $500,000 on assets that fund the 
Israeli post-employment obligation 
• 
In the other category, net sales were $89mm, up $7mm or 8% compared to last year, due primarily to 
favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
• 
Gross profit of $29mm was down $600,000 compared to last year due to unfavorable product sales mix 
• 
Operating income for our other category decreased $4mm compared to last year, due to the decreased gross 
profit contribution as well as the $2mm loss on assets that fund Israeli post-employment obligation 
Corporate Expense and Tax Rate 

• 
Adjusted unallocated corporate expenses for the six months were $8mm compared to $6mm last year 
• 
The increase was due primarily to the absence this year of $2mm favorable settlement of a pre-acquisition 
legal claim related to Agis which was recorded in Q1 FY2008 
• 
The YTD effective tax rate for FY2009 was 30% compared with the actual rate of 23% for the same period in 
FY2008 

• 
Foreign source income before tax for the first six months of FY2009 was 19% of consolidated pre-tax earnings, 
down from 45% in the same period for FY2008 
• 
Foreign source income is generally derived from jurisdictions with the lower tax rate than the U.S. statutory rate, 
and as a result, the effective tax rate was higher than the comparable period last year 
• 
Also, I should note that in Q1 FY2008, we received a favorable tax ruling in Israel which resulted in a 
one-time tax benefit of $4mm, reducing last year’s rates by approximately 450BPS 
Balance Sheet Items 

Now let’s look at our balance sheet 

Working capital, excluding cash and current investments was $433mm at the end of the quarter, vs. $333mm last year, 
an increase of $100mm 

Accounts receivable were $359mm compared with $311mm a year ago, reflecting our higher FY2009 sales volume and 
$28mm related to the newly acquired businesses 

Inventories and Accounts Payable 

• 
Inventories were $431mm, up from $326mm at this time last year 
• 
The increase was driven primarily by the 38% top line growth of Consumer Healthcare over this time last year 
and the requirement to have more inventory on hand to service this high demand 
• 
We typically respond to increased demand by holding more raw materials to maximize flexibility in our supply 
chain 
• 
In addition, there were 28mm more dollars of inventory on our balance sheet at the end of the second fiscal 
quarter related to newly acquired businesses 
• 
Accounts payable were $266mm compared with $194mm a year ago, related to the aforementioned raw materials 
build in inventory and the $19mm related to the newly acquired businesses 
Cash from Operations 

• 
Cash provided by operations was $35mm in Q2 compared with $66mm last year 
• For the first six months of FY2009, cash provided by operations was $36mm compared to $93mm a year ago 
• 
The decrease in cash from operations was related primarily to $33mm of higher income tax payment in H1 this 
FY vs. last year; higher bonus payments in the first fiscal quarter of 2009 related to our strong performance of 
FY2008 vs. last year, and the higher use of cash in the procure-to-pay cycle, that is inventory and accounts 
payable due to the inventory build, I mentioned just a few moments ago 
• 
At the end of Q2, cash in current investment securities were $162mm, up $60mm from $102mm at the same time 
last year 
• 
As of the end of the quarter, we had an additional $200mm of untapped capacity on our existing bank revolver 
• 
Our total current and long-term debt on the face of the balance sheet is $909mm, but includes $400mm 
back-to-back loan which is completely offset by the $400mm restricted cash deposit in non-current assets 
• 
Net of the back-to-back loan, our external debt is $509mm 

Net Debt to Total Capital 

• 
As of December 27, our debt to total capital is 38.1% and our net debt to total capital was 26% 
• 
Net debt to total capital has increased from the end of FY2008, as we have put our cash to work through the 
purchases of JB Lab, Diba and Unico 
• However, with debt to total capital still below 40%, we are still within our target and in a sound position 
• 
With our current balance sheet, operating cash flow and access to additional liquidity, we believe that our capital 
structure remains strong 
Share Repurchasing, EPS and Dividends 

• 
We repurchased 1mm shares of our common stock for $32mm and 1.1mm shares for $31mm during Q2 FY2009 
and 2008 respectively 
• 
YTD, we repurchased 1.8mm shares of our common stock for $62mm and 1.3mm shares for $35mm in FY2009 
and 2008 respectively 
• 
While we still have our 10b5-1 plan in place, we have not been actively repurchasing in the market since 
November 
• 
It is our belief that building and maintaining a strong cash position in this volatile market is one of the best ways 
to ensure strategic flexibility and to drive shareholder value 
• 
And as such, we have suspended repurchasing stock at this time 
• 
We are continually reevaluating this decision as market events warrant 
• 
n H1 FY2009, we paid cash dividends of $10mm or $0.105 per share 
• 
Additionally, on January 28th, our Board of Directors approved another $0.055 quarterly dividend to 
shareholders of record on February 27, 2009 
Guidance 

With H1 behind us, and a challenging economic environment in front of us, we’ve spent considerable time evaluating 
both the risks and opportunities for H2 FY2009 

As you just heard, our API and other segments had a challenging Q2 the FY, as demand was much softer than 
expected, causing sales and gross profits to decline 

• 
On top of that, unexpected financial market changes in the fourth calendar quarter of 2008 caused large declines 
in our Israeli post-employment obligation fund, a force beyond any one organization’s control 
For API, our earlier guidance estimated that this business segment would grow between 7 and 10% from FY2008 
We are now expecting that we will not be able to make up the API sales shortfall from H1 

Sales and Gross Margins 

• 
H2 sales will improve from H1, and more closely resemble H2 FY2008 
• 
We now expect the full year gross margins in API to be in the low to mid-30s 

• 
Leveraging lower operating expense levels, operating margins are still expected to be in the low teens; but again 
on full year reduced sales volume 
• 
Consumer Healthcare had a strong H1 FY2009 with record sales 
• 
However, our adjusted gross margins were lower than we had expected, due mainly to some challenges in our 
– on our nutrition category 
New Pricing Strategies and Cost-Containment Initiatives 

• 
We achieved positive market share growth in nutrition at a time when material’s pricing was very high and our 
production capacity in that category was limited 
• 
These effects negatively impacted the overall CHC gross margins 
• 
We now expect to see the positive effects of new pricing strategies in H2, but also expect that gross margin in 
this product category will still be significantly below the CHC average through this year and as a result, will be a 
drain on the overall adjusted gross margin 
• 
We’ve implemented strict cost-containment initiatives already that can be seen in the additional leverage of 
SG&A as a percent of sales vs. last year, and we expect to continue to see the influence of these initiatives in H2 
Gross Margin, Revenue and Expenses 

• 
We now expect that our full year consumer healthcare business will grow by more than 18%, but that adjusted 
gross margins will decline 50 to 100BPS from the FY2008 adjusted level of 28.7% 
• 
We still expect consumer healthcare adjusted operating margins to expand from last year’s 13.5%, through better 
leverage and operating expenditures partially compensating for the change in gross margins 
• 
As you’ll recall, we stated in November that you could expect consolidated revenue growth between 13 and 18% 
for the full year 
• 
We’re confirming this growth rate 
• 
We also stated that we expected the consolidated adjusted gross margins to be stable to the full year adjusted 
FY2008 margin of 31.1% 
• 
Given Q2 challenges within API, the other category, the nutrition product category margin dynamics and our 
expectation for these areas in H2, we now estimate adjusted consolidated gross margin to be down 100 to 
200BPS from last year 
• 
We are still expecting to maintain our 4% consolidated R&D spending level as stated in November, in order to 
keep moving forward towards more new product launches in the future 
• 
Distribution, selling, general and administrative expenses were expected to be 14% of net sales and for H1 we 
were already below this level 
• 
With our additional cost-containment activities underway, we expect this ratio to decline another 50BPS to 
approximately 13.5% of sales for the full year 
Operating Income & Margin 

• 
We anticipated total operating income margin to be in the 12 to 14% range for the full year 

• 
Our adjusted operating margin was 11.9% in H1 FY2009, and with some operating margin improvements in H2 
in Rx, API and other, we are forecasting consolidated adjusted operating margin percent to remain in that 12 to 
14% range 
• 
Finally, we are continuing to use an effective full year tax rate of approximately 28% in developing our earnings 
guidance update 
• 
For all of these reasons, we are revising our full year FY2009 adjusted earnings guidance range to be between 
$1.75 and $1.90 per share, as compared to the $1.92 to $2 per share quoted in November 
Operating Cash Flow and CapEx 

• 
For the full year, we expect operating cash flow to be between 190 to $220mm, a reduction from the previous 
guidance of 210 to $240mm, as a result of the change in net income guidance 
• 
Full year CapEx is projected to be in the range of 65 to $70mm and will include expenditures at our newly 
acquired Michigan, Florida and Mexico facilities, as well as production-expansion projects underway in South 
Carolina and Allegan, Michigan

Highlights 

New Product and Store Brands 

• 
Now that Judy has given you all the details for H1 our year, I’d like to provide some additional information on 
the new product performance for a couple of our key launches and also some of the challenges and action plans 
we have for H2 FY 2009 
• 
First and foremost our new products we continue to invest in and launch new products 
• 
During Q2, we added a record $84mm in new product sales 
• 
Cetirizine, the store brand comparable to Zyrtec continues to perform well 
• 
Our data as of December 21st shows that cetirizine store brands have averaged in the mid-40s in market share 
• 
Significantly higher than the traditional 20 to 25% store brand cough and cold category in market share 
• 
Also, we have named our 80 plus percent market share of the store brand cetirizine market despite numerous 
competitors 
• 
Our store brand version of Omeprazole OTC has captured nearly 40% of the market as we projected to you over a 
year ago, we expect Omeprazole to add 150 to $200mm in annual sales and recent sales data show that we are on 
track to meet that goal 
• 
On December 29, we announced that we received final approval from the FDA for OTC Ibuprofen PM 
Shipment and Sales 

• 
We expect to begin product shipments to retailers in the next few weeks 
• 
The product is comparable to Wyeth’s Consumer Healthcare’s Advil PM tablets indicated as a pain reliever 
and nighttime sleep-aid 

• 
Our estimated brand sales for the product for the last 12 months ending December 21 were approximately 
$71mm 
• 
During Q1, we began shipping Famotidine Complete chewable tablets, the national brand equivalent to Pepcid 
Complete tablets to retailers 
• 
It is estimated that Pepcid Complete has the annual sales of approximately $100mm 
• 
Our launch is going well as we have 180 days of marketing exclusivity 
• 
However, we believe the exclusivity period will effectively last even longer as we are not aware of anyone 
else having filed an application for marketing approval of this product 
Smoking Cessation Category 

• 
In the smoking cessation category, we now have competition in the coated nicotine gum 
• 
At the end of December, Watson announced that it was coming to market with the coated nicotine gum product 
• 
They have been competing with us in the uncoated gum category for several years 
• 
We expected them to enter the coated gum product line during the CY. 
• 
So this was already in our original guidance 
Rx Business 

• 
In our Rx business, we acknowledged the settlement of patent litigation brought by Sanofi-Aventis against Barr 
Laboratories 
• 
They developed the Triamcinolone Acetonide Nasal Spray product with us and are awaiting final approval from 
the FDA 
• 
As a reminder, Nasacort had annual sales of approximately $325mm for the 12 months ended in November 2008 
• 
We are very focused on gaining final approval for this product which is an important driver for achieving our FY 
2009 Rx segment profitability 
Challenges 

Now, I’d like to read some of our challenges and action step for H2 FY 2009 but to be clear, our new products will 
continue to be an important growth driver for Perrigo 
Let me talk about some of the challenges 

Our API business has under performed 
Our vitamin and mineral nutritional supplement our VMS category has increased sales but was impacted by a 
constrained raw material supply and higher costs and clearly the volatile global economy has impacted our results 

API Business 

• 
Let me start with the API business 
• 
First as Judy mentioned, API bore the brunt of the changes in the global foreign currency fluctuations that we 
experienced 

• 
In addition, the weakening global economy has impacted demand for some of our products as customers delayed 
their orders to manage their costs and inventories 
• 
Here are some of the steps we’re taking to mitigate the negative impact of these factors to our API plan 
• 
We’re cutting our cost significantly in our API business and controlling our inventories and raw material supply 
• 
Second, we’re focusing on increasing sales with potential new product approvals that we’re working very hard 
to gain 
• 
Third, we’re implementing pricing strategies to offset some of the weakness that we’re experiencing in our 
API business 
VMS Business 

• 
And in the second area, our VMS business or Vitamin Nutritional Supplement business, our VMS business grew 
sale as a result of issues encountered at a competitors operations during late summer and in to the fall 
• 
We made a decision to proactively ramp up our operations to meet the customers need for high quality products 
• 
In doing so we acquired additional raw materials right when the supply was constrained and the cost registered 
all time highs 
• 
The sudden influx of demand in our short-term capacity constraint required us to additionally invest in short-term 
external production assistance in order to service the high volume 
• 
The steps we’re taking to meet the challenges in this area include: 
• 
Number one; we are qualifying additional raw material vendors to lower our costs 
• 
Number two; We are improving our facilities to add flexibility to our internal operations 
• 
As an example, we’ve qualified our JB Labs acquisition to give us more manufacturing flexibility in 
Vitamin and Mineral Supplement business 
• And finally, we are implementing some pricing strategy to reflect the commodity prices I discussed before 
• 
I’ve been very pleased with our VMS market share gains that have occurred in the past year and look forward to 
get this business back on track 
• 
This is a growing category, can be an important contributor for us in the future 
Volatile Global Economy 

• 
The third challenge this quarter is the volatile global economy 
• 
As Judy detailed earlier, Israel requires that all companies to maintain the post employment benefits fund 
• 
The depressed global stock market caused a loss on the asset which fund these post employment benefits 
• 
Also, wild swings in the foreign exchange rates added to our challenges during the quarter 
• 
In addition to the specific cost initiatives in Israel, we put in place strict costs containment programs around the 
world which we believe will offset some of our H1 challenges that I just mentioned 
Key Strategic Imperatives 

In summary, we’re expecting to grow our EPS by 11 to 20% vs. last year 


We’re going to focus on a couple of key strategic imperatives 

OTC and Prescription Rx Business 

• 
First, we will continue to strive to be first in the market in the OTC and prescription Rx business 
• 
We have exclusive offerings that we expect to generate more than $1mm of branded sales that we have the 
exclusivity on, that over the next year or may be longer 
• 
We are investing to keep the pipeline robust; we are continuing to make an investment in our R&D programs 
• 
We believe that more than $10B in branded prescription sales products will switch from prescription to 
over-the-counter in the next five years 
• 
And our goal, as it has been in the past, is to be first to market with those products 
API Business Segment 

• 
Second, to ensure the API business segment has a stronger H2 the year, my team is focused on increasing sales 
through new products, implementing a new pricing strategy and making the necessary expense adjustments to be 
back on track with their revised plan 
Vitamin Nutritional Business 

• 
Third, our operation has been able to meet the demand caused by our tremendous success in the over-the-counter 
and vitamin nutritional business 
• 
Our top line CHC growth trajectory has increased dramatically in the last two years and volumes to our plants 
have risen 30% during that period 
• 
During the period of extreme commodity price swings, our supply chain team will focus on continuing to manage 
the long-term impact of raw material pricing to the company 
• 
We have and continue to ramp up production efficiencies to continue to meet customer demands for quality 
affordable products 
• 
Certainly there will be challenges to this kind of growth as Judy talked about some of those early such as the 
examples of working capital, but throughout this rapid period of growth we’ve maintained our high quality 
standard and continue to invest in our quality processes 
• 
Longer-term, our OTC business is the clear leader in the category 
• 
We will have major new products in the verge of switching from Rx to OTC in our branded Rx to generic over 
the next few years 
Store Brand Proposition 

• 
Finally, in the challenging economy, we will continue working together with our customers to make consumers 
more aware of the store brand proposition 
• 
Unlike other categories of private label, OTC healthcare products and generic prescriptions drugs are FDA 
approved 
• 
The data is showing that consumers are making that value judgment as the store brand continues to grow share 

• 
Additionally, we believe the balance sheet is strong and positions Perrigo to stay at the course in the current 
market 
• 
Rising healthcare costs coupled with an ageing population makes Perrigo uniquely positioned to meet the world’s 
growing need for quality affordable healthcare products 
Q&A 

<Q - Daniel Rizzo>: I think you indicated and maybe you already talked about this, but that the consumer or customers 
are lowering their inventories or have lowered their inventories in Q2. Is that continuing right now? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: Yeah. Yes, Daniel, the answer to that is that in the over-the-counter area, customers, our 
customers, retailers have lowered their inventory and we do see that as we speak – sit here today. The approximate 
number is approximately 8% reduction in inventory in the retailers vs. the same time period one year ago. 

<Q - Daniel Rizzo>: Okay. And then, again, maybe you talked about this, but you said that there was additional cost 
related to capacity constraints because you had to outsource some production capacity. Is that right? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: That is correct. 

<Q - Daniel Rizzo>: Did you – do you know what products was that for? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: It was – we, as I mentioned in the script, we experienced tremendous growth in our vitamin, 
nutritional supplement business. 

<Q - Daniel Rizzo>: Right. 

<A - Joseph Papa>: As a result of the growth, because of some of the issues that occurred in a competitor, we took on 
demand that was significantly beyond our past vitamin, nutritional supplement business. As a result of that we needed 
some help with areas that are within the critical path of manufacturing those products, when we took on that help and 
obviously we had to pay for that. 

Now, while that certainly is something that affects the near term, we did feel that strategically it was in the best interest 
of our shareholders to take on that incremental investment, which is what I would call it today, knowing that the 
long-term gains in market share and the profitability from those products is warranted and that’s why we feel it was the 
right thing for us to do at this time. 

<Q - Daniel Rizzo>: Okay. But that’s still occurring to you still, I mean, do you still add capacity in at those products 
correct? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: No, we actually – because of some great activities by our team, we’ve been able to transition out 
of the external manufacturing into our facility at here, we have a facility in South Carolina as well as a facility that we 
recently acquired called JB Laboratory. The combination of the efforts in our South Carolina facility as well as JB 
Laboratory allowed us to take on the incremental demand required and allowed us to now – going forward from 
January, we no longer are seeking additional external support. There may be a couple of products still coming in from 
past orders but no additional product will go forward as a requirement for external manufacturing help. 

<Q - Daniel Rizzo>: Okay. All right, thank you. 

<A - Joseph Papa>: Thank you for your question. 

<A - Arthur Shannon>: Operator, by the way, we’re going to extend the call after 11.00 o’clock so we’ll have enough 
time for a few more questions. 

<Q - Linda Bolton-Weiser>: Thanks. Just on the vitamins, I mean, can you give us some sense of how much the 
vitamin and nutritional sales increased y-over-y in the quarter? 


<A - Joseph Papa>: Yeah, Linda, probably the best way I would say it is, we talked about our top line growth (48.33) 
of the CHC business being approximately 39% growth, the vitamin, nutritional supplement business grew faster than 
that. I don’t want to give specific numbers because we don’t talk about specific categories, but I can tell you the VMS 
business grew faster than our overall CHC business. 

<Q - Linda Bolton-Weiser>: That’s helpful, thanks. And just going forward in terms of how this – this impacts the 
mix of your business kind of on a permit because you’re adding in – certainly vitamins is lower margin than, say, a 
Zyrtec, I would expect, right? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: That is correct. 

<Q - Linda Bolton-Weiser>: But can you give us some sense of how vitamins compares to, say, aspirin and Ibuprofen 
profitability-wise? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: Well, I will – let me differentiate my comments, some for the quarter comments and then some 
going forward. For the quarter, the vitamin and mineral supplement business was obviously of a lower margin than 
some of the products you mentioned, like in Ibuprofen. Having said that, we believe that through efforts that we are 
taking on and those that I outlined in my script, certainly the issues that we’re taking on for alternate vendors of raw 
materials, additionally, the ability to move the manufacturing from external sources back internally; we think that is 
going to help us get those products to a higher gross margin than certainly they were in the quarter and back to the 
levels of products like in aspirin, like in Ibuprofen; not to the levels of a Cetirizine but certainly back to those type of 
levels. But that’s really what we are focused on. We have a laser focus on getting that profitability of our vitamin and 
mineral supplement business back to the levels of – that I referred to before. 

<Q - Linda Bolton-Weiser>: That’s helpful. Thanks. And then just a question on the – I mean, the currency FX. Do 
you have like an FX effect on just the sales growth in the quarter and then an effect on the bottom-line earnings growth. 
And also, I mean, maybe you could just clarify more because I’m confused, because you were manufacturing some API 
and Rx products in Israel which are being supplied somewhat in North America, so that’s – the shekel has devalued 
along with some of the other European currencies. So I’m confused about why this is a negative, wouldn’t this be a 
positive FX? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: Yeah, I’m going to let Judy address most of the question. Let me just make a couple of comments 
at the onset. I think first and foremost that we have in the past historically had a little bit of what I call a natural hedge. 
Some things have gone up, some things have gone down. I think what has changed in this particular quarter is the 
magnitude of some of the change that occurred and maybe, Judy, you want to talk a little bit about some of the 
magnitude of some of the changes to address Linda’s question. 

<A - Judy Brown>: Absolutely. Thanks, Joe. So there was a multiple part question there and we highlight normally 
every quarter what the impact of foreign currency is on the top line absolutely so that you can roll forward your 
expectations of growth, inorganic, organic as well as impacts like this from foreign currency. 

As Joe just said, we are, in normal environment, naturally hedged. So if you get down to the operating income line and 
the net effect of all of the ins and outs of our multiple currencies and the natural impact that happens when you produce 
and sell in the same currency, we normally net down close to zero. 

In second quarter in particular, because of the more than two standard deviation move on the pound and the Mexican 
peso and the continued movement in the Israeli shekel in that quarter, we did see some net effect drop through 
operating income. And on a high level, just to give you an order of magnitude, as I stated in my earlier comments, the 
effect of foreign currency on the top line on a consolidated basis vs. last year was still – it netted out – sorry, second 
quarter only vs. last year was about $9mm y-over-y. YTD though that netted out to almost zero, just in terms of on the 
full-year six-month impact. 

But if you look at the full year YTD over last year variance on operating income, there still was a net impact. While the 
natural hedge activity in the Israeli-only consumer products and pharma businesses and the Mexican and U.K. 
businesses basically netted themselves out vs. last year, there still is a net impact within API. And that is because the 


API business, while the vast majority of the production is happening in the Israeli shekel, they do transact their 
business in U.S. dollar, in the euro, in Japanese yen as well as shekel. So that is one where the flows were not able to be 
naturally hedged. 

We are obviously looking at our expectations going forward, particularly, how it’d affect that business and looking at 
ways to mitigate that. But in general, we do not have a complex hedging strategy for all of the global cash flows, again, 
because even with these standard deviation movements, most of the rest of the world does net down to zero. This was a 
very unusual quarter with the volatility in the market movements around the world. 

<Q - Linda Bolton-Weiser>: Okay, thanks. 

<A - Judy Brown>: Does that help somewhat? 

<Q - Linda Bolton-Weiser>: Yes. Yes. Thank you. 

<A - Judy Brown>: Sure. 

<Q - Derek Leckow>: Hello? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: Hi, Derek. 

<A - Judy Brown>: Good morning, Derek. 

<Q - Derek Leckow>: Hi. So your operating income in Q2 in your core business is up 45% and the other businesses 
are down 44% and your – so your total impact here, you talked a lot about this post-employment issue in the quarter 
and I guess you’re continuing that out to Q3 and Q4. Can you quantify that and separate that out for us so we can see 
what that impact was? 

<A - Judy Brown>: For the full YTD P&L impact of the Israeli post-employment benefits, the net impact for the 
Company in H1 was about $3mm. And just to give you a sense of what this is, just to put it in context, it’s similar in 
structure to the way a U.S. pension plan would be set up, it’s required by law. As employers we make contributions 
into the fund every pay period for our employees and those assets then are held by financial institutions at the behest 
and the control of the – ultimately, the employees; like an employee might make a decision about their 401(k) assets. 
And as those funds then drop dramatically in value, as you all saw with the stock market declines in the fourth calendar 
quarter, that required us by law to take a charge for the decrease in those assets. The $3mm is H1, that’s across those 
Israeli businesses. 

We can not predict what will happen in H2, so at this point we assume that that $3mm is a permanent charge to the 
P&L for the full year. If in fact the assets recover, we will be able to recover some of that loss. We would call that out 
obviously for the rest of the year. But right now, within our guidance for H2, we don’t have any better position than to 
assume that that loss as it stands right now will stand for the remainder of the year. 

<Q - Derek Leckow>: So do we then project that 3mm across the next two quarters as well 

Or 


<A - Judy Brown>: No. We do not project 


<Q - Derek Leckow>: Have you already captured it? 

<A - Judy Brown>: Right now, we do not project a further loss. We assume right now that that loss stands and we 
break even for H2. 

<Q - Derek Leckow>: Okay. I see. 

<A - Judy Brown>: We have baked into our own numbers in the normal run rate, in operating expenses that you 
would have in your SG&A as a percent to sales ratio. We already put the normal contributions that we make for our 
employees just as a part of normal payroll costs. 


<A - Joseph Papa>: That’s exactly right. I think the only thing I’d add to what Judy says is as we look at any forecast 
for the remainder of a year, it’s always looking at some things that are going to be some of the positives, some things 
that are going to be the negatives. I think, as Judy said, we at this point think – we just look at this as being an expense 
that occurred and one that’s going to stay as such and we’ll continue to look towards the pluses and minus for the rest 
of the year. 

<Q - Derek Leckow>: So does comparable profitability for H2 then look more flattish compared to last year? Is that 
fair to say for those businesses? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: You’re asking for – well, obviously, the CHC profitability is really going to be factored by the 
sales growth. The sales growth numbers are significant with what we’ve been able to grow, both from the acquisitions 
as well as what we’ve been able to grow from the new product introduction. So, we’re clearly going to see top line 
revenue growth and as we projected for the full year, we’re expecting top line revenue growth being that 13 to 18% 
range and the EPS in the 11 to 20% EPS growth vs. the rest of the year. 

<Q - Derek Leckow>: I’m sorry, I was just talking about – sorry, Joe, I was just talking about profitability in the other 
businesses besides your Consumer Healthcare business. Would those return to a normal level of profitability in H2 or 
are we still expecting some erosion there? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: All right, I misunderstood your question. Judy? 

<A - Judy Brown>: Sure. And later when you reference back to the formal finance comments, tried to line that out for 
you. For API for the full year, we’re expecting H2 sales in API top line to resemble last year’s H2. 

<Q - Derek Leckow>: Okay. 

<A - Judy Brown>: So, for the full year, we’re expecting API top line to be flattish to last year in total. So we will not 
fully compensate for the GAAP in H1 but we’ll get to a better run rate in H2. And we also expect that the profitability 
in H2 will improve overall with cost containment activities and timing of some of the new products that Joe referenced 
in his comments. 

So, H2 the year, definitely expected to be driving more value through operating income dollars in H2. In the other 
business, our top line remains fairly consistent with this H1 the year run-rate and overall, gross margins there also 
looking to improve a basis point or two y-over-y. So, similar to the earlier guidance we gave in that business unit. 

<Q - Derek Leckow>: Okay. And then just shifting over now to the CHC business, in the vitamin/nutritional category, 
this momentum here, where you’re talking about faster than 40% growth, I guess that’s going to carry through, and 
that’s why – just make sure I understood this correctly – that’s why the 50 to 100 basis point decline in CHC you said 
gross margin, that’s going to about – between 100 and 200 now vs. prior expectations, and that’s because – it’s all 
because of that vitamin business, correct? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: It clearly is a product mix issue but also the issue simply is how we are approaching the 
improvement in the vitamin/mineral supplement business. So, it’s really a couple of factors that are really driving 
Judy’s comments. 

<A - Judy Brown>: And just to clarify so – and you can see this as you go through the prepared comments also, what 
we’re expecting in Consumer Healthcare is that the adjusted gross margins will decline 50 to 100BPS from last year. 
And we had originally thought that for the full year that the Consumer Healthcare gross margins would stay flat, so that 
new products would be offset by certain things but that we would stay flat y-over-y and now we’re talking about a 50 to 
100 basis point decline y-over-y. 

The 100 to 200 basis point decline that you just referenced in change to adjusted gross margin is specific to the 
consolidated company. And that, just wrapping it up again, is the impact both of the change I just mentioned in 
Consumer Healthcare coupled with the expectations for the contributions of the API business in the remainder of the 
year. So I just want to keep those two numbers – guidance ranges separate. 


<Q - Derek Leckow>: Yes. Thank you for clarifying. 

<A - Judy Brown>: 50 to 100 change. 

<Q - Derek Leckow>: In CHC. 

<A - Judy Brown>: In CHC fund and all of that translates rolled up into a 100 to 200 basis point change for the 
consolidated company vs. being flat y-over-y. 

<Q - Derek Leckow>: Okay. Thanks for clarifying that, Judy. Appreciate it. 

<A - Judy Brown>: Certainly. 

<A - Judy Brown>: Good morning, Greg. 

<Q - Gregory Gilbert>: Quick ones. Does the $15mm in base business growth exclude nutritionals or can you talk 
about that definitionally, Judy, as to what’s in that and what’s not in that? 

<A - Judy Brown>: Sure. Maybe the easiest way to just conceptually roll forward Consumer Healthcare growth if I 
break it down with a little more granularity than I did in the prepared comments, and I’ll focus on YTD and we can 
break out Q2 if you’d like as well. In total, Consumer Healthcare grew 38%. As I commented earlier, new products 
were 23% of that growth. We did some acquisition; in total, international and domestic about 12% of that growth. So 
you’d say, Judy, we’re at 35%, what else is going on? We’d also divested some business. We divested U.K. VMS 
business, as outlined in some more detail in the 10-Q which is going to be filed. 

We exited some product categories in the domestic CHC business, as we talk about always streamlining skews. And we 
also had some FX impact within CHC because of the U.K. and Mexico. Those three items were 8%, negative 3% from 
divestitures, negative 3% from exits, and negative 2% from FX, which gets us to 27%. 

The volume and base business expansion YTD in Consumer Healthcare then is 9% growth. So even excluding the new 
products and excluding the effect of acquisitions and divestitures, the base business of Consumer Healthcare was 9% 
growth. 

A similar roll-forward for Q2 where we saw 8% base growth, excluding the effect of divestitures, FX and exits. 

<Q - Gregory Gilbert>: Okay, thanks for that. On Rx, what drove the sequential bump in sales, given that scripts were 
relatively flattish from Q1 to Q2? And are there any other launches that you expect for the FY for Rx? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: Yes, Greg, good question. In the business for our Rx generic business, what has happened is one 
of the synergies that we have seen within Perrigo is the concept of ORx, and that stands for prescription products – I 
should say, let me say it a little differently, over-the-counter products that are still dispensed by our pharmacists; it’s an 
ORx business that happened with this business. 

We have capitalized on that as a separate opportunity within our business led by the generic Rx team and they have 
found new markets essentially for our products and they have capitalized on that and launched those products. That has 
been the biggest driver for us in that new product side, with the obviously other new products such as the generic of 
Olux but other than that the ORx has really driven that business. 

<Q - Gregory Gilbert>: And launches the rest of the year there in Rx? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: Yes, we do still expect some launches for the remaining portion of the year. There’s obviously, as 
in all of our new product launches, there’s some that are going to be a – we weigh the probability factor on any new 
products as to what will happen so that there are clearly though new product launches that we are expecting for the 
remaining part of the year. The other part of this that is very favorable to us, though obviously we’ve talked about is 
Triamcinolone, there’s opportunity in the air (1.04.32) to monetize that, and that will also be an important driver for the 
remaining portion of the year. 


<Q - Gregory Gilbert>: And lastly, Joe, it sounds like you have some near-term action plans for the API and other 
segments, but can you talk about to what extent those segments are core to Perrigo and whether you’re exploring 
options for either or both? Thanks. 

<A - Joseph Papa>: Let me start with API. API business still at this point we believe is a core business for us. It 
allows us to do the vertical integration. It also allows us to be smarter about our procurement of active ingredients 
across both the Rx business as well as Consumer Healthcare business. 

So, API business we still are very favorable towards. I will say that with the other business, the Israeli business, what 
we have said in the past and which we will continue to say is that we base all of our acquisitions and divestments on an 
ROIC model, return of invested capital, and we will continue to look at that. 

There is value in our consumer products Israel business as an example because it helps us to introduce store brand 
cosmetics into the United States. Having said that, we can look at multiple ways to do that and we will continue to 
assess our strategic alternatives with the Israeli consumer products business as we go forward. 

<Q - Gregory Gilbert>: Thank you. 

<Q - Randall Stanicky>: Couple of questions. Just a follow up on the generic question, what percent of – I guess both 
your pipeline and your current portfolio of products is vertically integrated to with your API product? 
<A - Joseph Papa>: I would say that currently it’s in the single-digits as a percentage as we go forward though, we 


will look to expand beyond single-digits and that’s both on the generic ORx as well as our Consumer Healthcare 
products. So, single-digits today is the best answer. 
<Q - Randall Stanicky>: So the vast majority are sold to third parties? 


<A - Joseph Papa>: Absolutely. 
<Q - Randall Stanicky>: Okay. Is there any contribution for Nasacort for the settlement that you have factored in to 
your back half outlook? 


<A - Joseph Papa>: Yes. 
<Q - Randall Stanicky>: Would you will be willing to quantify it? 
<A - Joseph Papa>: We don’t give out individual product deal details. But there clearly is a amount that we have 


acknowledged. So, for example in the 10-Q you’ll see a number at $2.5mm in Q2. 
<Q - Randall Stanicky>: Is that linked to approval? 
<A - Joseph Papa>: No, that was in the second part of that, which I refer to this time. 
<Q - Randall Stanicky>: Okay, but there is contribution factored in to the back fiscal half? 
<A - Joseph Papa>: That is correct. 
<Q - Randall Stanicky>: Okay. And then did you give us an FX impact for your consumer business for the top line? 
<A - Judy Brown>: For the top line? I did, I commented on that in the script. I believe that the impact y-over-y FX 


was approximately $10mm. 
<Q - Randall Stanicky>: And that’s just in the consumer business at 10mm? 
<A - Judy Brown>: That’s in Consumer Healthcare. Yeah. 
<Q - Randall Stanicky>: Okay. And then I may have missed this, but just in terms of widening the EPS range, can you 


help us understand what the bigger swing factors are? 



<A - Joseph Papa>: Yeah, I, Randall, this is Joe. The issue and the widening of the guidance is really reflecting the 
global economy that we’re in and some of the ups and downs and positives and negatives that we’re trying to assess 
with the total market that we competed. 

I mean if you look for example at the API business, we haven’t lost any customers having said that, the customers have 
pulled in their orders or reduced their orders. There is just more volatility in the markets than we have seen in the past. 
As a result of that, as we looked at all the positives all the negatives in our forecast, we just felt that a wider expansion 
of the range was warranted at this time. 

We clearly still feel very strongly about everything we’re doing in the Consumer Healthcare side, the new product side, 
what we’ve done in vitamin-mineral supplements. So, there is still a lot that’s positive, but we just felt the economy 
was one that warranted an expansion in our range at this time. 

<Q - Randall Stanicky>: And the pressure or the economic pressure, are you seeing this primarily through unit 
pressure or is it more on the pricing side as you think about selling to your customer base? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: Yeah, I think really – I have to segment my answer on that. In the API side, in the generic Rx 
side, I think there is some unit issue questions relative to how much customers are ordering. I think if you look at the 
overall Rx market, you’re seeing some declines in Rx. We can – declines in the growth rates of expected growth rate I 
should say that way, a little differently. Having said that; we think that the inventories have been reduced in API 
significantly. That on a go-forward basis, we will see the numbers that Judy talked about for the full year API. 

On the Consumer Healthcare side, candidly, we are seeing the situation actually accelerating the utilization of store 
brands. So, in fact, it’s a favorable factor for us on store brands where people are more and more as they go to the shelf, 
they are looking at, here’s the national brand, here is the store brand. We are seeing acceleration in utilization of store 
brands. 

So, really, what we try to do in looking at any forecasters, try to weigh the positives and negatives and just, I guess, I 
would call it the volatility of the total forecasts and that was really why we got this wider range and why we see some 
different factors and different weightings on some of the things that we see in API vs. some of the things we are seeing 
in our core Consumer Healthcare store brand business. 

<Q - Randall Stanicky>: You talked historically or recently about seeing pricing stabilize or even improve in 
consumer. Is that still the case? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: That is true. That is the case. I think historically the way I would say it is that our Consumer 
Healthcare business had declined in pricing in the 1 to 2% per range. Now I think it’s fair to say that we’ve stabilized 
that pricing decline and in fact, we have slight upturn in some of our pricing in Consumer Healthcare. And I think 
that’s something that we expect is going to continue to stay. 

<Q - Randall Stanicky>: Okay, I’ll stop there. Thank you, guys. 

<Q - Scott Hirsch>: Hi there. A quick question regarding the new products. Can you guys give us – I know you guys 
indicated, but are acquisitions are the three new tuck-in acquisitions, are they factored into the guidance range now? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: The acquisitions are factored in but not within our new products, if that’s what you’re asking me. 

<Q - Scott Hirsch>: So, they are not part of new products? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: They are not part of new products as we define new products. 

<Q - Scott Hirsch>: Okay. But they are now included in your annual expectations, I know previously they might not 
have been. 

<A - Judy Brown>: Yes. 

<A - Joseph Papa>: Yeah, the answer to that question is yes, Judy? 


<A - Judy Brown>: So. If you want to just think very high level of about our top line guidance, when we came out in 
November, our original guidance said that we would grow as a consolidated company 13 to 18% top line. We are 
confirming that guidance and that includes our acquisitions. So excluding our acquisitions, we are still looking at a 
strong 10 to 11% top line growth and so you say to me, why are you confirming your guidance range of 13 to 18%? 

We have acquisitions compensating in our global portfolio for some of the sales weakness Joe just talked about in some 
detail, with regards to particularly the API and the other businesses y-over-y. So, as we look at our full back – at our 
full guidance for the year, we can confirm that top line range with the inclusions now of those acquisitions. 

<Q - Scott Hirsch>: And just following up on that, and I might be wrong on this, but I believe you said that JB Labs 
can do roughly 70 and Unico annualized numbers of 50 and Laboratorios Diba’s are 15. Are they in for second quarter? 
Are they in just for H2 this year? How much do they impact this year, getting a sense of how much they could 
annualize for next year? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: Go ahead, Judy. 

<A - Judy Brown>: You can assume that all of the acquisitions are in for H2. We talked about those annualized rates. 
JB Labs was fully reflected in the second fiscal quarter. Unico was just basically December, so you only have about a 
month. Diba, you pick up about a month. Galpharm was fully in for H1, and Brunel was fully in for H1. So, in order for 
you to do your math, you can use that as a guideline to start annualizing our numbers. 

<Q - Scott Hirsch>: Okay. And then, just lastly, what are you thoughts on – was Nicorette a very high gross margin 
product for you and are your thoughts that Watson coming in here, will be a big impact. You have done really good on 
competing with cetirizine, do you think you can do the same with Nicorette? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: Yes. First question was nicotine is a good product for us – nicotine coated gum to be clear. So, it 
is a good product for us, has good gross margins. So, our expectation is that we can compete with this. We expected 
Watson in. As I mentioned, we have the progress in place that will allow us to continue to have a good strong coated 
nicotine gum franchise and our expectation is that we will be able do that. Clearly, Watson will gain share but we 
expect to still hold a majority position in share with a good gross margin product. 

<Q - Scott Hirsch>: Okay. 

<A - Joseph Papa>: I am sorry. Go ahead. 

<Q - Scott Hirsch>: And just lastly, what was some of the motivation around settling both the NASACORT and 
Clarinex in the outer years. Or is this just a function of what was the best decision at the time or was there other factors 
involved? 

<A - Joseph Papa>: Yes, I think both of this, two separate diverse patterns of facts here. I mean on the Nasacort that 
was a partnership product. We brought certainty to it, we brought some monetization to it in the near term. We felt it 
was – working with our partner, Barr, was good for. For Barr it was good, for Perrigo it was good for just going 
forward in terms of reducing uncertainty. 

On the Clarinex opportunity, that potentially is a crowded market depending on whether or not it gives, stays Rx or 
whether it goes over-the-counter. We saw the clarity of this direction, reducing our expenses, having clear decision. If it 
goes over-the-counter, we will have an opportunity to enter the market earlier and we will be well positioned if it stays 
in the Rx side. We’ve minimized the expense for that particular issue to fight that legal case and we find ourselves in a 
good position. 

So, I think different fact patterns but just certainly in both cases a chance to do the best things for the Perrigo 
shareholders. 

Operator, I think I have time for just one last question. I know we’ve gone over but we know there has been a lot of 
questions and we wanted to try to give you as much detailed information as possible. But operator, is there any more 
questions? 


<Q - Louise Chen>: Hi, just a few quick questions. Firstly on the raw material pricing. I guess in general it seems like 
raw material pricing is coming down. So, can you explain a little bit more why the vitamin business, the raw material 
cost was high and how long is it going to take to flow through in terms of the inventory? 

And, secondly just on your end markets, it looks like those are definitely still intact. You get very strong on the 
consumer business, and can you talk a little bit about your relationship with Medco and then also, just what retailers are 
doing to promote store brands since you said that the store brand is being increasingly favored by consumers. 

<A - Joseph Papa>: Okay, three good questions. First, Louise, on the Vitamin/Mineral Supplements – the raw 
materials that we acquired go back to some of the issues that from a sourcing point of view that occurred during the 
time period of the late summer, so August-September, somewhat associated with the Olympics. 

Second issue is that I think you may have seen in newspaper, there is some vitamin C pricing, I don’t know if I want to 
call it collusion, but there is certainly some activities that have occurred in vitamin C pricing that are causing some 
difficulties. I think that has sorted itself out and ultimately, because we’ve been able to go to alternate vendors of 
vitamin C, we do believe that we can get the vitamin C price of the raw materials under control and back to what I 
would call a more normal pricing environment for product such as vitamin C. 

On the second question on, so I think that just really reflects what happened. It will work through our system. We will 
get additional vendors on board, but it just takes some time and that’s the activities that I outlined in our action plan. 

On the question of Medco, we have very good relations with Medco predominantly in the generic Rx area but we have 
had discussions with Medco on a variety of different issues but good strong relationships with Medco and once again 
primarily on generic Rx area. 

Finally, the question on the retailer side; the retailer is looking to store brands as being an important driver for their 
growth in profitability. They have put additional promotional programs together. I think one of the best ones, the most 
visible one has been the Wal-Mart $4 program where they have taken $4 approach to their over-the-counter products 
and bundled that with other products to try to continue to increase the store brand utilization. 

But I think it goes beyond Wal-Mart and clearly the other retailers are doing similar program to drive utilization of 
store brand because it’s clearly good for the consumer, the ultimate end consumer, it’s good for the retailer and 
obviously it’s good for Perrigo. That really concludes, I think, your question, Louise 

Joseph C. Papa 

Outlook 

But basically as I look at it, I think we had a good quarter with record sales. We are still projecting top line growth of 
13 to 18% for the year. We are still projecting growth in our EPS of 11 to 20% EPS share. And importantly, in a 
volatile economic environment, I think we’ve taken a lot of steps to ensure for the long-term period of the shareholders 
that we’re doing the right things. 

We clearly are working on making the business better off by looking at our cost structures. Number two, we are clearly 
continuing our investment in research and development which we think is very important for the long-term success of 
our business. 

Number three, we’re clearly taking market share especially in our Consumer Healthcare core business and the 
Vitamin/Nutritional Supplements, which I mentioned, which we think is also very important over the long term. 

And fourth, we are continuing, as evidenced by the three acquisitions that have occurred in the last four months, going 
after acquisitions to continue to acquire related businesses that will help us to grow our total Consumer Healthcare 
franchise and we think that’s the good part of what makes Perrigo uniquely positioned to take advantage of the 
opportunities we find ourselves in the future
