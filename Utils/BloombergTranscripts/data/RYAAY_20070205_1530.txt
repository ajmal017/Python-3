MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION 
Operator 
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Ryanair's Third Quarter Results 2007 Conference Call. 
[Operator Instructions]. And just to remind you all, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand over to 
our Chairperson, Michael O'Leary, please begin your meeting and I will be standing by. 
Michael O'Leary, Chief Executive and Director 
Okay, thank you very much. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Sorry for the slight delay in getting started, but 
some people are having desperately [ph] getting through to the conference organized, so we would always wait a 
couple of minutes just to make sure we have everybody on. Very good set of Q3 results this morning, they have been 
on the Ryanair website since 7 O'clock, so we will pretty much assume that they have all been raised and everybody 
has a copy of them. 
Couple of themes to highlight, schedule revenues are up 28%, thanks to continuing strong traffic growth even during 
the third quarter, traffic was up 9%, yields have risen by 7%, significantly better than we expected for the quarter. 
Underlying yields are up slightly, but most of that increase is due to the baggage revenues. Ancillary revenues have 
grown strongly by 61%, those include a one-offsettlement rising from an early contract termination by the hotel 
partner. But again, the underlying ancillary revenues have risen by more, at a faster rate than scheduled traffic as has 
previously been the case. The good news, despite the fact that we are paying our largely [ph] hedged at $73 a barrel for 
fuel in the third and fourth quarter of this year, we have taken advantage of the recent weakness to go out and do a lot 
of fuel hedging for fiscal year-end March 2008. As we've announced this morning, we are 90% hedged for the key 
winter quarter at $65 a barrel, we are 50% hedged for the first half of the year. That is the two summer quarters at $61 a 
barrel. Overall, that means with about 70% of our fuel requirement hedged through fiscal '08, less 10%, guaranteed cost 
reduction of just over 10% on what we have paid this year. That means, we have already locked in at those rates; that's 
saving you approximately €60 million for the coming fiscal year. And if we can close out the remainder of the first half 
at or below or something close to current rate, obviously that saving will increase. 
The new bases in our book are performing well, Marseilles and Madrid are up and running and booking strongly. 
Bremen which starts on the 1st of March, good advance bookings, not quite as strong as Marseilles and Madrid, but a 
little bit stronger than we had originally expected. We expect to announce one new, fourth base for this summer some 
time in the next, obviously we said in the statement before the end of February, and that will be another base on the 
Continental Europe. 
I had couple of issues, we did want to touch on briefly, in hysteria in the UK about the contribution of aviation and 
airlines low-fare and in particular to global warming, much of it based on completely idiotic nonsense. And we've 
countered that continuously with the fact that this stern report confirms that aviation accounts for 1.6% of greenhouse 
gas emissions within the EU, the European Environmental Agency confirmed the airlines account for less than 2% of 
the EU's manmade CO2 emissions. Marine transport, by the way, accounts for almost double aviation, yet there has 
been no focus on ships or ferries. It seems to be a bit misleading in our view. We don't think it's going to have any

impact on the continuing growth of Ryanair, primarily because the fair difference between us and all of our competitors 
is so great. 
We welcome the OFT's recent decision to refer to BAA airport's monopoly to the Competition Commission. We hope 
and trust that the Competition Commission will, following a review, call for the break-up of the BAA monopoly. We 
remain, as are all of the other Stansted airlines, vigorously opposed to the plans of the BAA monopoly at Stansted to 
waste almost 4 billion pound sterling building a second runway, a second terminal and associated railway and 
motorway connections to Stansted. And I think this is a scam that is perpetrated on the traveling public by a) a 
regulated monopoly where you have been incompetent in the being [ph] regulator in the Civil Aviation Authority and 
the monopoly, an over-charged monopoly that the BAA determines to over-specify, over-build these abilities and 
therefore over-charge passengers for the next 20 years. 
Ryanair is fully behind the airport, Stansted airport airline association which has called for the construction of a 
lower-cost runway and terminal building. We believe it can and should be built for about n1 billion instead of 4 billion 
the BAA are presently proposing and we are continuing to campaign strongly for that. Similar situation in Dublin 
where the airport's monopoly following the same, broken, but not regulated monopoly as there is in the UK is now 
proposing to spend €750 million building a second terminal where 12 months ago, they were opposing spending about 
180 million. There is absolutely no requirement for that kind of waste. We don't need a five-story terminal building, we 
need a one or two story terminal building, and the fact that we and others have offered to build that terminal of similar 
size or less than €200 million is I believe a plan which should be accepted. 
As you will know, in November, we increased our stake in Aer Lingus just over 25%. And we are working actively 
with the European Commission over going to a Phase II review of that proposed offer. And we are hopeful and 
confident that at the end of that process which would be sometime around the middle of May, that Ryanair will receive 
EU competition approval to proceed with an offer for Aer Lingus. We have indicated to do the takeover plan and 
learned [ph] it would be our intention to make another offer for Aer Lingus at that time, appropriately for us to 
receiving or being allowed of receiving the commission of the takeover plan to make another offer within 12 months, 
the last offer at that time. 
In the current fourth quarter, we are continuing to rollout significant capacity expansion. We expect that half-year 
volumes will rise by about 25%, obviously on the back of our hedges, fuel costs will remain high. And but we do 
expect a slightly better outcome in the fourth quarter than previously predicted. As a result, we are pleased to say today 
that we have raised significantly our annual guidance, we now believe that profit after tax will rise 29% to about 390 
million for the full year, and we do that with a fair degree of visibility into the fourth quarter. One final shop keeping 
issue, we recently received shareholder approval to complete a 2-for-1 stock split, we are trying to implement this split 
on the 26th of February 2007, and we believe that our stock split will improve the marketability and liquidity of our 
share. 
I should say one point that's been raised before we get to the questions. One point that's been raised by a number of 
people this morning in our briefings is why were the analysts' forecasts so comparative [ph] this time around. I think it 
should be stressed in defense of some analysts, many of the analysts who already like Davy's, Goodbody's who are 
either advisors or a stockbroker to Ryanair or Aer Lingus are prevented under the competition rules from issuing any 
research on the -- in the current or in the present period while there is a possibility of an offer for Aer Lingus and we 
continue to be technically in an offer period for Aer Lingus. That does mean that unfortunately a lot of the research, 
some of the research, a lot of research that's out in the market isn't particularly accurate. There are some spectacularly 
inaccurate research out there, one or two who should have remained for Aer Lingus [ph] who have sell 
recommendations on the company and ludicrous price target on around 7 and €8. All I can do is apologize for that and 
say that some of the research would just be ignored, and but I am afraid that there won't be a very good flow of 
balanced research from analysts either close to or associated with Ryanair until the Aer Lingus thing is out of the way. 
So, apologies if anybody was misled by some of the research out there, and I am afraid there isn't anything we can do 
about it. Having said that, Howard, is there anything you want to add?

I think you pretty much covered it there. I mean, I think we would highlight the continued strength of the business. In 
particular, the cash position which is poised to be at Aer Lingus of just above €321 million. 
Michael O'Leary, Chief Executive and Director 
Okay, okay Carey [ph]. That's the end of the introductory remarks, you can open it up for questions and answers. 
Q&A 
Operator 
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from of line of Chris Reed [ph] from Deustche Bank. Please go ahead, 
sir, your line is open. 
<Q>: Hi guys, this is Chris Reed [ph] here from Deutsche. 
<A>: Hey Chris. 
<Q>: I've got two questions for you. Can you say a little bit about what you think these, looking at in detail and in 
particular routes that might be questioned, and how you see the outlook going on that? And then the other one is in 
terms of special dividend, is that on the backburner for the time being or and has the board actually discussed the 
possibility of doing that? Thanks. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Thanks Chris. The EEU discussions, as I am sure you would appreciate, are confidential, but 
I think it's safe to say that the main focus of the EEU review is the combined size of kind of a joint Aer Lingus-Ryanair 
operation at Dublin, and that's the focus of their concern. And whether, I think the combined operation between Aer 
Lingus and Ryanair in terms of flight [ph] would have about 60, between 65 and 70% of flight [ph] where generally, 
we are pushing strongly that that's quite similar to the position of the Air France at Paris, it's similar to the Star Alliance 
for example at Copenhagen and places like Munich. But I think it's basically just the focus, and to the extent there will 
be remedies, they are looking at the possibility of a joint operation handing over some of the, where there is no scarcity 
of flights [ph] at Dublin airport, but offering up some of the flights [ph], that with those joint operations would control 
the Dublin airport. 
In terms of special dividends, no it's very much on the front-burner. As we've guided and the discussion in the board 
has been along the line, we believe we need to maintain currently for the moment a minimum cash balance of about €2 
billion. I expect by the end of this year that that figure would have risen to, by the end of calendar 2007 somewhere 2.3, 
just over €2.3 billion and we are looking in closing at the overall between say around €300 million for a month of 
distribution. We had a discussion at board level, we are looking at the pros and cons of either a once-off dividend or a 
share buyback program. We are still looking at those. We are I think, or I would certainly personally be more in favor 
of a share buyback program, only because I think it has better long-term benefit for the remaining shareholders whereas 
the dividend program even though it would be a significant beneficiary, the dividend program strikes me as if it's just 
money wasted. But we won't finalize our kind of, I think the board won't finalize its cost on that until we get to the 
middle of the year or the full year results. 
<Q>: Okay. Thanks very much. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Thanks Chris.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Gill from Goodbody in Dublin. Please go ahead. Your line is 
open. 
<Q - Joe Gill>: Hi, good afternoon. And four questions here. First off, I wonder could you comment a little bit on yield 
given that you've had a sequence of quarters where you have had strong year-on-year positive yields driven by the 
environment in baggage charges. And if you extrapolate on a linear basis, you can get 30 punchy numbers as of March 
'08 based on your hedge in place at this stage. Could you talk a little bit maybe about the environment and what you 
think about how yields might evolve over the next year or two and so on? And maybe related to that, at Dublin, you 
have increased your seat capacity or your seat volume by over 300% in 18 months in terms of the fleet. Yet the market 
share has only grown by about utmost 30%. So, what sort of implications does that hold in terms of how yields may 
evolve in and out of Ireland over the next year or so? And third question, gambling, it's very early days I know in terms 
of the initiatives, any signs of what's happening there? And secondly, in terms of the mobile licensing application, how 
is that going and do you think it will be generation revenues for the business in the second half of the year? And the last 
point is just on Marseille, you mentioned the base opening there; the religious [ph] labor issue with the French 
government challenging you – how are you working around that for now and is this posing any obstacles to developing 
Marseille? Thanks. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Okay, thanks Joe. I think in terms of the yields, we gave the fact – the kind of seeing we were 
pushing with people in the half year results and that is – there is a degree of capacity stability in Europe over the last 12 
months that seems to be continuing in the next 12 months. That's given a lot of newer flag carriers the degree of pricing 
power that they haven't had for many years- you have seen extraordinary fuel surcharges being slapped on to take it 
both long haul and short haul, and what's been remarkable is the – although passed on to pricing is the extent to which 
in recent months as oil prices have comeback from highs of $78 back down to low 50, very few of them have been 
offering to give back any of the fuel surcharges, – excluding stuff [ph] and that is Aer Lingus' who are forcing to reduce 
the fuel surcharge of n40 on the peak of around a fuel cost of, cost of fuel with $55 a barrel. 
Now fuel is back to low $55 a barrels, and yet there is no sign of Aer Lingus either taking away that fuel surcharge or 
even reducing it. And we think that will continue to be the case although we have been more skeptical of looking out 
into FY '08, our guidance will be for flat yields over the coming year. I think there will be some pressure on the 
European Airlines to give back some of the fuel surcharges. We can't say framing [ph] that will be on line with what 
happened, but I think we are right to be a bit more pessimistic on the yield outlook going forward. We've had two 
years, we've got about two years of yield increases. And so I think generally we used to be – we will be conservative in 
our budgeting for yields for the next 12 months. 
But I think to the extent that there is going to be any surprise on yields, that surprise was more likely to be on the 
upside. But I think it's only an instinct to believe that the European airline industry has entered some new paradigm 
where yields arrive continuously. What I can say to you is that we will grow the capacity strongly again next year, a lot 
of the downward pressure on yields come from our own capacity growth, and I give you a flavor of that which is, I like 
the second point you raised about the Dublin seat capacity. One of the areas where we see yields falling at the moment 
is in the Irish UKP market, UK Provinces market. And we think a lot of that is due to the rate and speed [ph] which we 
have opened up new European routes into the UK Provincial airport. And to an extent, the, an enormous expansion we 
have launched this summer of new routes of Dublin into Europe. We are instead of paying only to [ph] high-fares, 
everybody has the choice to paying Ryanair's low-fares. So we are seeing some new declines despite no capacity 
increase, despite no competitive challenge on the UKP market, we are seeing yield declines at present and we think a 
lot of that is because of our own capacity growth. 
The other factor that should be lose [ph] in the next 12 months as well is remember, we don't have any baggage income 
or baggage charge income in this year's comparable whereas next year, you will have the comparable baggage revenue 
in this year's numbers. Gambling and mobile phones, so I think both of those, I mean we bring mobile phone license, 
we expect the greatest improvement by the end of June. The telephone supplier finds this as they think they are still on 
target to achieve that regulatory deadline. Therefore, we would expect to see some income coming in from the 
telephony in the second half of fiscal '08. Gambling at this stage is going very well on the website. I mean it's not a 
huge ancillary revenue stream at this stage. But it's a growing one, and it's one we think is going to continue to grow.

But say compared to the big ancillary items, which is car hire, baggage, the travel insurance and hotels, it's relatively 
small at the moment. 
The Marseille labor issue, frankly; there isn't an issue down there at the moment. We've launched the base. The French 
had passed a law which only the French could pass saying that now if you are employed in France, everybody should 
be paying French pensions. We've written both to the French government and to the European Union saying this is 
contrary to EU law. We are challenging it as are easyJet who already had a dawn raid on it. We would expect to have 
some kind of visit from the French authorities down in Marseille. But frankly, we have a very strong case, the, with the 
majority of the employees transferred into Marseille to operate or build out the Marseille base are non-French nationals, 
they have no intention of spending a long time in France. They are already paying their pensions, their social insurance, 
their taxes mainly in Ireland and none of them wish to or are willing to be or start paying French social taxes or French 
pensions, when ultimately they will be transferring back out of the Marseille base in any event. I suspect that it will 
become an issue for the European Union over the next 12 months. But it's not, while we may have some legal dispute 
or another legal dispute with the French authority, it shouldn't stop or alter the growth and expansion of the Marseille 
base. 
<Q - Joe Gill>: Thank you. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Howard, anything else you want to add maybe on, apart from the yield issue or no? 
<A - Howard Millar>: Well, I think it's just, I suppose we have seen a number of pieces come out is where the history 
of the airline industry has been at eight quarters since the most fares have risen, and I think it would be strictly if we see 
fuel prices soften into the summer period. We will obviously maybe unwind some of those fuel surcharges, but 
probably they will unwind very, very slowly. Do you think Joe, we would see is that given that we got an extra seven 
million passengers, we carry an extra seven million this year, plan to carry 10 million next year which is obviously 50% 
more, so, clearly that is a lot in a one-year period. So generally, I wouldn't disagree with Michael, and I think time [ph] 
and fuel surcharges may be the key factor this year and going forward. 
<Q - Joe Gill>: Fair fine, thanks, okay thanks Joe. 
Operator 
Thanks. And your next question comes from the line of Jim Parker from Raymond James. Please go ahead, your line is 
open. 
<Q - James Parker>: Hello Michael and Howard, good afternoon. 
<A>: Good afternoon, Jim. 
<Q - James Parker>: I'd like to know just a little bit about your outlook for non-fuel cost per seat, and historically, 
we've seen a pretty good pattern of those declining, the last couple of quarters appeared to be up, what is the outlook 
for your non-fuel cost per seat? 
<A - Howard Millar>: For the full year is it Jim or the outlook going forward? 
<Q - James Parker>: No, I am just going forward, looking out to fiscal '08 going forward? 
<A - Howard Millar>: We would expect to see obviously fuel costs continue to fall. Given that we have locked in 60 
million of cost reduction already, and obviously, what the impact would be on the remaining 30%, just we need to 
factor that in, but I expect that once the US [audio disturbance] staff costs will probably be driving at a slightly faster 
rate than the growth of our [ph] volume. A new regulation in Europe going forward in carbon crew which means they 
have to operate 900-hour flight limitation that we currently have, we think that we have to step up our cabin crew 
numbers. Obviously it's not a significant number in that average cabin in that average cabin crew, fare is lower. 
Certainly will be a factor going forward into next year.

Turning around the line, we took some pain particularly this year on our airport charges. As Joe Gill mentioned earlier 
on, we had a 200% increase [ph] in capacity in Dublin. Dublin is the most expensive airport we operate to. So, 
therefore our passenger costs – our airports, our passenger cost continues to rise. Next year, we have two things 
happening, one we have our charges as much closer to Dublin, and there are new bases that we've added this year and 
the ones we plan to launch for next year, will largely offset the higher charge that we have coming from Stansted. So I 
think overall, I don't think you are going to see the declines you would have seen historically, Jim when he had 7% 
declines in unit cost. I think we are into a period of much more modest declines, and I think somewhere in the region of 
3% is probably the appropriate level. 
<Q - James Parker>: So, Howard, you are suggesting that non-fuel unit cost? 
<A - Howard Millar>: Including fuel. 
<Q - James Parker>: Now, ex-fuel, if you consider... 
<A - Howard Millar>: Ex-fuel and staff cost. We think that would probably be down about 3%. 
<Q - James Parker>: Okay, ex-fuel, seat per – cost per seat should be down about 3%going forward? 
<A - Howard Millar>: Correct. 
<Q - James Parker>: Okay, all right. Thank you. 
<A>: Ex-fuel and staff, Jim. 
<Q - James Parker>: Yeah. 
<A>: All right. Thanks. 
Operator 
Our next question comes from the line of Chris Avery from J.P. Morgan in London. Please go ahead. Your line is now 
open. 
<Q - Chris Avery>: Very easy questions, where are you on pilot recruitment? Is the increase in cruise per aircraft over 
yet, and is there anything different about the Madrid base startup, given as a primary airport? Thanks. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Thanks, Chris. The pilot recruitment and development for this summer has all been 
completed in action prior to the reason for the jump in the fab cost has been it's the state's mission to recruit the pilots 
early and train them, but we have them all on line well in advance of this fiscal year. And where they come from, most 
of the captains are coming from our own First Officers, now being promoted across and continuing to recruit taking in 
today, and about 30% of our pilots in the last eight months are joining Ryanair from other airlines, other competitor 
airlines, mainly the other so-called low-fare airlines where the tenure [ph] as a pilot pay scheme and also the loss trade 
[ph] agreement to the First Officers need to be much more favored here in Ryanair. 
Any stream of the extent that they are [ph] recruiting experience of taking pilots are coming from competitors for the 
pay and the conditions here. Increased crews per aircraft, we won't have them today. The increasing – the increased 
ratio on the pilot crews has finished, now running at just over five crews per aircraft for a system match [ph] with four 
crews per aircraft. And under this new regulation, we have to increase the cabin crew now previously, they were four 
crews per aircraft. Over the next 12 months, we have to get that to about five crews per aircraft, not quite expensive at 
the pilot. And I, we missed the third part of the question? 
<Q - Chris Avery>: How mature the base staffs are. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Yeah, the costs per individual [ph] are higher, handling costs are higher than the average of 
our new bases, that if you take Marseilles and Bremen, they are significantly cheaper than Madrid. You can't get seeing 
that reflected, I mean at this time, you really wouldn't get it during the first month of operation, it's been nothing

reflected in higher yields at Madrid. The debate is profitable and we think it's going to great roles [ph] family. I don't 
think it will be our largest base in Spain. I think Barcelona would be larger than Madrid overall. So, we just, we will 
have to take a decision that we really couldn't develop the big business in Spain without having full impression in 
Madrid. I mean if we didn't go in and take up some of the spare capacity -- that it would tend to be shaken up by 
competitors that we would be blocked out by the marketplace. So I think it's useful for us to glimpse somewhere like 
Madrid, it also means you are keeping some of the other so-called low-fare airlines on us, by pinning down their fares, 
and you all take in the whole market, our fares in this case [ph] are significantly cheaper than the other so-called 
low-fares airlines over there. 
<Q - Chris Avery>: Thank you. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Thanks Chris. 
Operator 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Furlong from Davy in Dublin. Please go ahead sir, your 
line is open. 
<Q - Stephen Furlong>: Hello. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Yeah. 
<Q - Stephen Furlong>: A question on CapEx, can you just tell me what the plans are for CapEx going forward in 
terms of aircraft on balance sheet, your operating lease, and also of course, there is aircraft that are planned to be sold, 
just give us some flavor about what is the pricing dynamics about relative to the new aircraft you are coming on, 
obviously, the market is pretty buoyant for second-hand aircraft? 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Yes, the market is very buoyant on the second-hand aircraft, but again, it's not something we 
think will continue over the medium term. What's driving us in taking us, we have said in the first seven of our 99 
deliveries, the first seven of aircraft were sold at the back end of this year. And 
<A - Howard Millar>: 5.... 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: 5, I mentioned 99 deliveries, we are selling those because, a) it has gone over the 5-year 
period, they are covered by manufacturers, warranty, the aircraft have an engine warranty, warranty for winds and we 
are changing those with aircraft which do have a five-year warranty period which are fitted [ph] with the wind. And the 
pricing on the new aircraft is remarkably similar to the pricing which we are setting out some of the older aircraft. Let 
me calculate for the current year to... 
<A - Howard Millar>: 700 million. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: 700 million, that's a fiscal '07 deciding more next year, we are taking a site more aircraft next 
year, and the mix between operating lease and mortgage facility about every – we did a lot of operating leases in the 
third quarter. We will be doing as the debt financing in the fourth quarter. And so I think our ratio will be below the 
80% at the end of the year. But going forward into the coming year fiscal '08 actuaries about 80% owned about 20% 
operating leases. Operating lease market has been very, very attractive in the last year and a half and we felt it was 
appropriate to get some more value and do some more sale in these entering [ph] into third quarter where pricing was 
just tremendous. 
<Q - Stephen Furlong>: Great, can I just ask a question on yield again? 
<A>: Yes Mike [ph]. 
<Q - Stephen Furlong>: Just in terms of the competitive dynamics to see a policy depend on what happens to fuel 
surcharges a little bit, to think that it's a biggest driver of yields as your own capacity growth and you see in general the 
competition either a) you are just pricing for margin or actually getting out of your way in terms of new [ph] routes just

pulling or at least certainly to the extent that they are having any capacity but not having against Ryanair? 
<A>: I think I had argued this [ph] I am not sure that your proposed presumption is accurate, it's the -- to argue the 
biggest price run yield is fundamentally what competitor pricing and capacity growth... 
<Q - Stephen Furlong>: Okay. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: I think the instant dynamics got Europe now we have little capacity growth that will be taken 
on pan-European basis. Nobody else tried to have Ryanair go lesser than easyJet as any significant narrow body order. 
And if you look at the kind of the drag that takes capacity out of the marketplace particularly the markets where they 
can beat head to head with that [ph]. We eventually for example, I mean I know it's a one month snapshot and not 
particularly relevant but these drastic steps [ph] which were announced today. In the European market, there traffic 
decline by almost 6% in the month of December. Pretty less passengers in the UK less than half of Ryanair's traffic. 
<Q - Stephen Furlong>: Okay. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: So, we think that we complete, that will be the primarily driver. If you remember back I think 
about three years we had half of the earnings after years fell by almost 12 or 14% and now due to all of these idiots [ph] 
starting up low fare airlines all over Europe and everybody trying to be the next Ryanair. Europe seems to have gone 
through a lot of that almost all of Boeing and Airbus its narrow body orders between now and 2010 or 11 going into 
Asia, Latin America, China, and at the Indian subcontinent and therefore there may well be a combination for the next 
couple of years in Europe of stable capacity. More sensible management in lot of the European flag careers that have 
now been privatized and management is going around meeting investors on a quarterly or half yearly basis and having 
to actually deliver on cost reductions or control its capacity growth. Its hard to see to that won't continue for a year or 
two, but the difficulty is whenever, as Howard says, the outlook look this good, we usually have the next arm 
[indiscernible] again in the business and so we are very cautious at the moment. If we it looked, its good, its usually, it 
looks to good to be true it's usually is. 
<Q - Stephen Furlong>: Great thanks guys. 
Operator 
[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of John Sheehan of NCB in Dublin. Please go ahead 
your line is open. 
<Q - John Sheehan>: Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. First in relation to ancillary revenues I think in the 
first six months you are up on a per passenger basis by about 3.5% and I am just wondering and on underlining XBF 
[ph] that hotel compensation will open that kind of similar rates of growth on a per passenger basis in the quarter under 
review? Secondly, just the online check in, could you just give an indication of what percentage penetration you are 
achieving there in terms of passengers using that facility? And then, thirdly, just on baggage charges, you mentioned 
that they have been particularly strong presumably they have exceeded the kind of guided or a figure that you have 
talked in the past maybe around about €2 per passenger, do you seem that close to stabilizing at that level or are they 
looking to come back at it? Thank you. 
<A>: Thanks John. You have to forgive us on this, on the ancillary revenue line [ph] since everybody wants to know 
how much was the hotel expenses [ph]. We cannot disclose the hotel betterment [ph] its subject to a confidentiality 
agreement with the -- with the hotel partner, and the amount of the film [ph] is repayable if it leaks out. So, nobody 
knows and I am afraid, they are not going to know until the very kind of equivalent quarter next year. We are not going 
to threaten that payment by disclosing it. I mean the underlying figure on ancillary revenues continues to be strong. We 
op rate continues to run ahead of the growth of scheduled traffic but that's all, I am afraid, we can say at this stage. 
<Q - John Sheehan>: Okay. 
<A>: Online check in at the moment, we have about 20% of passengers using the pain free online, remember the online 
check in and the priority boarding is the same, it's a joint service. We have about 20% of people paying for it but only

12% of people using. And we expect that that will continue to rise. We are looking at means later on or as we move 
towards of summer of maybe forcing passengers who have or traveling with carry on luggage that they must while 
check in or must use the way of check in facility simply because we want to divert them away from airport check in, 
minimize queues at airports check ins also minimize our user need for airport checking facilities which are expensive. 
The baggage charges yes they are strong, they've been a little bit higher in the current quarter than our previous 
guidance which is about €2 per passenger and as that I would expect those to rise although not significantly in the next 
12 months. We will at some point in time in the future I do know when increase further the baggage charges not 
because we want to see the revenue but because we are determined to drive our force the 55% of the people who are 
presently traveling with checking bags downwards. We want to migrate if you like ultimately 60 or 70% of our 
passengers to traveling with hand or carry on luggage only. Bypass check in they can already board in [ph] they can 
have the web checking and continue using price to penalize passengers we checked in bags or to encourage those are 
two checking bags who travel with one or discourage one check in bags who travel with none. 
<Q - John Sheehan>: Just two of the questions if I can in relation to the Winglet what level of their penetration to fleet 
you have now at this stage with the Winglet's method and finally just on hedging for you mentioned to March '08 
presumably you've nothing done at this stage beyond then but its on the agenda? 
<A>: Yeah we need that the merger running at about 3 quarters of the fleet John and we got 130 and it's going just 
under, number is just under 100 at the moment. It will be over a 100 by the time by April or May. And on hedging at 
the moment we are looking out into Q1 and Q2 of FY '09 but we are not overly defensive to fuel price during the 
summer and then is trend downwards during the summer expect having in the last two years it actually spiked upwards. 
Our focus all the time though as always be to hedge the winter quarters where spot prices are very defensive to 
short-term weather consideration they jump from 52, 53, to $58 last week but those are cold snapping New York and 
London that kind of stuff and I think our focus would actually be more near-term, is there a near-term price that we 
treat as [indiscernible] Q1 and Q2 of fiscal '08, we are very happy with where we are for Q3 and 4, despite that even if 
spot prices stay down or at low mid 50s we'll be hedged at 60 an average of less, in that half year we take it frankly. We 
have cost certainty and powers that we've already tanked savings about €60 million for next year with hopefully more 
to come from the close out the remainder of Q1 and Q2. 
<Q - John Sheehan>: That's great, thanks. 
<A>: I should also say at the moment we haven't looked into the-- into the far range of the following year. The market 
is very nervous and I tend to arbitrage in a way any kind of comp facing away but you get beyond 12 months at the 
moment. 
<Q - John Sheehan>: Okay thank you. 
Operator 
[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Wober from HSBC in London. Please go 
ahead your line is open. 
<Q - Jonathan Wober>: Thanks very much. Just a few quick questions, first of all turn coming back on your unit cost 
guidance, you were talking earlier on about going forward roughly 3% forward, but you expect ex-fuel and ex-labor 
costs so on a per passenger basis. I think to remember, I think at the half year you were expecting that sort of rate for 
this fiscal year, but currently I believe you are actually up on a yielded cost basis ex-fuel and ex-staff costs, can you 
sort of say what's different, but what wrong. And then secondly on interest costs, net interest seems to be substantially 
low than you might expect just from the, if you have a difference between your net debt levels from previously, and are 
you guessing much better rates and how you are doing that, and then thirdly if you could just clarify again at the 
beginning you did talk in detail about the hedge prices that have on fuel. I didn't quite manage to get it all. Could you 
just repeat that for me please?

<A>: Jonathan here in terms of unit cost I suppose on the earlier part of the year we hasn't factored in the fact that we 
have very significant expansion as I said earlier on as in Dublin. Dublin in particular for instance the highest per 
passenger cost base that we have. We also have done Madrid as well. They certainly weren't in our original trend. 
During Q2 [ph] I think you will see is there is a lot of front-loading of cost particularly into winter period as we stepped 
up Michael said staffing numbers and to offset particularly pilot to offset leasing that we incurred at the back-end of 
last year. So, unit cost in terms of staff had been front-loaded and also we had a very heavy delivery program into we 
started in September and ran right through to the end of December with some of the aircraft coming in the last week 
and half before Christmas. So, I think what you will see in the fourth quarter, you will see unit cost will fall into the 
fourth quarter. We won't quite make up that gap that we had in terms of 3% but we will certainly be well over a 1 to 1.5 
and maybe an outside at 1.8. So, overall note that three is not deliverable for those reasons which I've said. In terms, 
really the highlights is where is really not in the factory. The structure of [indiscernible] particularly has been slightly 
longer average sector links is up this year by 5.5% which is a little bit more than we might have expected. But again 
that reflects the base developments particularly Marseille, Madrid and also some of the longer views which we 
launched from Dublin to Italy and over into Eastern Europe. And in terms of our deposit rate, some time ago, when we 
saw the deposit rates were starting to move up upward, we went into a more shorter position in terms of deposit rates to 
results being what you see in this particular quarter where deposit interest rates have risen, and so, our net interest 
charge has significantly declined from just under 9 million in the previous quarter down to 6 million. And so, also 
you've seen some rise in our cash balance as well. But we are shorter in terms of our position and we have obviously 
much more cash to deposit. In terms of fuel hedging, I think what we said is for the first H1, our cost per gallon will be 
6 or, our cost per barrel will be $61, with 50% already hedged and for H2, about $65 and 90% already hedged. 
<Q - Jonathan Wober>: Right. Okay, thank you very much. 
<A>: Thank you, John. 
<A>: Thanks John. 
Operator 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Mattimoe from Merrion Capital. Please go ahead. The line 
is open. 
<Q - John Mattimoe>: Good afternoon. A lot of my issues were covered in previous answers, but just in the 
follow-ups on the capacity side, Michael, just in relation to the capacity outlook you outlined for Europe, are you 
picking up any intelligence on any possible changes to that on – as regards any possible other big orders out of 
European carriers, any possibilities of European startups, or is there any other issues that may, could have the pace so 
to speak over the medium term which needs something maybe like if a startup wants to come in, that just have to pay 
top dollar producing companies or would it be a case that you might have to see some type of a shake-out in the cycle 
in Latin America or Asia to call the flow back of aircraft into Europe? 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Yeah, I think that's the, one of the issues that we raised this morning in some discussions in 
terms of what could go wrong to alter that dynamic, and it is some shock in the system. I don't think it's possible, and I 
think the aircraft, even if somebody would place a large order now with Boeing or Airbus, their earliest delivery date 
will be 2011. They don't have anything before that, the leasing companies at the moment are pretty much signed up 
through '08, '09 even it is 10. But frankly, if somebody starts off a so-called low-fares airline in Europe, with taking 
aircraft from leasing companies at the top to the bottom cycle, they won't belong for this third [ph]. 
It was interested, we looked at one of the more interesting, recent so-called low-fare airline floatation in Europe where 
their lease rate on Airbus was an A320, because the smaller fee capacities in our aircraft was more, was more than 
double Ryanair's equivalent cost. And so even if you can get aircraft, now they are very expensive, and if you have 
very expensive aircraft, you are not going to survive in competition with Ryanair in Europe over the next couple of 
years.

The concern would be, I mean I am not sure that a lot of the orders for those are for aircraft into India and subcontinent, 
into China, into the kind of, the rash of low-fare start-ups in Asia, Latin America are all that firm, maybe out of our 
orders. But I think if some of those guys will fall over before we get to 2011. Some of those aircraft might find the way 
back into Europe, it might put down pressure on airline, aircraft comps in Europe. But frankly at that stage, we will be 
so big and our comp base so low, and I don't see us going back to a scenario that happened two or four years ago at the 
time of the profitable earning where there was about five low-fare airlines out in Germany, charted airlines of getting 
into low-fare in that [ph] business. They have all had their fingers burnt and thankfully a lot of investors have had their 
fingers burnt, particularly those who invested in some of the more recent European so-called low-fare floatation; and 
some of them couldn't be described as a low-fare airline ever. And so, I think the dangers of some aircraft might 
[indiscernible] back in to Europe if there is big armageddon to enter a big kind of a structural impact on the market base 
but if that happens I think we will be back out looking to buy or order more aircraft for our deliveries in 2012 onwards. 
So, I would see both the threat but also as an opportunity John. 
<Q - John Mattimoe>: Okay thanks for that Michael. 
<A - Michael Cawley>: 
Operator 
Mr. O'Leary [ph] there are no further questions at this time. I hand the call back to you for any closing comments. 
Michael O'Leary, Chief Executive and Director 
Okay folks. Again, we have to leave you a message today. I think the underlying -- Ryaniar's underlying growth model 
is continuing to perform strongly. We will see significant capacity growth in the fourth quarter and we will maintain 
our 20% plus capacity growth in to FY '08. There will be significant upside for us and for I think a lot of other airlines 
in terms of lower fuel costs in the next 12 months. Obviously, we will do a little bit better because our comparable fuel 
costs currently in this year has been so high say at $73 in the last -- in the second half of the year. I would be though a 
little cautionary on the yield out for the next 12 months. I think we had a couple of very buoyant yield quarters. I think 
that has been driven by price gouging by a lot of Europe flag carriers with frankly, unsustainable and unjustified fuel 
surcharges. Around the edges APV may have a little impact over the UK on the downward -- slight downward 
compression on yields. So, I think I you are working on models on Ryanair for the next 12 months, the cost outlook is 
very good, the traffic growth outlook is very, the ancillary revenue should continue to be strong but you will have 
comparable in there on the baggage charges but I would be just a little pessimistic on yield for the moment. I'd be 
conservative on the yields. And then I think there is every chance it might be a pleasant surprise on the upside rather 
than downside. 
Other than that I have nothing further to add. So, again, thank you everybody for joining in today. For those who have 
invested in us in the last 12 months, I hope you are enjoying the Ryanair in today news. And for a few of them who 
have still have no sales on Ryanair will be urging to go and change them. And then on the back of our continuing 
rollout of bodies Europe's best and only low fared airline. Thanks everybody.
