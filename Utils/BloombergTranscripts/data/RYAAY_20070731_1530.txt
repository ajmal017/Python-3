MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION 
Operator 
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ryanair First Quarter Results 2008 Conference Call. 
[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand off to today's Chairperson, Mr. Michael O'Leary. Sir, please begin 
your meeting and I will be standing by. 
Michael O'Leary, Chief Executive Officer 
Okay. Thank you, Francis. Good afternoon ladies and gentleman. Welcome to the Ryanair first quarter results 
conference call. Enormous format, I am here with a group of guys in Dublin. Howard Millar is in London because he's 
doing the PR today. I will just go briefly going through the results for you through the MD&A and then open up to 
questions and as many answers as we can manage. 
Firstly to all of the results, the shareholder presentation, the MD&A has all been published on our website 
www.ryanair.com, together with the guaranteed lowest fares in Europe, so if you want either our results or the lowest 
fares please feel free to visit the website at your convenience. 
I am happy this morning: we announced the record first quarter profits up 20% to 149 million after tax. Traffic in the 
quarter grew by 18% to 12.5 million. Revenues rose 22% to 693 million. Ancillary revenues grew strongly by 53% to 
117 million primarily a gain due to the increased penetration across the entire range of ancillary product. So we would 
be talking about the last number of years. Ancillaries now are on target to account for 70% total revenues and we 
expect it to rise to about 20% over the next three years. 
Unit cost over the quarter has risen by 5%, primarily due to doubling of airport charges and in some cases significantly 
higher airport charges at Dublin airport and also a significant one off increase in staff costs, staff costs rose 34% to 75.9

million. That was due to our volume growth a significant step-up in cabin crew recruitment. There is also about 7 
million of average provision for share options which were granted during the quarter. 
In terms of key issues obviously, for us, it continues to be tackling costs. A lot of the slightly improved guidance for 
this year does not come from our void view on the yield environment. It comes from locking away our renegotiation 
costs and locking away those costs for the rest of the year and that's where the improved guidance is coming from 
today. 
The significant amount that is coming from reducing our sitting seven of our fourteen aircraft on the ground in Stansted 
this year. Stansted, the BAA Stansted has become a real problem for us. Not alone by far our most expensive airport in 
our universe but the service we are getting there and our partners are getting there currently is nothing short of 
appalling. As you know the airport has doubled its prices or its charges to Ryanair at April of this year and bad enough 
that we pay double the charges we're presently paying, but so far on top of that woeful security services, longer queues, 
frequent passenger and flight delays because passengers can't get through unmanned security or undermanned security 
at Stansted. It's just simply unacceptable. Passengers also now coping significant difficulties being stuck in long queues 
getting through passport control on arrival into Stansted. We have many cases of passengers who are spending more 
time either trying to get through Stansted security on the way out or passport control on the way back in due to under 
staffing than they are on board our aircraft. 
Part of our strategy with that end we have talked to Stansted over the last couple of months. We have been asked and 
we are trying to negotiate a lower cost to the airport agreement discount through the difficult winter period; being a 
monopoly and quite an extensive monopoly, they basically told us to go away, and so accordingly we've decided to sit 
seven aircraft on the ground there this winter. We will ground them from November through to probably early March, 
although we will probably be flying at some stage over the Christmas period and again with Easter coming in early 
March. 
Somebody has been asking why we won't lease them out, because we can make some money for them over the 
Christmas period and again in Easter which is coming early in March. And frankly there isn't much of a wait list market 
for aircrafts available from November through to mid-December coming also back again at Christmas and then we're 
getting back here in January until about the end of February. We will see some air talk at least business come those 
aircraft but fundamentally it is a bizarre situation at Stansted as it is now more profitable for us to sit aircraft on the 
ground than it is to fly them. 
And definitely generating significant cost saving profits at Stansted this winter; the aircraft where we have those slots 
for faulty aircraft the aircraft will fly again from Stansted next summer. But essentially as Stansted continues to 
overcharge for the fairly [expletive] abilities and the appalling service we have to endure over there, and we're frankly 
not going to fly flights where we're going to lose money by selling very low fares, and paying very high airport 
charges. 
We have complained about the BAA monopoly and the Stansted overcharge at Stansted to the regulators at the UK 
Civil Aviation Authority. They have all the regulatory power of – or they have all the regulatory spine of a poodle. 
Every time the BAA wants something the CAA will rollover and recommend it. We are viciously opposed to the 
CAA's recent recommendation that Stansted has no market power and therefore should be dedesignated. We recently 
had a meeting with the Competition Commission highlighting to them that the CAA are idiots, that Stansted has 
doubled the charges -- BAA has doubled the charges at Stansted this year, which is prima facie evidence not just of 
market power but in fact of monopoly power and abuse of monopoly power. We're strongly urging the Competition 
Commission to breakup the BAA airport monopoly. Anybody who has gone through London airport this year will 
realize this monopoly just doesn't work, and the idea that Stansted would be allowed to waste another £4 billion 
building a second runway and a second terminal that should be built for less than 1 billion is simply unacceptable to us. 
Sadly, we have similar issues here at Dublin airport, our favorite Irish airport monopoly, again run by a bunch of idiots. 
The evidence of that is more as we highlighted more recently with the DA's confirmation at weekend that they 
managed to spend €47 million on consultants last year -- that was equivalent to the 50 million total of annual profit they 
made in 2005. And more recently, we are objecting to their proposal to extend the Terminal One with a new shopping

area, it doesn't – they already confirmed on board for now that this new shopping area won't add whatsoever to 
passenger capacity, and it's passenger capacity is a problem at Dublin airport, not bloody shopping space. 
More recently, the DA have also confirmed that they have a new plan now to spend €450 million in total upgrading and 
refurbishing Terminal One, which is the awful facility our passengers endure at the moment. And at the same time they 
propose to reduce the capacity of Terminal One by 40% from 25 million passengers back to 15 million passengers per 
annum. Only in a regulated la-la land like Dublin would a government-owned airport monopoly get away with 
proposing to spend 450 million upgrading Terminal facilities with capacity they intend to reduce by 40%. 
Sadly, again, in Ireland we have an Airport regulator who is an idiot. He issued an updated report yesterday on the 
DAA's application for a Airport charges increase. While finding in this report that Dublin airport have significantly – 
having found his report yesterday, that the costs proposed by the DAA for the terminal extension are very high relative 
to benchmark evidence, and also found available evidence suggesting that the DAA has designed a new second 
Terminal with considerable excess capacity over what normally might be expected. He has decided in his wisdom to do 
nothing, which is as you know the preferred course of action for most aviation regulators – that is to sit on their hands 
while the airport monopolies piss away our money and then turn around and try to charge our passengers significantly 
higher airport charges. We, therefore, will continue to oppose, both at the planning stage and in court, the plans of the 
Dublin Airport Authority to waste hundreds of million of pounds building facilities that we neither want nor use, and 
all to lavish 50 million a year on idiot consultants submitting reports to a hapless aviation regulator. 
On the good news front, we'll shortly submit our appeal to the European Court of First Instance on the European 
Commission's recent decision to block our offer for Aer Lingus. As you know the offer is now dead in the water 
although it would have been anyway, even if the regulator had approved it, since the government and their trade unions 
who control 45, 47% of the company weren't interested in accepting our offer. It's interesting, however, though that 
since the withdrawal of our offer, which was a two year old 80 per share, the Aer Lingus share price seems to be still 
somewhere below two year old 50, which we think the market would share our view that there is a better way forward 
for Aer Lingus, but Aer Lingus's management don't seem to be aware of it yet. 
Nevertheless we intend to continue growth strongly over the coming winter. I would caution everybody there seems to 
be some excess euphoria this morning with this morning's results. This morning's results are good, but they're not great 
and the yield performance has been moderate, we got flat yield or 18% traffic growth. Unit cost increased to 5% to 
simply unacceptable, so we are going to be engaging in continuing to fight with airports, which has been the principal 
cause of the cost increase over the coming month and years. 
We have pretty good visibility on yields for the remainder of the second quarter or the summer period and we therefore 
could be are pretty confident that the yields, there's only small decline in yield for the second quarter. We have 
however no visibility and very few bookings at the moment for the two winter quarters and we would be very cautious 
about the outlook for yield this winter. We think it will be a very difficult winter. If you look at our principal market in 
the UK, passengers are now being robbed by government for doubled airport departure tax on EU destinations that's 
now £10 pounds per ticket or non-EU destinations like our London-Morocco routes passengers are paying up to n40, 
for a one way ticket. Add that and combine that with the doubling of costs in charge with Stansted airport, add to that 
the abysmal service the passengers are suffering at Stansted airport and we think many people will continue to believe 
this winter, "Look it's just not we are flying through the [expletive] airports at these high government taxes." And 
Ryanair simply won't be in a position to continue to lower fares that will absorb these increasing taxes and these 
increasing airport charges. So, we will be very cautious for the winter on yield. We have little visibility and therefore 
we believe that the yields in the second half was still, I fear likely to be followed by between minus five and minus 
10%. 
However, thanks to the cost reduction measures that we've implemented in the first half of the year, the significant cost 
reduction that will arise by grounding 7 aircraft, 7 Stansted aircraft this winter that will allow us to take out, or to scale 
down the recruitment, winter recruitment of some pilots, some cabin crew. It is certainly significantly reduces losses 
made by operating some of these new routes and new route development during winter period. We do now believe that 
we can give you a slight raise in the guidance for the year. For profits that we should expect now to rise by, somewhere

in the order of 10%, where previously we were guiding 5% increase. 
And, one fine point in the last few months, as you know we have announced the share buyback. We've completed at the 
moment about two thirds, I'm sorry, a bit more than that. We've bought back about 2.5% of the issued share capital and 
acquired about 37.6 million shares at a cost of about €187 million. The authorities, the shareholder authorities are 
prepared for us the buyback to expire with the AGM on September 20th next. Okay, that's it; Howard I'll hand it over to 
you and you take us speedily through the MD&A. 
Howard Millar, Chief Financial Officer 
Okay thanks Michael. Profit after tax increased by 20% to 138.9 million compared to 115.7 million in the quarter ended 
June 30, 2006. These results reflect an 18% increase in passenger numbers, that there including checked in baggage 
revenues and very strong growth in ancillary revenues. The growth in revenues is offset by a combination of increased 
airport costs which rose by 50% to €101.8 million arising from the doubling of airport charges at Stansted and higher 
charges at Dublin Airport, along with a one off step up in staff costs, due to higher cabin crew ratios which rose by 
34% to €75.9 million. 
Total operating revenues increased by 22% to 693 million, which was faster than the 18% growth in passenger 
volumes, as average fares remained flat and ancillary revenues grew by 53% to €117.1 million. Total revenue per 
passenger as a result increased by 4%, while the passenger load factor decreased by 2 points to 82% during the quarter. 
Total operating expenses increased by 25% to 535.5 million due to increased level of activity and the increased costs 
associated with the growth of the airline. Fuel, which represents 36% of total operating costs compared to 39% last 
year, increased by 14% to €190.4 million due to a decrease in the US dollar cost per gallon, and positive movement of 
the US dollar exchange rate versus the euro and a reduction in fuel consumption arising from the installation of 
winglets. 
Staff costs rose by 24% reflecting an increase in the cabin crew crewing ratios, and the airport and handling charges 
increase by 50% to 109.8 million arising from the doubling of airport charges at Stansted and the higher charges at 
Dublin Airport. As a result, unit costs increased by 5% and operating margins decreased by 1% to 23%, while its 
operating profit increased by 15% to 157.5 million. Net margins remained flat at 20% for the reasons we just discussed 
and earnings per share increased by 19.7% to $8.98 for the quarter. 
Turning to the balance sheet, the strong growth in profitability continues to positively impact the balance sheet with 
total cash increasing by 91.3 million to €2.289 billion despite funding a €40 million share buyback we'd only started the 
share buyback at the 30th of June and an additional 96.6 million in capital expenditures largely from internal resources. 
Total debt net of repayment decreased during the quarter by 22.2 million. Shareholders' equity at June 30, 2007 
increased by €94 million to €2.634 billion compared to 31st of March 2007 due to the 138.9 million increase in 
profitability during the quarter, the offsets of, sorry, the exercise of 2.9 million of share options on 47.5 million arising 
from the impact of IFRS accounting treatment for derivative financial assets, pension, tax, stock options offset by the 
share buyback as I mentioned above of €40 million. 
I'd just like to address some of the questions or part of some of the questions we know will come up. You will note 
during the quarter that the depreciation and amortization was 2% lower than the comparative quarter last year. This 
reflects a number of issues which I'll just deal with. First, as you're aware, since our 2005 unit buying, we are now 
adding new lower cost aircraft into our fleet. Our fleet levels are obviously being positively impacted by the 
strengthening of the euro against the dollar. However, we've also just recently entered into agreement to sell 20 of our 
aircraft. This has drawn our attention to look at things like residual value; historically residual value was 15% of the 
original cost of the aircraft. We've now increased that to 15% of the market value. 
And we've also looked at our maintenance or amortization provisioning and we have used the historical exchange rate 
of €1.20 for the dollar and given the recent movements over the last few years or so, we've now increased that to 1.30. 
This has a particular impact on engine maintenance and we just also experienced having gone through the first cycle of

heavy checks on the aircraft, eight year heavy checks, these checks are coming in less than we originally estimated. 
The combination of these factors has meant that depreciation and amortization has not grown in line with the growth in 
number of hours we've put on our new aircraft or upgraded and 50% of the reduction and depreciation and amortization 
due to the residual value impact and 50% due to lower amortization due to the impact of the exchange rate. The full 
year impact we would estimate of these is about €20 million and as I said 50% is reflecting the positive impact of 
residual value, 50% due to lower amortization charge. So hope that's cleared up that item for people and will help them 
with understanding the quarter. I'll pass it back to Michael for questions. 
Michael O'Leary, Chief Executive Officer 
Okay, thanks, Howard. Francis, can you open it up to questions now please? 
Q&A 
Operator 
Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Furlong. Please go ahead with 
your question, announcing your company name and city location. 
<Q - Stephen Furlong>: Yeah it's Stephen Furlong from Davy in Dublin. Good afternoon everyone. Okay just a 
couple of quick questions. One maybe on the revenue environment, you could talk to me about whether the strange 
weather pattern we are having in the summer, a record hot weather in Northern Europe. Has it any impact on bookings 
in the Q2 maybe late bookings July/August/September period? The second question, I note that the Q1 the ancillaries 
were exceptional and then maybe you could just give some color as to where those ancillaries have been particularly 
strong, and do you see that continuing? And then finally you might just go back again Howard, maybe this is for 
Howard, on the depreciations, I mean a couple of questions on that and in terms of your move from cost to market 
values and where do you get those values, are they from appraisers, or how do you determine that? And kind of 
corollary of that, we wouldn't be concerned if there is some downturn in the market and by your own admission the 
market is pretty hot right now and whether that is not being a conservative stance or not? 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Okay thanks Stephen. Revenue environment at the moment, it's hard to know whether 
weather patterns have that much effect on us. What drives the revenue environment and the booking [inaudible] is the 
rate and aggressiveness with which we launch seat promotions. I think there was no doubt that the, one of the reasons 
we [inaudible] full year results, [inaudible] bookings to be exceptionally good, exceptionally good weather we had now 
in Ireland and the UK in April and May. Clearly we've had [expletive] weather through July and August, sorry through 
June and July. But I think that [inaudible]. It's certainly helping bookings at the moment but then we've been very 
aggressive with seat promotions for the last two months, probably overly aggressive, and we've been out there 
aggressively marching the price guarantee and the price guarantee seems to be – is a good message. This is where we 
are offering it you can find a lower fare in any other than any competitor anywhere we will refund some of the 
difference. It's totally a compelling message because [inaudible] travel across all markets in Europe. But I wouldn't get 
too hung up on the weather, weather bad weather – I don't think it will make that much difference around the edges. 
And considering there haven't been, there has been no single exceptional thing be they all we have been working hard 
on penetration. If you remember we have been saying for the last two years in ancillaries within 15% we expected unit 
penetration would rise to about 20% over a five year period. Looking at the number of carry on baggage is now in there 
in the comparable [inaudible] last year. The one that isn't for its relatively in overall terms its small in priority boarding 
fees are in there. Baggage, or the excess baggage is in there and but we have got a very good performance in terms of 
penetration uptake across the board at hotels, car hire; a jump in intake spending as well. So we think more focused 
product on board and more aggressive pricing on board as well. Howard do you want to touch on the impact on 
depreciation point?

<A - Howard Millar>: Yeah, in terms of the – appraising [audio gap] the value we used a report prepared by three 
different appraisers. We took the lower end of the range and we haven't reviewed our residual values in 1999 since we 
got the first delivery, so some almost nine years later we had a look at it. And yes you are right Steve and the market is 
particularly harsh, it's particularly hot at the moment. But we took conservative range the end of the range [audio gap]. 
And given for example there is inbuilt inflation into market prices you know this is the indexation or escalation. 
<Q - Stephen Furlong>: Sure. 
<A - Howard Millar>: And we don't expect to be revisiting this for some time. So I think it is a lower range, 
conservatively priced, and I think it is appropriate if every, you know every so often we return [audio difficulties]. Do 
you have anything else on that Stephen? 
<Q - Stephen Furlong>: No that's great. That's great, thanks. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: I would stress as Howard has said you know we are talking about 15% of market value as 
opposed to 15% of the original purchase price. You know so it's not a – I mean it's not a significant number although 
[inaudible] of 130 aircraft, it becomes an important number. You know there's an argument at the moment, we have 
clearly re-projected giving that we are now selling these, selling some of our seven-year-old aircraft but pretty close to 
what we originally paid for them that there shouldn't be any depreciation at all. Now that would appear to be far too 
optimistic if you [inaudible] business but we are not talking about any kind of – it is still a very conservative 
depreciation policy. 
<Q - Stephen Furlong>: That's great. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Thanks, Stephen. 
Operator 
Our next question comes from the line of Chris Avery. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your company 
name and city location. 
<Q - Chris Avery>: JP Morgan in London. Three quickies, what happens to the 70 odd pilots who fly these 738s at 
Stansted over the winter, do they just go on short time working? Secondly do you depreciate the aircraft, ones that are 
on the ground? Presumably you don't. And finally when does the on air telephone start? 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Thanks, Chris. First to the 70 odds pilots they will continue to work through the winter. But 
we will slow down the rate if you remember last winter as you go back two years ago we had a shortage of pilots 
because of the bottleneck in training and simulator availability, we had to ground some aircraft to [inaudible]. Last year 
we probably over cooked the recruitments and probably over recruited pilots. This year we think we have a better 
balance but by grounding seven aircraft we are going to delay some of the pilot recruitment into the first quarter of next 
– of fiscal '09. And we got rid of some holidays and some backlog of leave, we will also allow maintenance to take or 
to undertake a significant – we're going to skew it off our maintenance this winter into November, December, January, 
February, which will give us more kind of usable hours during the – all of the spring and the autumn period. But there 
is a lot of reason, but I mean the core reason is simply to save the egregious charges we're being hit with by Stansted. 
[inaudible] taking the numbers of spare aircraft of genuine aircraft it will significantly improve our already market 
leading punctuality throughout the winter, because we simply have spare aircraft at most of our European bases 
throughout this winter. And depreciation we will still depreciate the aircraft while they are on the ground; if 
depreciation happens on an annualized basis, you cannot depreciate the after chip because you are not using it and 
OnAir we are still working with OnAir handset costs. They have achieved some of the regulatory hurdles in recent 
weeks. We would hope to have the first aircraft fitted by the end of this calendar year and begin to see revenues. We 
are running a trial period which will be in the last quarter, this fiscal year by the first quarter of calendar 2008. We 
would expect that roll out then to have – add significant proportion of fleet fitted for the summer of calendar '09. 
<Q - Chris Avery>: Calendar '09 or...?

Our next question comes from the line of John Mattimoe. Please go ahead with your question and answer your 
company name and city location. 
<Q - John Mattimoe>: Good afternoon. I am John Mattimoe from Merrion Stockbrokers in Dublin. A couple of 
questions if I may. First up, just in relation to the demand back has there been any change in the general demand 
environment since you updated eight weeks ago in the full-year results? Secondly then, just in relation to the yield 
trends you've outlined, your expectation for the summer, just in relation to Q3 and Q4, you [inaudible] this Michael in 
your opening comments but the reasons why you are expecting a tougher Q3 and Q4, is it mostly because the 
seasonality would be exacerbated by things like the APD and so on and that just exacerbates the price sensitivity in the 
quieter months? In other words you might need more use of the time, or is it down to tougher year-over-year 
comparisons and maybe with timing issues such as the baggage fees rolling up through the last fiscal year? And the 
next question then was just in relation to unit cost hours. At the 5% decline that you referred to, is that on a per 
passenger basis or is it per seat and it should – will it be roughly smooth over the four quarters or will it be a little bit 
more benign in Q3 and Q4 given that you will be growing back capacity in Stansted? And then lastly just in relation to 
the aircrafts, the aircrafts [inaudible] that you are having. Just in relation to the reason you're doing it is it mostly 
because of the high cost in Stansted, or is it just that maybe because of the increased fees out in the network, in other 
words is it happening in other airports rather than just Stansted? Just in relation to the mechanics of how it's happening 
will the 7 aircrafts just sit on the tarmac most of the winter, or would there be just maybe a mid week period and then 
they might be used on weekends, or would be moved to other airports? And then just in relation to [inaudible] the fact 
that's bringing back your capacity guidance for the year, does that have any impact or any of your volume incentives in 
any of your airport deals? And lastly is this likely to be an ongoing feature in the model in the longer term that you will 
be taking, taking aircraft out of the network during the winters? 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: You sure you don't have any more there everything there [inaudible] 
<Q - John Mattimoe>: I am sure you might, I might think of one or two more Michael when you are answering those. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: It's a hard job writing it all down. Okay I'll ask [inaudible] who is here with us to take the 
first two, the demand backdrop and the yield trend Q3, Q4 seasonality. 
<A>: Okay, John, the demand backdrop [inaudible] hasn't really changed, I mean the yield fall, just a half percent, has 
to be taken in the context of a couple of different things. Firstly, the bag revenue is included within that yield drop so 
about €2 out of the €46 is additional bag revenue over and above last year. And you remember when we introduced the 
bag charge, only part of the passengers traveling in the first and second quarters last year were paying for a bag charge. 
Passengers who would book prior to a previous date didn't have to pay the bag charge. Secondly, the year-on-year 
comparative and the winter includes a higher bag charge, which we had in the winter and therefore we won't get a 
benefit of that this winter -- year-on year yield decline looking at the bag charge in the winter period. Another element 
to consider in relation to the average fare just gone is that the APD – or sorry – the PSC in Stansted, the higher PSC in 
Stansted and the higher PSCs in Dublin are included within those average fares. So the underlying yield has actually 
fallen by more than 0.5% when you consider the fact that the PSCs are both low variables and are included in that 
average fare. So the demand scenario, the demands haven't really changed since we last spoke to you. Looking forward 
into the winter period, we would see the APD having a big impact, that's part of the reason for these aircrafts sitting on

the ground over the winter period. That higher bag charge – obviously in the winter last year, it was a bigger impact in 
terms of average fare decline winter-on-winter this year. And journey demand will be relatively soft over the winter 
period. We don't have any visibility on it at the moment, a very small level of sales from November onwards, given that 
the winter schedule has now only been on sale for about a two-month period. We are seeing the same kind of booking 
patterns this month, going forward, as we had this time last year – the traditional fill pattern, but as to what the average 
fare will be for those months, we can't put a clear picture on it beyond the October period at this point. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Okay, thanks, can I give the unit cost then here to – I'll give it to Neil Thornton, Neil the unit 
cost per passenger per seat? 
<A>: On per passenger rate – we are going through reduction there, coming through to the various size of that now 
refers that down the aircraft on the ground in Stansted, the cheaper aircraft coming through on the depreciation line, 
and also the cumulative reduction from our fuel hedging, we are 90% hedged to the end of the fiscal '08, and so it's 
coming through on a per passenger basis. 
<Q - John Mattimoe>: Sorry. If I can just clarify on that will the 5% be relatively smoother over each of the 4 quarters 
or will there be any timing differences? 
<A>: No I think they'll be relatively smooth, John. 
<Q - John Mattimoe>: Okay, thanks, Neil. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Okay, on the other issues, John, does the aircraft grounding – is it due to high cost at 
Stansted? Yes. We would – as I said, we wrote to Stansted and asked for a break on the cost this winter, in which case 
we would have continued to fly those 7 aircrafts. They basically turned around and told us to go away, and you can 
understand why – if they are getting double the charges and suffering a 20% traffic drop, they are still way ahead of 
where they would have been in the previous year, and obviously the CAA regulator hasn't got the brains to pick this up. 
We will sit the 7 aircraft on the ground – they will not fit on the ground in Stansted – again, if you sit them on the 
ground in Stansted you get stoned with parking charges, at almost all of our other bases, with the exception of Dublin, 
that other great regulated state monopoly, we don't pay any parking charges. So with this, we take the aircraft out of 
Stansted, we park them, spread them around and have a kind of spare or backup aircraft at more of our European bases. 
We won't fly them at weekends, although we probably will schedule some of them to fly over the Christmas period, 
and then they'll come back into service around the first or second week of March, because Easter next year is early, and 
we would want to be – we'll be announcing some more new bases in the next couple of weeks. A lot of those – we 
would want to start serving those around the Easter period, and there will be some opportunity for us again with some 
of the pilots to do some ad-hoc and rent-leasing stuff. But it will be Mickey Mouse in an overall context, we'll pick up 
the money for – over weekends when some other airlines are in trouble, but it will be immaterial in the context of our 
overall numbers. Our capacity guidance – I was running out of notes here, I don't – will it be a future – will be a feature 
of future winters? You have to ask the BAA Stansted that. If there is going to be a reduction in costs at Stansted then, 
no, we would rather fly these aircraft through the winter. But if we are going to be screwed for very high and 
unsustainably high airport charges at a shitty airport in outer Essex in the mid of November then frankly no, it will be a 
recurring feature. So it's very much, it is an issue of trying to re-educate some of these airport monopolies. We may not 
have a choice in diverting the aircraft to other airports, but that doesn't mean we're necessarily going to fly these planes 
through the winter and lose money while we pay you. And our capacity guidance, I missed one-- 
<Q - John Mattimoe>: Michael, just on the reduction in the capacity guidance or the traffic guidance – will that have a 
– is there any potential that that's having an impact on any of your volume assets in Stansted for running the airport? 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Yeah, no it won't. Mostly we have no – but because we're now paying full published charge 
for Stansted, there are no volume thresholds or anything else, and it's impact on other airports at the other end will be 
minimal. I mean, what we were trying to do is we'll be closing some routes for the winter, and in most cases, we've had 
discussions about the airports, they're more concerned to make sure they are getting them back next summer, than they 
are worrying about any missing traffic threshold. So it has no issue. 
<Q - John Mattimoe>: Great. Thanks very much for that.

Our next question comes from the line of Edward Stanford. Please go ahead with your question sir, announcing your 
company name and city location. 
<Q - Edward Stanford>: Hi, good afternoon. It's Edward Stanford from Cazenove in London. Just a couple of 
questions please. First of all, just carrying on the theme at Stansted, clearly it's not a very satisfactory point of view – 
from your point of view. What is the long-term solution, do you think you'll gradually migrate out of Stansted or do 
you just have to put out with the problems you are coping with at the moment? Secondly, just quickly on the share 
buyback, presumably you can renew the authority for the share buyback and do you have a schedule for when you wish 
to complete the amount to be returned? And finally, just on the present demand weakness, do you have any greater 
handle on what's causing it, is it principally air passenger duty or is there some underlying economic weakness 
affecting demand as well? 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Thanks Edward. First one, the long-term solution at Stansted, we remain convinced the only 
long-term solution at Stansted and Heathrow and Gatwick is to break up the BAA monopoly. We think they will be far 
better served by having – spinning those out into three separate, competing airports. Primarily because if there were 
three competing airports, the first thing each airport would do would be to start building additional facilities more 
efficiently and cheaply than the BAA can manage. We have already offered, repeatedly offered BAA Stansted that 
Ryanair itself would build a second terminal there and fill it – we could build at a cost of about 200, 250 million 
Sterling, a fraction of what they are proposing to waste. But while they continue to operate in their regime, they reward 
them by giving them – their income is set at 5 or 6 or 7% of their CapEx, there is no way they're going to look at lower 
cost CapEx solutions and while you have a bunch of idiots like the CAA regulating it and signing off on this abuse, 
nothing is going to change. We hope that the Competition Commission may call for the break up of the BAA monopoly 
and anybody who has passed through the London Airport, there has to be a better way than the kind of you know 
developing these black hole Calcuttas where the overriding objective is maximizing the retail spend instead of making 
it a pleasant and easy experience for passengers to get from the check-in gate to the boarding gate. 
Will we renew the authority for share buybacks? We will, I see no reason why we won't, and I think we should have it 
there on an ongoing basis. However we have a – and I said this at the last or when we had the annual results – we will 
complete the share buyback program of about 300 million and then that's it for at least two to three years. We are not 
revisiting it in the meantime. Do we have any timelines to complete the existing 300 million program? No, we don't, 
and I think we'll do it whenever we see the pricing opportunities to do so, in other words if it's advantageous in terms of 
P/E earnings for the remaining shareholders. You know we picked up a lot of stock under €5. In fact we've bought no 
stock over €5 in the last – during this program to date, and we're very happy if we can pick up shares in Ryanair stock 
at under €5, we think it's a great buy. Would we pay over €5? I have no idea, we'll continue to monitor it as it goes 
along, I think we'll continue to take advice from Davy and from Morgan Stanley, and – but there is no timeline, there is 
no pressure on us to complete it by a certain date or at all. 
Demand weakness, if you go back again to what was going on three months ago, I mean our difficulty was we couldn't 
identify why is there demand weakness. A lot of it we ascribed to a combination particularly in the UK market of 
doubling of APD, the doubling of the Stansted Airport's charges and also just how shitty the experience is getting 
through an airport – in and out of an airport like Stansted has a turn-off factor. I do think that that will, I think that was 
largely, or primarily the cause of it. We've responded to those concerns by, out there, being more aggressive in terms of 
price promotions, we've seen that coming through with increased market shares pretty much across the board in the last 
month or two. So I think the price weakness was probably short term but may well be again be revisited this winter. 
The jury is out there. It's – getting through the London Airport is not a pleasant experience. The APD is really is the 
most unfair, regressive and egregious unwarranted taxation, particularly the flat nature of it. People buying £1 fares 
from Ryanair shouldn't be paying 10 quid to Gordon Brown for some notion of environmental tax. But we think the

market is going to continue be very price sensitive. I do think over the medium term a price sensitive market is very 
much in Ryanair's best interest because we have the lowest fares. And anytime there is going to be a price war or a fare 
war, we will win it hands down because nobody else can compete with us on price or on cost. So frankly we welcome 
price wars and if there is going to be another price war this winter, we would quite welcome it. I am sure some 
shareholders would not, but you just got to learn this is a – we are playing a medium term growth game here. We intend 
to double the traffic and double the profits over the next five years and if there's the occasional bumpy winter then there 
is going to be the occasional bumpy winter. The only people who are going to worry about it are those people who are 
taking short-term positions in the stock.

Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Jim Parker. Please go ahead with your question, announcing your 
company name and city location. 
<Q - Jim Parker>: It's Jim parker with Raymond James. Michael and Howard good afternoon, just a few things here. 
One, you are going to have gains on the sale of aircraft, I gather those are not included in your 10% earnings guidance 
increase? 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: That's true, Jim. 
<Q - Jim Parker>: Okay. Now you talked about ancillary is going to rise from 17% of revenue to 20% over the next 
three years, can you elaborate a bit on the incremental items, on-board telephone I guess is one of them but what else is 
there? 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Nothing, there is no incremental items in that guidance. That guidance is rising over a 
five-year period from 15% of revenues to 20% of revenues. It's straightforward increased penetration of car hire travel 
insurance, hotels, in-flight sales and baggage and flight change fees. 
<Q - Jim Parker>: Okay. And it appears that easyJet's fares may be down as much as 7 or 8%; yours are off 0.5. Can 
you explain the difference there, is it back charges or what is it? 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Our underlying fares in the last quarter have been down, I mean as Shawn said it is being – 
we include the core baggage fares, that is the core that is check-in baggage payments in the passenger yield. So the 
market is soft out there. The underlying yields are down. We would – obviously passengers in the winter carry less 
baggage than they do in the summer, but we would welcome that. We want passengers with fewer bags. It's not – our 
long-term ambition is to actually have no check – well, very little checked-in baggage and not have the baggage 
revenue. We would then have much lower airport cost. So I think we did note that easyJet's average fares are down, 
Ryanair's average fares, stripping out the baggage fees, are down and we would expect that to continue through the 
winter. 
<Q - Jim Parker>: Okay, thanks. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Thanks Jim.

<Q - Joe Gill>: Afternoon, its Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin and just four questions. First off in relation to your 
passenger, staff and airport costs going up strongly in the first quarter and you've guided that's going to continue for 
most of this financial year and what's your thinking now in terms of how that's going to roll into summer '08 or summer 
'09 on a per passenger basis? I mean are you going to get back to some normal levels, do you see it plus or minus EPI 
or what's the sort of thinking on that? And second in relation to the aircraft sales and Howard mentioned earlier in 
discussing the depreciation issue that 20 aircraft have now been sold. Is that actually done on the spend and can you 
give us some insight to what that means, and in terms of financially how does it come through the account at the end of 
the year whether in the form of cash flows or the exceptional gains? And thirdly your marketing cost per passenger 
obviously it rose quite a lot from a low base and year-on-year in the quarter and again how long is that going to be 
sustained and what are the key items within that are pushing it up? And lastly in relation to the parked airplanes do you 
have any issues in terms of accessing slots of Stansted, is there any risk of the airports looking for some of them back 
and keeping them by not using airplanes? Thanks. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Thanks Joe and the first part of the question – it didn't come through, your line broke up. You 
want to know the airport and the staff costs rising how that will flow through to 2008 is it? 
<Q - Joe Gill>: Yeah just they went up quite sharply for... 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Was there something else in there [inaudible] just airport and staff? 
<Q - Joe Gill>: Just airport and staff. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Yeah principally airport and staff next year we expect will rise at a slower rate than revenues. 
The regulators came out this year and said that the DAA Dublin charges aren't – won't rise for another two years 
particularly in parking we believe there's going to be a significant rise there in 2009, and that it is going to restrain the 
kind of overspending that's going on at the moment and the situation in the UK is a little bit more unclear. At the 
moment there is going to be an RPI increase, the CAA has rolled forward the existing five year [inaudible] review 
thingy so the charges will roll forward from April '08 to April '09 at the last year, the current review, and then it 
depends on whether Stansted gets deregulated after that in which case we think they will try and jack up the charges 
again, or do they continue to be regulated, or does the Competition Commission recommend a break up? It's too hard to 
say. But those being the two biggest and most expensive airports, we would expect to see some price stability there 
next year. And who knows, Stansted may even learn from this kind of overcharging at the moment and our cutback this 
winter that there is a better way here and that is offering lower charges to passengers instead of trying to scalp them 
every time. Aircraft sales, there will be sales there this year, it will come through in the accounts in primarily in cash 
flow and as an exceptional item. With that I will take most depreciation as well. As to marketing cost per passenger 
there has been a rise, it's a relatively small number so don't get too concerned about the percentage increase. It does 
include, we put in there airport commissions are included in there from at the airports where they are selling things like 
excess baggage, change fees, and the big increase in that is coming from those airport commissions where we pay the 
airports and the handling companies commissions on some of those passenger charges and it works very well because 
that's one of the reasons we've increased the penetration by rewarding them with a commission on the sales. And so 
instead of just waving everybody through they tend to be a little bit more eager to collect. The [audio gap] at Stansted, 
the situation on slot is we would have the grandfather rights to those slots, winter and summer. However, by not flying 
those aircrafts this winter therefore we would not use, so we could [audio gap] them this winter. It's free for anybody 
else to come in to Stansted and take up those slots for the winter if they want them but they can't have them next 
summer because we would be using them again next summer. We have no difficulty flying the 40 aircraft out of 
Stansted during the summer but we are not going to fly the 40 aircraft out of Stansted during the winter at these high 
airport charges. Frankly and at the moment it looks like Stansted have made just a bollocks of the whole thing anyway. 
We are not the only ones announcing significant cutbacks at Stansted, already this winter Air Berlin has announced 
significant reductions in Stansted, as have SkyEurope and... 
<A>: [inaudible] 
<A>: No SkyEurope...

<A - Michael O'Leary>: Yeah SkyEurope are actually moving to Luton. Air Berlin have a significant capacity 
reduction and Ryanair now has significant capacity reduction and if anybody else wants to come in to Stansted and take 
up these [expletive] slots at the very high charge that the BAA are levying, frankly they are more than welcome to 
them, they won't last long 
<Q - Joe Gill>: Okay and just two follow-ons. On the aircraft sales, you have sold 20 at this stage, that's done and 
finished or not, and other thing coming through the company share about 10 have 20 actually been sold? 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: They're – because the contracts have been signed but the deliveries haven't taken place yet. 
<Q - Joe Gill>: Yeah okay. And last thing, sorry just on the buyback, has that passed back to yourselves now from 
[inaudible]? 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: I think it passes back towards [inaudible] this week. 
<Q - Joe Gill>: Okay. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: And then it remains – there would be an open period, it's about a month from Thursday, and 
then it passes back into the brokers during the close period.

Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Chris Reid. Please go ahead with your question announcing your 
company name and city location. 
<Q - Chris Reid>: Hi there it is Chris Reid from Deutsche in London. I've just got I think three. Just on the cash flow, 
sorry about this detailed question, the accrued expenses and the increase in that fell from 92.3 million to 36.3 on the 
cash flow, what exactly is this and sort of why has that fallen so much? And then a couple that are less detailed. 
Michael I mean I suppose it would be really great if you were sort of taking this winter capacity cutback as sort of an 
ongoing plan because I guess it would indicate more capacity discipline in the tough times. Are you sort of clearly 
saying that that's not the case and it's just a one-off or are you going to leave your options open? And then the last one 
just on the [audio gap], I haven't seen, I don't think you've moved already to an all-inclusive fare pricing structure, is 
that right? You know in the UK is that right and is it time to sort of move to that you know fairly soon and how do you 
think that should affect the way that people use the website and book on the sales? Thanks. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Thanks Chris, I'll take those in reverse order. On the website we are now all inclusive in all 
media advertising and on the home page of the website. The individual booking page at the moment can't be cut over to 
all inclusive because we are in the middle of changing over the entire software for the website to an updated version of 
Open Skies. We expect that to happen by the close or end of this calendar year. But the homepage, advertising, 
everything else is all-inclusive anyway. But we're in ongoing discussions with the OFT on that, but I think they've 
come round to the view having had a couple of meetings with the software providers themselves and they now realize, 
given the scale of Ryanair and the size of Ryanair it's impossible or impractical to cut us over – to make those booking 
pages all inclusive during the booking process. So the homepage is all inclusive and in the final page it's all inclusive 
but the individual booking pages which we would consider aren't advertising anyway are not yet, but will be either by 
the end of this calendar year or the first quarter of calendar '08. I think the issue for us Chris on the winter capacity 
cutback, look if it's profitable for us to operate these aircrafts during the winter then it makes sense to operate them. If 
it's not profitable then it makes sense to sit them on the ground. Now you know we had a, you know an exchange and 
correspondence with BAA Stansted saying if you give us a break on the airport cost this winter, we'll operate these 
aircrafts. I mean we won't make a lot of money but at least we won't lose money. You as well, we'll get another 1.5 
billion passengers this winter. But these guys you know have [inaudible] you know they have a poodle of a regulator, 
they know they can get away with these kind of charges, and frankly they are not minded to reduce the winter charges

unless somebody like Ryanair and the other airline customers start cutting back capacity. So I think it's important for us 
that we leave the carrot out there even to a rapacious monopoly like the BAA and to say that you know these cutbacks 
this winter may not be a permanent feature as long as you guys are a bit more customer sensitive in terms of the 
pricing, particularly during through the [expletive] winter period. I mean if all we do is say [audio gap], we're going to 
ground a bunch of aircraft every winter then there's no incentive for Stansted to start lowering charges particularly 
during the difficult winter period. And the accrued expenses I'm not sure the guys here were able to follow the 
question, were they? We can't track those numbers Chris, so maybe what it might be helpful would you just email 
Jimmy Dempsey or David here with a question offline? We'll give you the analysis.

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Light, please go ahead with your question sir announcing your 
company name and city location. 
<Q - Andrew Light>: Hi, it's Andrew Light, Citigroup, London. Hi there. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Hi, Andrew. 
<Q - Andrew Light>: Got a question on the capacity, reducing Stansted from 40 to – 7 planes, yeah. Is that from 
planned capacity or is that just based on the number of planes you have there right now? Just trying to get an 
understanding of the year-on-year change in capacity at both Stansted and overall in your network for the winter. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Well, the 40 aircraft base at Stansted, last winter there - 
<Q - Andrew Light>: Okay. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: – and there will be 33 this winter, so it's not planned capacity, it's the actual current capacity. 
If that make sense – I'm not sure I followed the question but in total we are taking out 7 aircraft out of 40 at Stansted 
and it would be 7 out of the total of 140 as we enter the winter period system-wide. So system-wide it's not a significant 
capacity reduction; at Stansted, it is significant. 
<Q - Andrew Light>: What would your growth in total seats be this winter then year-on-year? 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: I don't know. I mean if we continue... 
<A>: 21%. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: 21%. 
<Q - Andrew Light>: Okay, down from? 
<A>: [inaudible] 
<Q - Andrew Light>: Okay thanks. And can you give us an idea of which routes you will be pulling back on? 
<A>: Yeah we've cut a significant number of our French destinations, we've cut kind of frequency on those. We've 
taken out some of the higher frequency moves, we have taken out middle of the day frequencies and we've cut a 
number of routes there completely, things like Croatia will become summer only routes. A number of other routes 
across the network are being cut back. 
<Q - Andrew Light>: Okay. Just a couple of follow-ups. Number one, on your long-term fleet plan, you keep that 
constant, but you have lowered your 2011 passenger count by about 5 million. Is that just an anomaly or are you really 
planning to sell or cut back on further aircraft? And secondly, could you give us an update on your hedging for fuel and

<A - Michael O'Leary>: I will ask Jimmy Dempsey to take that. 
<A - Jimmy Dempsey>: In terms of our passenger growth after 2011, 2012 we do still have the flexibility and the 
Boeing delivery schedule hasn't changed. We do have the flexibility to increase the capacity but in order to be 
reflective of what we're doing in Stansted now we rejigged the numbers to show a reduction across the years just to 
show a comparison. 
<Q - Andrew Light>: But that increases, from about 2 million reduction to 5 within two years, so I was just trying to 
understand that, that big change. 
<A - Jimmy Dempsey>: It's about 4 million by 2012. But that's just reflective of, I can deal with this offline after, but 
it's just reflective of a shift in capacity across the winter months. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: The booking is down building the cost factor of winter of like Stansted and then having a 
lower passenger base. I assume we'll get the same cutbacks to happen in subsequent years but that's not necessarily in 
the plan. In subsequent years we will continue to talk to Stansted if the expense is beyond comp, we would be happy, 
we would be prepared not to reduce those capacities – the winter capacity. 
<Q - Andrew Light>: Okay. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: And remember, we still have the opportunity that we did last year there at the later years 
anyway if we want to increase the rate of growth again. But it will be much more, much tougher on airports like 
Stansted and Dublin and particularly the high cost to airport – the overcharging airports, if you want growth now, 
you're going to have to start coming up with lower costs because Simply told at these regulations you can build 
[expletive] Taj Mahal. And Jimmy, take the second part, please? 
<A - Jimmy Dempsey>: The hedging, we have, our jet fuel hedging position still remains the same. We have 90% 
cover across the next 3 quarters at the end of March '08 and we don't have any cover in place beyond that and we 
continue to monitor the market, although the prices currently in the market are higher than what we would have paid 
last year. Our price going for this winter is 10% below last year's price. So it's giving us a substantial saving there and 
our F/X rates in terms of the dollar rates we are benefiting in terms of the weaker dollar although on a sort of rolling 15 
to 18 month basis we do have 85% of the next twelve months cover at a 1.34 rate. So we are benefiting from that 
weaker dollar at the moment. 
<Q - Andrew Light>: All right. Okay, thanks very much 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Thanks Andrew. Anybody else?

Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Tim Marshall. Please go ahead sir, announcing your company name and 
city location. 
<Q - Tim Marshall>: It's UBS in London. Just one simple question on Stansted in any of your talks with BAA have 
they talked about seasonal pricing? Because I'm just thinking back to how it's regulated and tell me if am wrong but is 
it not based on the average price through the year, so they could in theory charge you less in the winter and more in the 
summer? 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: The regulatory regime is Stansted Tim is a price cap. They can do what they like below the 
price cap. The reality is what's actually happening and the bizarre thing that's going on at Stansted at the moment is the 
price cap is set on a per passenger price. And what they're doing at the moment is they're in fact overcharging currently 
because they are able to argue that they underrecovered in the earlier years at the current [inaudible] on a per passenger 
basis when the traffic was much lower. They are now overcharging to make up for the underrecovery in the earlier

years on a per passenger basis despite the fact that their traffic is now 20% ahead of their original and their – CAA's 
original forecast. So they were underrecovering per passenger in the earlier years when traffic was low; they are now 
overrecovering on a per passenger basis despite the fact that traffic is 20% higher than they originally forecast, and the 
morons in the CAA are simply sitting there idly on their hands going well, there's nothing we propose to do about this, 
in fact we think poor old Stansted should just be deregulated, now that they are screwing everybody. 
<Q - Tim Marshall>: But that their business is based on volume and if they charge you less in winter, they might put 
more volume through and then they will be able to charge more in the summer. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: At the moment with Stansted, I mean until you start cutting back capacity, until you start 
responding to this, Stansted will be of the view that their business is just screwing the maximum out of every passenger 
who goes through the building. And they are perfectly correct. I mean the CAA came out with some notion of nonsense 
in their determination, in fact this week on the Stansted determination where they were recommending de-designation 
and said that based on their price elasticity of demand, a 5% increase in cost at Stansted will lead to a 5% deduction in 
traffic and therefore the BAA would be mad to do it. Of course this ignored the reality which is a 100% increase in cost 
at Stansted mainly to about a 5% deduction in traffic and therefore they are absolutely correct to do it under this 
regulatory, you know the fundamentally [expletive] regulatory regime that exists over there. And it's just a case of you 
know the regulator over there is ineffective, he has long since been captured by the BAA. The BAA are scamming 
everybody, they are overcharging for car parking, they don't provide the security staff they are supposed to provide, 
they are underproviding left, right, and center and they are stealing money off airlines and passengers using those 
airports. 
<Q - Tim Marshall>: Okay, thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Neil Glen. Please go ahead with your question sir, announcing your 
company and city location. 
<Q>: Hi, this is Neil Glen from NCB in Dublin. Good afternoon. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Hi, Neil. 
<Q>: How are you? I have two questions in relation to the prospects for European expansion. And it was mentioned a 
couple of minutes ago in relation to reducing routes to France. Is that a function of the regulatory environment there or 
is it demand or is it a mixture of both? Also a considerable amount of new routes launched in 2007 have been from UK 
and Irish airports. Is that a reflection on the current, the current view of the years of violence throughout Continental 
Europe? Also and the amount of, the amount of leased aircraft has increased significantly to 25.6% of the current fleet 
in Q1. Is that just a timing issue? Further how are the new bases doing, in particular Madrid, which has obviously been, 
been pretty competitive from the start and also finally is there any news of when is there likely to be news on the 
Eastern European maintenance base? Thanks. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Thanks Neil. A quick one. The reduction of flights to France is that the phrase more because 
the French routes tend to be very seasonal [inaudible]. They perform very strongly in the winter, they perform very 
poorly, sorry, very strong in summer with southbound traffic from the UK and Ireland to regional France. So it's very 
little French originating traffic because the French don't tend to travel abroad. In the winter then that traffic, the 
southbound traffic dwindles because there are a lot of little destinations, particularly in regional France, don't have a 
high business content. And I would dispute your, the suggestion that the majority of the new routes this year are from 
Ireland and the UK, it simply isn't correct. There is a lot of new launches but most of, the greatest increase in capacity 
this year has been in three new bases in Marseille, Madrid and in Bremen, and that's where the majority of this year's 
additional capacity had gone. We tend to make a bit more noise about the individual route launches from Dublin and to 
a lesser extent from the UK but there's far more capacity in these – there is far greater capacity at Marseille, Madrid, 
and Bremen. The number of leased aircraft this year has increased steadily in line with our policy of taking a certain

proportion of the aircraft on operating leases and that has been well signaled to the market. The Madrid base is going 
well in terms of traffic, the yields aren't spectacular out in Madrid and the costs are high but there is a land grab going 
on in Madrid. I think we are probably the only airline making money to and from Madrid at the moment and we are 
quite happy to continue with that while the Clickairs and the [inaudible] and all the rest [audio gap] their brains out. As 
has happened before in a few of these land grabs we seem to be sitting there with the lowest costs and the lowest fares 
when they all finish blowing their brains out. And the last point I missed. Was there a last section, last--? 
<Q>: The Eastern European maintenance. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Oh yeah, the Eastern European maintenance base we have it narrowed down to two 
destinations at the moment and we would hope to select one by about the end of this calendar year. In the meantime 
however we turn to solve on a maintenance – large maintenance base in Stansted at the end of this month. We should 
start building there around, turn – or we go on site there at the end of August. It should be open, this would be I think 
about a 6 bay hanger, it will be open in about 12 months time, for September of '08, and we're close to signing up a deal 
for access to a large hanger facility in Frankfurt-Hahn, which will take care of most of our hanger facility requirements 
for the foreseeable future. Does that answer everything, Neil?

Our last question comes from the line of Travis Anderson. Please go ahead with your question sir, announcing your 
company and city location. 
<Q - Travis Anderson>: Travis Anderson -- Gilder, Gagnon, Howe in New York. Michael, I was trying to think of a 
question I could get you to elicit a strong opinion on. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Go for it Travis. 
<Q - Travis Anderson>: Well I thought I'd just ask a little bit about where you stand on some of your various legal 
battles with things like the Air France insider position in Paris and also then just generally the competitive situation 
what you are seeing other airlines do, you mentioned Madrid, anything else? 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: No, I mean, I will give you a quick flavor of the concept. The legal issues at the moment 
obviously the European appeal, the European Court of Appeal, their investigation will go in at the end of this month. A 
very strong case, we've narrowed it down to a couple of key points that really focus on where they have broken every 
precedent they ever established and the case will undoubtedly be helped if there was a move or a transaction involving 
Iberia or Alitalia, in the meantime where clearly they will flip-flop again and go back to the previous precedent. 
Anything that would help to demonstrate to the court that there is one rule for the flag carrier airlines in Europe and 
another rule for Ryanair will we believe help the case. Couple of other, more minor legal cases, there is a legal case 
starting very shortly in Italy where Inac the Italian CAA are attempting to block or reduce the number of slots available 
at Rome Ciampino by nearly 30%, from 140 daily movements to 100 daily movements this winter. They have 
manufactured some pretext that there is some work on the runway and therefore they need to reduce the number of 
movements. It's complete and utter [expletive], it's just another way of the Italian Government and the CAA trying to 
reduce the competitive pressure on Alitalia out of Rome. We will be looking for an injunction on that in the coming 
days. There are two cases pending against the Dublin Airport Authority; we'll shortly be launching another one against 
the Irish Aviation Regulator who ducked and fudged again yesterday in this decision. I mean they really are just utterly 
hopeless, but I am not sure you'd expect anything more when you take a civil servant and appoint them into regulatory 
positions regulating government monopolies. What should you expect, except nothing from them. And I think we'll 
have some success against the Irish regulator here. It's quite clear I mean even he now is finding that the DAA are 
overdesigning these buildings, that the costs are way above market, and yet he simply rolls over and rubber-stamps 
them anyway. So I think we'll have some success there and then in the UK we have two court actions pending against

the BAA and Stansted, but we're hopeful that the Competition Commission, and there is an awful lot of I think political 
support at this stage now for something to be done with the BAA. Heathrow is a shambles, Stansted is even worse than 
Heathrow, it just gets less publicity because most of the journalists tend to get stuck in Heathrow. And any model, or 
any business that operates a monopoly where the income is set at 5% of the amount of money you can spend on CapEx 
is bound to result in a situation like we have at the moment with the BAA where they just piss away money and then try 
and pass it on to us in the form of higher charges. But if somebody at the office or the CAA would stand by and say this 
mess at Stansted doesn't have any market power or that the BAA which controls 96% of the traffic to and from London 
doesn't have market power. It just goes to show how insanely stupid and incompetent these regulators are and so we'll 
have some fun with the courts. I saw some commentary there recently that our time would be better spent if we spent 
less time suing people and more time running the airlines. I think that shows a woeful gap, a knowledge gap. You 
cannot operate in the airline industry in Europe without continuously suing governments, suing flag carrier airlines and 
suing idiot regulators. It is the nature of the business over here, it's why the European airline industry has been so 
[expletive] for the last 45 years, because it's been run by governments and idiot regulators. Unless you keep suing the 
[expletive] we simply go back to a model that will result in much higher fares and [expletive] services to the customer. 
Only one airline delivers the lowest fares and the number one punctuality and the [inaudible] in Europe and it's the only 
airline that's not owned by some government [expletive] or regulated by some idiot regulator. And happily Travis 
you're a significant shareholder in that airline, as am I, I think the future is bright, apart from maybe some [inaudible] 
on yields this winter. 
<Q - Travis Anderson>: Okay and competitively how are things looking? 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Frankly competitively things have probably never looked better. I mean, I think the winter is 
going to be difficult. We are going to kick the [expletive] out of every other airline competitor we have around Europe 
because we have much lower comps. We have much lower fares and I think we have a compelling message for 
passengers now particularly with the price guarantee. I think you are going to see us put a lot more effort and resources 
behind the price guarantee this year because this is a compelling message and no other airline is able to match it. 
<Q - Travis Anderson>: Okay thanks. 
<A - Michael O'Leary>: Thanks Travis, give my best to Dick. 
<Q - Travis Anderson>: I will.

It appears there are no further questions registered, so I will hand the conference back to you for any closing comments. 
Michael O'Leary, Chief Executive Officer 
Okay Francis, thank you very much. Folks thank you very much for participating in the conference call today. Chris, 
Jimmy Dempsey is going to call, Chris Reid, Jimmy Dempsey will call you back on that other point offline. If anybody 
else has any other issues they are [inaudible] please feel free to route them back into us, we will be here for the rest of 
the week. And with that thank you for participating. As you know there is no road show on the first or the third 
quarters, so we will see you all on the half-year road show, which will be the first week of November, and other than 
that we are continuing to drive the business forward with much lower fares and much more aggressive cost controls. 
Thanks everybody. Bye bye.
