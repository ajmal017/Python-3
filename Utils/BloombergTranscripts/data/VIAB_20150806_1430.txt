Q3 Highlights 

Investments and Brands 

• 
Viacom continued to execute on our strategic plan, increasing our investment in outstanding creative content, 
building our international scale and capabilities and applying technology-driven innovations to both expand 
distribution and develop first-of-their-kind advertising platforms 
• 
There is no question that our industry is in the midst of significant change 
• 
Change can create uncertainty and concern 
• 
But with change also comes opportunity 
• 
And Viacom is seizing every opportunity 
• 
Many of our brands speak to the younger audiences that are at the leading edge of the evolution of media 
• 
This has always proven to be an advantage over the years and will again as we accelerate our investment in: 

• 
Initiatives 
• 
Platforms 
• 
And content 
• 
We continue to do the hard work to confidently move forward and lead our industry through the latest pivot 
Strategic Realignment 

• 
We have made necessary organizational changes at every level 
• 
As a result of our strategic realignment, the new, larger Music & Entertainment and Kids & Family Groups have 
made tremendous progress integrating their portfolios and accelerating investment in content 
Tut, Scream and Lip Sync Battle 

• 
Across the company, we have never spent more money on original programming as we do today 
• 
Tut, Scream and Lip Sync Battle are all new success stories for Viacom and the result of our deep commitment to 
invest in our programming and our future 
• 
In fact, we are doubling down on quality original programming across our brands, as acquired and syndicated 
shows are underperforming in today’s environment 
Ownership and Control 

• 
Our ownership and control of the vast majority of our content allow us to monetize across platforms and 
geographies 
• 
As a result of the continuing strength of our business and our financial discipline, we can continue to invest in all 
these important areas and deliver returns to shareholders 
• 
As previously announced, we will resume share repurchases in October 
Management Team 

• 
Urgency and acceleration are front and center 
• 
Our senior executives understand both the challenges and the opportunities we have ahead, and they and their 
teams are fully engaged 
• 
We’re nearing the end of our budget process for the coming year, and I can tell you that our teams and leaders: 
• 
Bob Bakish, the CEO of Viacom International Media Networks 
• 
Brad Grey, the CEO of Paramount 
• 
Doug Herzog, the CEO of our Music & Entertainment Group, Debra Lee, the CEO of BET Networks; and 
Cyma Zarghami, the CEO of our Kids & Family Group, are fully committed to our success 
• 
They have the company’s financial, strategic and administrative support to define the future of their businesses 
and brands and the authority to execute that vision 
Media Networks Revenues 


• 
Let’s take a quick look at the financial performance in the quarter 
• 
Media Networks revenues increased slightly, driven by affiliate fees 
• 
Absent the impact of foreign exchange, Media Networks revenues grew 2% 
• 
Filmed Entertainment revenues were significantly impacted by the timing of the summer slate 
• 
As you know, we scheduled the wide theatrical releases of our tent-pole films for the fiscal fourth quarter 
• 
This resulted in an expected decline in Film Entertainment revenues, which were $479mm 
• 
As a result, our overall revenues declined 11% to $3.06B. 
Operating Income, Earnings and EPS 

• 
Quarterly adjusted operating income was steady at $1.08B, and adjusted net earnings were $591mm 
• 
Adjusted EPS increased by 4% to $1.47, a record for the June quarter 
• 
While domestic advertising revenues in the quarter were down 9% and we expect comparable results in the 
current quarter, this significantly outpaces traditional ratings due to our substantial and growing next-generation 
advertising capabilities 
• 
These provide marketers with some of the most sophisticated and efficient products on the market 
• 
This initiative has momentum, and we’re continuing to scale as our client base quickly expands 
Vantage 

• 
Take Viacom Vantage 
• 
Vantage goes far beyond traditional demographics, integrating proprietary and third-party data to give advertisers 
the precision to customize the audience they want to reach and clear guidance to pinpoint the programming that 
best delivers on that target 
• 
Three months ago, I told you that we had piloted this platform and that we were committed to move 
aggressively 
Advertisers 

• 
I’m pleased to tell you today that Vantage is working with ten of the largest and most sophisticated advertisers 
in the world representing leading brands in a variety of sectors, including Automotive, Retail, Telecom, 
Financial Services, Consumer Products and many others 
• 
In fact, Vantage already is generating significant incremental advertising revenue, and that’s just a start 
• 
We have been investing in data and planning for this pivot for some time, and are committed to 
accelerating the rollout from here 
Media Networks Distribution 

• 
On our Media Networks distribution side, we concluded two successful carriage agreements in the quarter 
with Charter and Mediacom 

• 
Both of these deals expand our relationships, providing more programming in more ways to consumers, and 
delivering enhanced value for our brands 
• 
In addition, we continue to work productively with digital and over-the-top distributors to create innovative 
new experiences on a variety of platforms 
MVPDs 

• 
We are working with MVPDs to accelerate improvements in the consumer experience by increasing the 
availability and flexibility of on-demand viewing, focusing on multi-device access, co-investing in content and 
experiences and extending partnerships relating to data and monetization 
• 
We are also excited by the growth opportunity provided by mobile video, and we look forward to the 
prominent role our content will play in Verizon’s new mobile video offering 
International Operations 

• 
Before I get to the performance of some of our individual brands, I’d like to provide an update on our 
international operations, which we view as one of Viacom’s most important and underappreciated assets 
• 
When I became CEO, one of the first opportunity areas I identified was our markets outside the U.S. 
• 
Over the last several years, we have transformed Viacom International Media Networks from a collection 
of disparate channels into a strategically-integrated portfolio, leveraging content, technology and expertise 
across brands and regions 
• 
And we are just at the beginning 
Markets 

• 
Viacom already has enviable positions of scale in the world’s key markets 
• 
In the UK, the fastest growing developed economy outside the U.S., Viacom is the second largest, 
privately-held media network group 
• 
On the other end of the spectrum, we are one of the four largest media network groups in India, the fastest 
growing economy in the developing world 
• 
Our operations in Europe are successful and expanding, with new networks such as Channel 5, Spike UK as 
well as the Paramount Channel, which continues its rapid growth and has strong margins 
• 
Channel 5 has given us an additional original content engine, which has only begun to power our expansion 
in Europe 
Brands and Viacom 18 

• 
We have also undergone major expansion in Latin America, Asia and Africa, building our brands in countries 
with enormous headroom for growth in their own media markets 
• 
Since 2012, Viacom has increased the number of channels per country in international markets by 22% and 
expanded our pay-TV distribution by 50% 
• 
And even in the complicated Chinese market, we are establishing a position that is already profitable, albeit 
modestly so thus far 

• 
Prism TV, Viacom 18 Joint Venture 
• 
I’m also pleased to tell you that since the end of Q3, we closed two key transactions overseas 
• 
In India, Viacom acquired a 50% interest in Prism TV, which owns and operates popular regional 
entertainment channels 
• 
The Network 18 Group, our partner in the Viacom 18 joint venture, holds the remaining 50% 
• 
Viacom 18 is the fastest growing entertainment network in India, operating 10 channels, including MTV, 
Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and Colors, a leading Hindi general entertainment brand 
• 
This deal gives Viacom a significant presence in the fast-growing regional TV sector in India, where almost 
60% of the population speak regional languages 
New Networks on Sky Italy 

• 
In addition, we expanded our presence in Italy through the announcement of two new networks on Sky Italy, 
Teen Nick and MTV Next, a new highly-interactive MTV-branded channel 
• 
YTD, we have launched 16 new networks in our international markets, and there are more to come 
Media Networks 

MTV’s Scream 

• 
Now let’s talk in more detail about our Media Networks 
• 
MTV’s Scream, our newest scripted program for the network, has proven to be a bonafide hit with more than 
21mm viewers in its debut season 
• 
It was the number one scripted series launch of the summer across all ad-supported cable and MTV’s 
highest-rated series launch in a year among the core 12-to-34 demo 
• 
Scream continues to build 
• 
The series has consistently enjoyed viewership gains of more than 60% during the Live+7 period over the 
Live-plus-same-day and double-digit increases every week in viewing across digital platforms 
• 
We have renewed Scream for a second season 
VMAs and Miley Cyrus 

• 
Of course, MTV’s tent pole events still supply many of the most anticipated cultural moments on television, 
and the VMAs coming up later this month will be no exception 
• 
Miley Cyrus is returning this time to host for the first time since her breakthrough 2013 performance 
• 
Not surprisingly, the advertising response has been unprecedented 
• We are already sold out and expect to drive a second consecutive year of record revenue from the show 
New MONDAY Two-Hour Programming Block 

• 
Immediately after the VMAs, MTV will launch a new Monday two-hour programming block, including fan 
favorites Awkward and Faking It, followed by the all new Todrick and Girl Code Live 

• 
We will also launch our new MTV series, The Shannara Chronicles in January 
• 
As part of our commitment to accelerate delivery of original programming, Teen Wolf will return in January 
twice as fast as last year 
• 
We are also increasing the number of two-hour blocks across the MTV schedule and plan to air 23% more 
original prime-time programming hours in FY2016 
Original Programming 

Lip Sync Battle 

• 
Original programming is paying dividends at Spike as well 
• 
Lip Sync Battle has been a ratings champion since its launch in Q3, delivering record viewership 
• 
Over its nine-week initial run, Lip Sync Battle ranked number one in its timeslot in all of cable with adults 
18-to-49, averaging 2.9mm viewers and delivered nearly 200mm cross-platform digital streams 
• 
Spike’s three-night epic series, Tut, delivered an average of 2.2mm viewers, the largest average viewership 
for Spike in the timeslot in eight years, and a great majority of that audience was new to the network 
• 
A total of 27mm viewers consumed Tut content across digital platforms and VOD. 
• 
Building on that success, Spike is moving quickly and greenlighting its first scripted dramatic series in 
almost a decade with an announcement very shortly 
Nickelodeon 

• 
Nickelodeon also continues to create more great characters and original programming that kids love and drive 
that engagement through television, digital, mobile and consumer products 
• 
In fact, Nickelodeon is rolling out almost 200 premier episodes of original content in the next quarter, 
which will have an even greater impact as it reaches audiences on all of our growing platforms 
Nick’s Preschool Programming 

• 
Among 2-to-5-year-olds, Nick’s preschool programming dominated in the quarter and we plan to continue that 
by offering almost 100 new premiere episodes on the Nick Jr. block and channel next quarter 
• 
Nickelodeon was the highest-rated network in the preschool demo last quarter, owning all of the top five 
programs, including PAW Patrol, Blaze and the Monster Machines, Bubble Guppies, Wallykazam! and Team 
Umizoomi 
• 
The portfolio of preschool hits has translated into nearly 14mm full-episode views on the Nick Jr. app in 
the quarter 
Blaze and Make It Pop 

• 
Blaze, in particular, has been a breakout success across platforms as kids have watched episodes of the show 
millions of times over the quarter on the app and we delivered even more viewership of the show on TV VOD. 
• 
Blaze consumer products are now coming to the marketplace, reinforced by the continued outstanding 
performance of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 

• 
Among kids 6-to-11, the daily series Make It Pop is Nick’s number one show 
• 
Like Every Witch Way and Talia in the Kitchen, it is another validation of the network’s success with 
different formats and daily scripted series 
• 
Make It Pop will debut on Nickelodeon’s international channels beginning this summer 
Comedy Central 

• 
Comedy Central continues to be the number one full-day entertainment network among young men 18 to 34, with 
six of the top 20 cable series in that demo 
• 
And it’s even more successful beyond traditional measurement, with total consumption across platforms 
beyond Live-plus-3 up 52% 
• 
Comedy Central is hands down the premier destination for comedic talent, offering a supportive platform with 
outstanding resources, deep audience connections and a creative first philosophy 
• 
It has successfully partnered with comedians like Amy Schumer, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, and 
Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer from Broad City to create programming that creates broad cultural impact and 
attracts loyal, engaged fans who propel them into the zeitgeist 
• 
The creative excellence of the Comedy Central brand is exemplified by its recent haul of 26 Emmy 
nominations 
South Park 

• 
Comedy Central’s commitment to creativity creates unique opportunities 
• 
Perhaps this is best exemplified by South Park in our latest announcement with Trey Parker and Matt Stone, 
extending our enduring relationship with Stan, Kyle, Eric, Kenny and sometimes Butters through 2019 
• 
South Park helped define Comedy Central’s boundary-breaking mission and continues to be the number 
one comedy series among young men nearly two decades later 
• 
We are thrilled to be working with them as Trey and Matt take South Park past its 300th episode 
• 
The South Park team also is partnered with Comedy Central on cross-platform digital initiatives 
• 
In fact, South Park has extended its relationship on Hulu, providing broad distribution, deeper engagement 
with fans and outstanding value for Viacom 
Jon Stewart 

• 
We’ve been so proud of our work with Jon Stewart throughout his 16-year daily show run, which, as you 
know, ends tonight 
• 
Beyond his enormous contributions to advancing Comedy Central and Viacom, Jon has been an important 
voice in the national conversation 
• 
His legacy will live on within the well-oiled machine of the Daily Show, which will be welcoming Trevor 
Noah as the new host in September 
• 
We could not be more pleased about the next chapter for the show 

• 
There is a tremendous opportunity to build on that franchise with late-night television’s first millennial 
host, and we intend to make the most of it 
Pipeline and Seven New Series 

• 
Comedy Central has an extremely robust pipeline and an unparalleled ability to program its content across 
multiple platforms 
• 
The network is launching seven new series in 2016, including three animated series, which have strong appeal 
and a longer life across linear, consumer products and digital extensions 
Paramount Pictures 

Performance 

• 
Moving to Paramount Pictures, we are pleased with the performance of Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, 
which earned $120mm at the global box office in its first weekend 
• 
Terminator Genisys, also released this quarter, had a strong showing with more than $315mm at the 
worldwide box office to-date 
• 
We’re looking forward adding to that total 
• 
Both of these films open in China the next few weeks, the first foreign titles to play in that market since 
mid-June 
• 
With the success of our first Paramount animation feature, our unparalleled marketing capability and 
increased production across genres, the studio is stepping up its output and will be back up to its annual 
target of 15 films in 2016 
New Films and Paramount Television Operation 

• 
We’re excited about the new films in the pipeline including projects from Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell 
who are starring in Daddy’s Home this Christmas, Michael Bay’s 13 Hours coming early next year, followed 
by the epic retelling of Ben Hur and Ben Stiller’s Zoolander 2 in February 
• 
Our newly launched Paramount Television operation has already built a formidable slate of shows, with the 
first completed co-production Minority Report premiering on Fox in September 
Paramount Television 

• 
To-date, Paramount Television has nine shows ordered to production and an additional 12 projects set up at 
networks and major digital outlets 
• 
Paramount Television’s revenue is all incremental to our historical theatrical pipeline and the television 
sales cycle has the benefit of smoothing out the variability of our Film Entertainment segment 
Reinvigorated Film and Our New High-Growth TV Production Business 

• 
After a tough year, we believe Paramount is positioned to grow strongly next year and in the years to come, 
fueled both by a reinvigorated film business and our new high-growth TV production business 

Innovate 

Partnership with AMC and Cineplex 

• 
We continue to innovate in other areas 
• 
We recently announced a breakthrough partnership with AMC and Cineplex to close the gap between the 
theatrical and home entertainment windows for films that typically have shorter theatrical runs 
• 
It’s a forward-looking solution that works for us, the theater owners and for the consumer 
• 
We’re optimistic about this strategy and will see the benefit of this approach in future quarters 
EPIX 

• 
EPIX, our successful joint venture with Lionsgate and MGM, continues to develop its own slate of original 
programming 
• 
The network is beginning production this fall on two new series, Berlin Station, a spy drama from Paramount 
Television and Graves, a single-camera comedy starring Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon from Lionsgate 
Transition and Quality Video Content 

• 
I will conclude where I began 
• 
We are at the cutting edge of navigating the transition of our industry into the future 
• 
And we have positioned ourselves very well to do so 
• 
Our quality video content continues to perform well, with young, highly-coveted audiences 
• 
In the last quarter, Viacom was the number one family of cable networks as measured by Nielsen in the key 2 
to 49, 12 to 34, 18 to 34 and 18 to 49 demos 
Viewers, Multi-Platform Brands 

• 
An industry-wide consumption on nonlinear platforms continues to expand, particularly with young viewers, 
growing nearly 30% since 2011 
• 
This gives Viacom’s uniquely multi-platform brands and top-tier original content an even greater long-term 
advantage 
• 
That is why we continue to build our leadership position in multi-platform video consumption, and 
aggressively pursue better monetization of consumers’ deep engagement with our content through direct 
action and working with our affiliate, advertising and digital partners 
Organization 

• 
Our organization is streamlined and improved 
• 
We have invested in more and more original content, as well as cutting-edge data, marketing and measurement 
capabilities 
• 
We are successfully building an exceptional and high-growth international media platform 

Investments and Revenues 

• 
And we are investing in other growth initiatives, ranging from television production to film animation to mobile 
to consumer products 
• 
As we begin to look forward to next FY, we expect to deliver continued strong growth in affiliate revenues, a 
return to growth in our advertising revenues, a stronger slate and financial performance at Paramount, and the 
resumption of our buyback program to complement our strong dividend yield

Financial Highlights 

Before I take you through our operating results, I want to note that our earnings release and Web presentations 
summarizing the results for our June quarter are available on our website 

Media Networks Segment 

Revenues

Now let’s take a look at our segment results 
• 
At our Media Networks segment, revenues in the quarter were up slightly compared with the prior year 
• 
Domestic revenues were down 3%, while international revenues grew 22% 
• Excluding a 10% unfavorable impact from foreign currency, international revenues were up 32% 
• 
Channel 5 contributed 33 percentage points to international revenue growth in the quarter 
Media Networks Revenue Performance 

• 
Page 10 of our Web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks revenue performance 
• 
In terms of advertising, worldwide revenues were down 2% in the quarter 
• 
Domestic revenues were down 9% and international revenues increased 58% 
International Advertising Revenues 

• 
The increase in the international advertising revenues was driven principally by Channel 5 
• 
Foreign exchange losses had an 11 percentage point impact on the international advertising growth 
• 
In terms of affiliate revenues, worldwide revenues were up 2% 
• 
Domestic revenues were up 2% in the quarter, while international revenues declined 3% 
• 
Excluding the impacts from the timing of product available under certain distribution agreements, domestic 
affiliate revenues grew mid single digits in the quarter 
Foreign Exchange 

• 
Foreign exchange had an 11 percentage point unfavorable impact on the international affiliate revenue growth 

• 
Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, international affiliate revenues grew as a result of new channel 
launches, new distribution agreements as well as the timing of product available under certain distribution 
agreements 
• 
Expenses increased 1% in the quarter 
• 
Within operating expenses, programming expense grew 3%, while distribution and other expenses increased 
10% 
• 
SG&A expense was down 6% in the quarter 
• 
Increases in expenses were principally driven by the acquisition of Channel 5 
• 
Excluding the impact of Channel 5, total expenses were down 7% in the quarter, principally due to the savings 
from our recent strategic realignment 
Media Networks 

Operating Income 

• 
While Media Networks adjusted operating income was down 1%, the adjusted operating income margin 
declined 40BPS to 42.9% 
• 
Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted operating income was flat 
Filmed Entertainment 

Revenues 

• 
Moving to Filmed Entertainment, revenues were down 44% in the quarter principally due to decreases in 
theatrical and home entertainment revenues 
• 
Page 13 of the Web presentation provides a breakdown of Filmed Entertainment revenues 
• 
Theatrical revenues decreased 92% due to the timing of our summer tent poles 
• 
Transformers: Age of Extinction was released in the June quarter of last year, while Terminator Genisys and 
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation were widely released in the September quarter of this year 
Home entertainment Revenues 

• 
Home entertainment revenues declined 30%, principally due to lower revenues from third-party distribution and 
catalog titles 
• 
Ancillary revenues declined by 43%, due primarily to a comparison in the prior year related to the sale of certain 
distribution rights 
• 
Filmed Entertainment generated adjusted operating income of $48mm in the quarter as compared to $55mm 
for last year 
Tax Rate and Interest 

• 
Moving to taxes, the YTD effective tax rate was 31.8%, reflecting a 30-basis-point improvement as compared to 
the prior year 

• 
In terms of non-controlling interest, the increase of $11mm in the quarter principally represents the minority 
interest share of income associated with the renewal of a content distribution agreement 
Thomas E. Dooley 

Operating Highlights 

FCF and Working Capital 

• 
I’m going to talk about our cash flow, our debt and the return of capital to our shareholders 
• 
I’ll also cover seasonal factors impacting Q4 our 2015 FY. 
• 
For the quarter, we generated $380mm in operating FCF compared to $571mm last year 
• 
Page five of the Web deck presentation provides the components of FCF 
• 
The decline in operating FCF in the quarter was principally due to higher working capital utilization and 
higher cash interest 
• 
Working capital was impacted by increased TV programming spend, as well as production spend for the films 
including Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 
Debt, leverage and Dividend 

• 
Now moving on to our debt, it remains principally fixed rate, with an average cost at quarter end of 4.7% 
• 
At quarter end, we had no variable rate borrowings outstanding 
• 
In terms of our leverage, we ended the quarter with $13.1B of total debt and $421mm of cash and cash 
equivalents 
• 
Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.1 times 
• 
At June 30, our $2.5B bank revolver was undrawn 
• 
In terms of capital returned to shareholders, we increased our quarterly dividend by 21% to $0.40 for our July 
payment 
• 
If you include this dividend payment, we have returned a total of $2.1B to shareholders in the FY, which is a 
return on market capitalization of approximately 10% 
Revenues, Organic Growth, Programming Expense and Tax Rates 

• 
Now, let’s turn to some of the factors impacting our fourth quarter and full year 
• 
In terms of our affiliate revenue, quarterly revenue will fluctuate given the timing of transactions and the 
recognition of revenue related to certain distribution agreements that are tied to product availability 
• 
Accordingly, for the September quarter, we anticipate that worldwide affiliate revenues will grow low double 
digits 
• 
For the full year, we expect that the organic growth rate for Media Networks programming expense will be in the 
low- to mid-single digits 

• 
However, factoring in the acquisition of Channel 5, reported programming expense will grow in the low- to 
mid-teens 
• 
For 2015, we are forecasting a book tax rate of 31.8% 
Filmed Entertainment 

• 
Moving on to Filmed Entertainment, given this year’s mix of theatrical releases as compared to last year, on a 
full-year basis, the studio will face difficult bottom-line comparisons 
• 
As we look into FY2016, in October, the studio will release the final installment of our Paranormal franchise 
• 
Other December quarter releases include Ring, the third installment of the Ring franchise, as well as Daddy’s 
Home 
Outlook 

Production and Development Pipeline 

• 
Looking ahead at the studio’s production and development pipeline, Paramount has wrapped production on 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2, Zoolander 2, which stars Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell; and The 
Big Short, which is based on the best-selling book by Michael Lewis and stars Brad Pitt, Steve Carell, Christian 
Bale and Ryan Gosling; as well as the CGI-animated Monster Trucks, which is directed by Chris Wedge 
• 
And they are currently in production on Star Trek 3 as well as Story of Your Life, which stars Amy Adams 
and Jeremy Renner 
• 
Paramount is in development on a number of sequels to existing franchises, including World War Z, Jack 
Reacher, Transformers, The SpongeBob Movie, and has announced this week the sixth installment of Mission: 
Impossible 
Summary 

In summary, while the industry continues to evolve, we are taking significant steps to realign our businesses to address 
these challenges 

We have rethought our organization structure, reducing costs in certain areas while investing in our brands, technology 
and new capabilities 

These investments have enabled us to monetize our content outside of traditional measurements through the 
development of specialized ad sales products 

• 
These offerings provide incremental value to our advertising partners by using targeting to drive efficiency in 
their marketing campaigns 
We have also invested in our international media networks over the past several years 

We continue to launch new channels and brands, building scale in key markets 

And we have entered into long-term distribution and ad sales agreement with key partners, positioning our international 
networks for growth 

We remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders through our dividend and buyback programs, 
while, at the same time, maintaining our investment grade status 


QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION 

<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Understanding you don’t talk about specific distributor agreements, maybe you can give us 
some color just on a general level about your ongoing renewals, how we should see affiliate growth going forward, and 
maybe how we should assume the mix will be between traditional affiliate growth vs. digital sales. 

<A - Philippe Dauman>: As I mentioned in my remarks, we successfully concluded the two agreements that were up 
in the last quarter, Mediacom and Charter. We look forward to renewing other affiliation agreements going forward. As 
I mentioned also, our networks constitute the leading family of cable networks out there, and particularly in the key 
demos that are driving adoption of new services, whether it’s broadband, utilization of other devices and so forth. We 
are working very closely with our partners, even before renewals, on how they can better engage those consumers so as 
to drive success of the ecosystem. 

We think there’s a lot of work to be done. It is happening. I’m happy to see better consumer interfaces and better 
availability of video product for consumers and that will help both the distributors and the programmers. So, I have a 
lot of confidence in continuing to execute on that. 

And as far as our affiliate revenue growth, we will continue to deliver in this year and the years to come the high 
single-digit affiliate revenue growth. We have many long-term agreements in place. The organic rate increases under 
these long-term agreements average out in the high mid-single-digit rates. When you add to that the two, three points, 
depending on the year, of growth in new distribution opportunities, whether it’s SVOD, new over-the-top services, new 
players, opportunities presented by renewals, you get to that high single. And we’ve managed our portfolio of renewals 
such that we have a pretty long view of most of our agreements with a few coming up. So I have a lot of confidence in 
the continued growth of our affiliate revenue. And that’s domestically speaking. 

On the international front, as we roll out new networks, as we execute deals, such as the recent one that we did with 
Sky Italia, the extension of our Sky UK, launching new networks, as you look in the long run, I also see affiliate 
revenue growth to be a steady driver for many years to come in our international marketplace. And again, new 
technologies there in the international marketplace are a real upside opportunity for us. 

I touched on China. Part of the reason we are modestly profitable already in China, where, as you know, it’s hard to 
launch actual television networks is, there is a growing number of indigenous SVOD players in that marketplace. So 
we’re able to introduce our content there. We’re working on other revenue opportunities, consumer products, other 
areas that are open to us in that marketplace. Obviously, the film market is really growing well for us in China. We 
look forward to growing that. But that’s just one example of a number of opportunities available to us in growing these 
new forms of revenue. 

And mobile, I touched on mobile. It’s a very exciting opportunity. Mobile video distribution affiliate as well as 
advertising will begin to be a significant and rapidly growing opportunity as we head into the next FY. So we are 
extremely well positioned, owning our content, having the content that appeals to young audiences and having content 
that we can roll out around the world. 

<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: If I can just squeeze in one more about Paramount. You’d made a big push into the TV 
business at Paramount. I guess what metrics should we see from the outside looking in, in order to get a read, I guess, 
on the potential financial success or profit contribution down the road? 

<A - Philippe Dauman>: I’m very pleased with the early success of what is really a startup business. It’s certainly a 
great environment to be starting this, particularly with the talented executives and other talent relationships that we 
have over at Paramount. So, as we get series on-air and we’re getting them on air in multiple networks starting next 
month, those series that get renewed obviously have a lot of profit potential. The good news is that we’re able to run 
this business on a very low structural overhead and we’re also able to essentially largely cover cost of production based 
on the deals that are available in today’s marketplace, particularly when you fold in international distribution 
opportunities with respect to the content. 


We also view the television operation as strategic for our Media Networks. There is a lot of interaction between the 
Paramount Television Group and our cable network groups. And as we go more and more into scripted series across 
virtually all of our networks, the Paramount Television Group is an in-house source of high-level creative talent. And 
that is something that you will see unfold as we go forward with already several series picked up by our networks. And 
EPIX, our pay service joint-venture is going to have high-quality television series for the first time next fall, which will 
continue to drive value for EPIX in the future. 

<A - Thomas E. Dooley>: And in terms of profitability, Alexia, it’s very – as Philippe mentioned, it’s very 
cost-effective in terms of its startup. It does have some cost implications in the first two years. But once we get into the 
second year, as these shows become successful and carry on, we would expect in the second year and third year they 
become – begin to become significant contributors to the profitability of Paramount. 

<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: A couple for Philippe and then one for Tom and Wade. Philippe, I think about a year 
ago, you updated us on the percentage of subscriber base that’s covered by deals through 2018. And I wonder when this 
year comes to an end given what you’ve done with Charter and Mediacom, maybe a couple more, what percentage of 
your subscriber base in the U.S. is covered by deals through 2018? 

<A - Philippe Dauman>: I don’t have the precise percentage. It would be well over 70% once we get through this 
round of deals, perhaps verging on 80% 

<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: And then as of last night, if you look at where your stock was trading, the multiple is so 
low that it’s one of the cheapest stocks in S&P 500. So I wonder what do you or the board think about doing to be more 
aggressive to higher the intrinsic value of the assets? Would you consider spinning assets or accelerating the buyback 
when it happens next year to capture maybe the early part of the year’s value? So what are you and the board thinking 
about intrinsic value here? I’m trying to get that value to be reflected in the stock price. 

<A - Philippe Dauman>: I think the market action on the stock has been way overdone, considering the inherent 
value. But we’ve outlined in our presentation today all the initiatives that we are taking. The growth that we have 
ahead, the balance in our revenue streams going forward, the inherent value of our international portfolio, the fact that 
we are at the leading edge of taking advantage through our direct action and working with our partners who are also 
improving the consumer experience, which will drive monetization value, having – being able to drive better 
monetization of advertising opportunities through addressable advertising, whether it’s on video-on-demand or 
otherwise, will stabilize and allow us to get back to growth on ad revenues. 

The asset value at this price level is – the asset value of the underlying assets far outpaces what’s reflected in the 
marketplace. Even before you get to our operating businesses, if you just look at what’s below the line, Michael, if you 
take the value of our joint-venture interest in EPIX, in our very successful Viacom 18 joint venture in India, even the 
hidden asset, we own spectrum of some low-power stations that were once used in connection with one of our networks 
that are not used. When you add all that up, just that, and I haven’t even touched on our operating businesses, you have 
several dollars per share of value. You take the value of our international operations and you look at how our 
international operations are valued around the world and the high growth for many, many years ahead, I leave it to you 
analysts to figure out the value of that. And you take Paramount, you take – and then you get to our Media Networks 
business, which has multiple opportunities ahead. 

The mobile video opportunity is, in fairly short order, a potential hundreds of millions of dollar a year opportunity. And 
it will – it is – given the direction in which the major mobile companies are going, this is a particularly significant 
opportunity for us. So, we have in the past gone through these market dislocations. And we obviously – as you know, 
we believe in our stock. We are resuming our buyback program in October. As Tom said, we are going to conduct in a 
responsible way over time and keeping in mind that we want to maintain our investment grade rating. But the stock, 
once we pass certain milestones, will reflect our performance. And it’s certainly not reflecting it today. 

<Q - Michael B. Nathanson>: On casual conversion from EBITDA. So when you get past this year, which I know had 
some one-timers, what’s the right level to think about conversion rates from EBITDA the next couple years? 


<A - Thomas E. Dooley>: I think it’ll remain consistent as it has in the past. I think the cash flow generation 
capabilities of the company are terrific and very, very strong cash flow, which provides us with the confidence to 
continue to buy back our shares and return capital to shareholders. So that’s one number we focus on very carefully, 
even though that provides us with a significant amount of money to continue to reinvest in new and original 
programming that we control outright both here and around the world. 

<A - Philippe Dauman>: And I might also add, when I talk about international growth, we are funding that on a 
current basis. So when we launch networks, we are expensing that as we go along, that’s part of our expenses. And so, 
this is a great investment that we are putting in, and, in many cases, rapid high-margin networks like the Paramount 
Channel, as we build our business. 

<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Why don’t we focus on advertising a little bit more, Philippe? You gave a couple 
forward-looking comments, one, September quarter down comparable levels to June. Then you also said next FY, 
you’re anticipating returning to ad growth. So first on September, is there room for upside or downside to that number 
based on ratings deliveries or other dynamics? And then, can you just walk us through the path to get from what is 
down high single digits to returning to ad growth? What needs to happen with ratings or measurement? How much is 
contribution from the digital and targeting efforts that you’re undertaking? Thank you. 

<A - Philippe Dauman>: We obviously are still only in the early part of the second month of the quarter. And so, we 
are not assuming immediate ratings improvement and giving our prognostications, so we’re giving you our best guess 
and trying to be realistic about the quarter. 

The reason that we have a view that we are going to resume growth in advertising revenue in the full FY next year, is 
that obviously, we had a tough year this year. We have begun to expand the scale of our targeted advertising initiatives, 
the Viacom Vantage, Viacom Velocity. We’ve added a lot of human resources to those efforts. It was an important part 
of our upfront discussions with major advertisers. And by the way, given the overall difficult nature of the upfront 
marketplace, which the overall television market was down in volume, we did well and came very, very close to the 
level of volume that we had last year, notwithstanding what took place in the ratings. 

We have a larger volume of signature original shows. We have more event shows we are building. We have more 
scripted series, these are higher-value. And we are increasing accordingly our ad revenues from significant advertisers 
who want to engage with those kinds of programs on our networks. 

And again, our distributor partners are enhancing their own products and we’re beginning to see some ramp-up in 
things like dynamic ad-insertion in video-on-demand. I mentioned new products in the mobile arena also offer 
advertising opportunities. So, we feel that we are going to be able to climb back up as we add all those different factors 
in. 

<Q - John Janedis>: You talked about the ratings issues and [ph] increased original (48:56) programming. But can 
you talk about your expectation on when it should contribute to the ratings improvement across the group? And do the 
changes on the programming or personnel front change the timeline at all? 

<A - Philippe Dauman>: There are several aspects to the, what I’ll call, the measurement issue. We want see more in 
the ratings that matter. There’s more and more delayed viewing of programming. So obviously, the Live+same-day 
ratings become less and less meaningful as we go forward. So, I think in terms of what is the currency today, the C3, 
there’s a lot more viewing taking place in that 2 and 3 part, then there’s also more viewing taking place beyond that, 
and there’s also viewing taking place on other platforms. This is where our Viacom Vantage product, which we have 
now introduced in a major way with 10 of our largest advertisers in different sectors, and we’re going to add to that 
number, allow us different measurement metrics to complement the traditional ratings and therefore improve 
monetization. 

What we found across our schedule is that we have better ratings on our prime day-parts. Where there is significant 
weakness is in other day-parts where you have a lot of repeats, off-network syndication, this is true across television. 
So – and that’s in part because there’s a lot of choice on the part of viewers. This is why strategically, we are increasing 
the amount of original programming. And a lot of it, as I mentioned, whether it’s animation, whether it is serialized 


low-cost programming that we run across day-parts, for example, on Nickelodeon, we are working to improve the 
performance of those day-parts. 

The original shows that we are launching, particularly when you add the other viewings taking place, measure fully up 
to what we were achieving on shows that aired over the last several years. So, a show like Bella and the Bulldogs is 
performing at the same kind of level when you add the – there’s delayed viewing on all the rest as iCarly did when it 
launched. So, this is a process that’s not overnight, day by day, but it’s a continual adjustment which we’re doing. The 
personnel realignment and improvements that we’re making are bearing fruit already. We are accelerating, accelerating 
is a word we use a lot here at Viacom. So we are accelerating our efforts to speed up next seasons of shows that work, 
like the Teen Wolf example I gave you. 

We’re accelerating the development and production of the kind of programming that works, whether it’s scripted, 
series, animation, events. We very recently had the second annual Kids’ Choice Sports Awards, which is a new event. 
And it is a very successful and popular show with advertisers. The BET experience also recently launched and 
continues to grow year-after-year. So we’ll continue to look to add the kind of programming that works particularly 
well with the young audiences and the millennial audiences. That includes on-air talent. 

I am personally very excited about the potential of Trevor Noah on The Daily Show in reaching and bringing to that 
great show a younger average audience, which is a hard audience to reach. We are, if you want to get reach on young 
audiences, if you want to get kids, if you’re a toy company, Nickelodeon’s the place to be. So we are being extremely 
proactive and taking all measures that are necessary to address the changing media landscape, and it is a changing 
media landscape. I think we’ll come out on the other side in a much stronger place. 

<Q - John Janedis>: Speaking of the young audiences, by the time we get to the next earnings call, we’ll be into the 
Hard Eight. And the headlines around kids’ viewing have been well documented. So can you update us on the kids’ 
upfront and maybe the kids’ market in general? 

<A - Philippe Dauman>: When I said we did very well in the upfront, we did very well in the kids’ upfront. So one of 
the flipsides of our having challenging ratings on Nickelodeon is that some endemic advertisers who had thought that 
they could get into their scatter market to get into that Hard Eight to push some of their product found that they 
couldn’t get in not because we didn’t want them to come in, but we had scarcity. And so, we had a lot of scarcity in it. 
So, some of these players came back in into the upfront marketplace. So we believe we have made adjustments. That’s 
in answer to an earlier question. That’s why we have optimism that the situation on ad revenues will improve as we get 
into next year. In part, it’s the fruit of our labors in addressing the issues that we saw. 

<Q - Vasily D. Karasyov>: I think yesterday, one of your distributors was making comments on diminishing value of 
kids’ content given the Netflix usage and things like that. So, I was wondering if you could give us an idea how your 
conversations with Charter progressed and how the viewership, nonlinear viewership that you highlighted on previous 
calls of your product, including Nickelodeon, MTV and so on, how much of effect it was? And do you feel like you 
were able to get value for that? 

<A - Philippe Dauman>: As I said, we successfully concluded, you mentioned Charter, we successfully concluded our 
renewal with Charter. We have a good strong relationship. I assume it will be a growing relationship as the transaction 
we have in progress continues. And we talk about – we have a common interest with our distributors. Our common 
interest, as has existed before, is to work together to improve the value of the ecosystem of the consumers. Now, there’s 
work to be done there. Charter is an example of a company that is being proactive in providing more video-on-demand, 
more availability of networks on multiple devices inside the home, outside the home. As those initiatives come to 
fruition, the value for the consumer will expand. The churn rate should improve. 

So, there is a very positive impact on having, on the distribution side, forward-looking operators who will build the 
ecosystem, which benefits both sides. Because the value of what they’re offering consumers depends on the content. 
And we and many of our competitors are continually increasing the value of the content. We are producing more 
original programming. We are less reliant on old shows, 20, 30, 40-year-old shows. We are providing fresh content 
that’s going to be usable in more ways. And so, we view all distributors as our partners. And as we do renewals, we 


discuss all these new services. And we, as I said, in some cases, we are full marketing partners with them and 
promoting our services, but also the value of the overall products. 

<Q - Omar F. Sheikh>: You called out a couple of times the great potential at Channel 5 in the UK. I wonder whether 
you might be able to give us some idea of what sort of growth expectations you have for ad growth this year and next 
year, and also whether you think there might be some opportunity for the introduction of retransmission fees in the UK. 
There’s a lot of talk about that in that market at this point. 

<A - Philippe Dauman>: As it relates to Channel 5, the deal that we have done with our partner, Sky UK, was a 
pre-existing partnership that involve our cable networks. We did a very significant deal where we extended our 
affiliation agreements for multiple years. And we worked together and they will be handling our advertising inventory 
along with our cable networks. That is a very positive step. As you know, Channel 5 had some issues with one of the 
advertising agencies in the UK. Entering into the Sky UK deal resolves that issue as we go forward. So it was a very 
significant deal. Channel 5 is proving to be a very important and successful strategic acquisition for us. 

As I mentioned, it made us the second largest private media network company in the UK. It gives us a lot of 
programming heft which benefits us in the UK, but will also fuel a rapid expansion of our networks, especially in 
Europe, as well as driving our consumer products business, and of course it came with a lot of favorable financial 
attributes, which lowered the effective purchase price. As far as retransmission possibility down the road in the UK, I 
don’t know what will happen there. It’s certainly not an immediate prospect. It’s not something we factored in in our 
acquisition plan nor in our strategic plan. And we’ll see where that goes, but we are not at all dependent on that and 
moving our overall UK business forward in a very positive way as it has.
