Perfect. Thank you very much. You may begin your conference. 
Good evening. This is Michael Partridge. Welcome to Vertex's second quarter financial results conference call. Our top 
priority remains the late stage development of telaprevir, while maintaining a strong financial position to enable 
commercialization of telaprevir and the advancement of our pipeline. The first half of 2009 has been marked by steady 
progress towards these goals and we see continued opportunity to build value in our business in the second half of the 
year. 
In the second quarter, we completed the telaprevir dosing portion in our Phase 3 trials, an important event in this 
registration program. Also in the second quarter, we initiated a Phase 3 registration program for our lead product 
candidate VX-770, targeting the orphan disorder cystic fibrosis. 
Financially, we have taken steps to improve our balance sheet through an amended agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe, 
which places our pro forma cash position at more than 850 million at June 30, 2009. At the same time, we reduced our 
2013 convertible debt outstanding from 288 million to 144 million. 
Now looking ahead to events in the second half of the year, the SVR24 data from Study C208, which is evaluating 
twice daily dosing of telaprevir, has been accepted as an oral presentation as part of the Presidential Plenary session at 
AASLD on November 3. 
We are also conducting a multiple dose viral kinetic study with VX-222 and we are about to start a drug-drug 
interaction study with telaprevir and VX-222 this quarter. These studies will support the first study that combines these 
drug candidates in HCV patients. This study is planned to start as early as the fourth quarter. 
Following me on today's call will be prepared remarks from Matt Emmens, Ian Smith, Dr. Peter Mueller, who is 
joining us from Munich, Kurt Graves, and in addition, Dr. Bob Kauffman, our Chief Medical Officer, who will join us 
for Q&A. 
I will remind you that information discussed on this conference call includes forward-looking statements, which are 
subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, including our 10-K. GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call. Information 
regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP is available in our 
second quarter 2009 financial press release, which can be accessed on our website. 
Unless otherwise noted, all 2009 expenses and guidance discussed in this call are inclusive of stock-based 
compensation and executive transition expenses, restructuring expense, acquisition-related expenses, and loss from 
exchange of convertible debt. 
I'll now turn the call over to Matt. 
Matthew W. Emmens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
Thanks, Michael. As you know, I joined Vertex as President in February and took the reigns as Chairman and CEO this 
May. I want to begin this call by telling you what I've been up to and provide some thoughts about the company's 
current position and how we plan to become a fully capable and profitable biopharmaceutical company. 
We're focused today, as you would expect us to be, on doing everything we can to make our HCV and CF program 
successful. That is executing and development, submitting the NDAs and building the commercial capability that 
enables us to develop these markets and establish market leadership. But we're not just launching one or two drugs. 
We're creating a brand-new company. 
What I'm focused on, along with the management team, is putting in place the strategy and organizational structure at 
Vertex to make all of this happen. From my firsthand observations at our research sites, consultations with the Board

and discussions with the management team, I can tell you that Vertex's most important differentiating feature is 
innovative research, which provides opportunities to develop and commercialize products. It's how we got telaprevir. 
It's how we got our cystic fibrosis drug candidates, and it's how we created our JAK3 [Janus kinase 3] inhibitor 
compound. 
The ability to discover and subsequently develop important medicines is the basis of our business. It's also where we 
believe much of our future growth will continue to come from. In the future healthcare market, the most important 
thing is going to be to demonstrate value to payers. We will do this by focusing on leading edge science, science that 
can create innovative compounds that address unmet medical needs and can be clearly differentiated. 
We believe that today this is the only viable way to compete successfully. We believe that science is our competitive 
advantage and the investment will pay off. I mentioned strategy. We are planning to be a profitable, highly successful, 
independent biopharmaceutical company with participation in multiple therapeutic areas. This requires continuous 
R&D investment. 
We are financially strong, but we need to closely manage our cash investment, both today as we are bringing telaprevir 
and our CF programs closer to market, and in the future, where we will also be focused on growing the bottom line. If 
we can retain rights to even more of our pipeline compounds in the future, we firmly believe that it can drive 
remarkable value creation for you, our shareholders. 
Regarding structure, I'm working to achieve a tighter integration between the research, development, and commercial 
teams within Vertex to better prepare for the future. For example, I've asked Kurt, who heads commercial, and Peter, 
who heads R&D, to work together to define a unique structure that will allow for a more seamless transition from 
discovery all the way through to the market. This is conceptually simple, but it takes work to achieve in practice, and 
it's very important because the payoff in terms of alignment effort is huge. 
There is tension today, as there should be, between the investments that our pipeline requires, our business needs, our 
desire to retain rights to medicines we have created, and ensuring that we are adequately capitalized to progress these 
opportunities ourselves. I am working closely with Ian, as well as Peter and Kurt, to balance our opportunities with the 
fiscal discipline that will support strong shareholder returns in the future. 
Before I turn this back to Ian, I'd mention that we will see a lot of important data from Vertex over roughly the next 12 
months. We will learn more about how well our CF compounds work when dosed over long periods of time and in 
different patient subtypes. 
We will see how well twice daily telaprevir performs. We will see early indications of how well the combination of 
telaprevir and VX-222 does in knocking down the HC virus in patients, and of course, we will get all of the Phase 3 
data from telaprevir. 
I realize that most investors in Vertex today focus primarily on telaprevir and hepatitis C. With the completion of 
dosing, we wait optimistically for final Phase 3 data. However, my job is to look to what's next. Our success will be 
defined not only by telaprevir, but what opportunities we address beyond that, and we have many opportunities. 
Our protease inhibitor, our cystic fibrosis compound, and other compounds that are either about to enter the clinic, or 
are in earlier development, all have the potential to change diseases, change lives, and change the trajectory of our 
company. 
I, along with our researchers and our Board are intensely excited by the prospects we see ahead. There were many 
reasons that I chose to join Vertex at this time. I can tell you today that they have all been confirmed. 
Ian, over to you.

Thanks, Matt, and good evening to everyone. I'm pleased with the progress we've made in 2009 financially. We 
completed the second quarter with $754 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and now adding a 
further $105 million to our cash position as a result of successfully amending the 2004 agreement with Mitsubishi 
Tanabe, resulting in a pro forma cash position of more than $850 million as of June 30, 2009. This is a strong financial 
position to support the advancement of our business. 
Our internal focus has been on advancing HCV and CF registration programs, and maintaining our operational and 
financial flexibility. This has involved making disciplined investments, raising capital and reducing our existing 
convertible debt obligations; and thirdly, pursuing business development activities to raise non-dilutive capital, all of 
which are directed at maintaining a strong financial position to support the company through to a cash flow positive 
position, while managing our capital structure for shareholder return. 
We are executing well against these priorities. From a financial perspective this year, we are adding approximately 
$420 million to our balance sheet through an equity offering and a business development transaction. 
From a capital structure perspective, we've reduced our debt obligations by 50% and now have $144 million of 
outstanding 2013 convertible debt, which has a conversion price of approximately $23, and is callable in February 
2010. 
In the second half of the year, we have additional business development in out-licensing activities ongoing that may 
further add to our 2009 year-end cash position, including the monetization of our telaprevir European milestones. We 
continue to progress this initiative, with several parties and may add to the cash position we already have. Furthermore, 
progress in out-licensing activities could result in further cash and revenues. In view of these ongoing activities, we are 
reiterating our 2009 non-GAAP loss of 400 million to 435 million, and our year-end cash position of approximately 
700 million, therefore, taking a strong position into 2010. 
In summary, we are focused on building financial strength in our balance sheet that is positioning us nicely to continue 
to invest and build our business as we progress into 2010, our planned telaprevir NDA submission year. 
Now, to the second quarter 2009 financial results; the numbers I will review here are important measures. However, at 
this stage of our business, we think the true financial measure is that of our cash position, our common shares 
outstanding balanced against the future cash investment required to move the company to cash flow positive based on 
the products we expect to commercialize. 
Now to the income statement for the quarter; the second quarter 2009 non-GAAP loss before certain charges was 
approximately $129 million, compared to a second quarter 2008 non-GAAP loss of approximately $74 million. 
The increase was primarily attributable to a reduction in collaborative R&D revenues, as we received a large milestone 
payment in the second quarter of last year; with no comparable payment in this year's quarter. The GAAP net loss for 
the second quarter of 2009 was approximately $171 million, compared to a GAAP net loss of approximately $91 
million in the second quarter of 2008. 
Total revenues for the second quarter of 2009 were approximately $19 million, compared to 69 for 2008. We expect the 
amended agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe will contribute to quarterly revenue in the second half of the year, as a 
result of amortizing the $105 million payment received upfront over the period of the telaprevir development and 
registration in Japan. 
Total R&D expense was approximately $139 million, compared to approximately $130 million in the second quarter of 
2008. The investment continues to primarily support the development programs of HCV, cystic fibrosis, and new 
product creation from research. 
Our second quarter SG&A expense was approximately $33 million, compared to approximately 26 in the second 
quarter of 2008, an increase primarily resulting from our commercial plan, as we prepare for the launch of telaprevir. 
I'll close by repeating my earlier comments, that we're focused on our cash position, capital structure, and the 
investment to support the company through being cash flow positive.

At this time, it is the key measure in our business, and we anticipate entering 2010 in a strong financial position, with 
approximately $700 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We may also add to this position, with 
further product out-licensing activities and the monetization of our European Telaprevir milestones. 
Peter, over to you. 
Peter Mueller, Executive Vice President, Global Research and Development, 
and Chief Scientific Officer 
Thank you, Ian. Can you hear me? 
Ian F. Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 
We can. 
Michael Partridge, Vice President, Investor Relations 
Perfectly. 
Peter Mueller, Executive Vice President, Global Research and Development, 
and Chief Scientific Officer 
Good. So, we are very pleased with the progress we are making with our two key registration programs in HCV and 
CF. In HCV, our Phase 3 telaprevir registration program is advancing and we believe that the outcome of the trials will 
provide a best in class product profile for treatment- naïve and treatment-failure patient. We have reached several key 
milestones in the registration program, including completion of the telaprevir dosing portion in June. 
In our treatment-naïve trials ADVANCE and ILLUMINATE, all patients reached the 24-week time point in July. In the 
Phase 3 realized study, in treatment-failure patients, all patients have completed dosing of telaprevir and are now 
beyond week 20 of the study. We expect to have SVR24 data from ADVANCE and ILLUMINATE in the first half of 
2010 and from the realized study in mid-2010. 
The other thing the CNC means is chemistry, manufacturing and controls part of telaprevir development is in great 
shape. We have a fully integrated and cross validated supply chain in place today, which can manufacture telaprevir 
type product at commercial scale. All registration complaints are completed successfully and our validation complaints 
of telaprevir are on track and aligned with our commercial launch time line. J&J has also put in place an excellent 
supply chain to meet their territory needs, which also will provide a backup supply chain for us in North America. 
So in summary, we are on track to submit an NDA for telaprevir in the second half of 2010. We will have data from 
Phase 3 and we expect to have the CNC portion complete by that time. With the data we have already, we have begun 
to prepare the NDA documents and we will be working closely also with Tibotec in the months ahead, so that we can 
coordinate submissions in the U.S and the EU next year. 
I would like now to quickly update you on the status of Study C208, an exploratory study being run by Tibotec, 
evaluating twice daily dosing of telaprevir, compared to three times dosing – daily dosing. We announced today that an 
abstract representing Study C208 has been accepted as an oral presentation during the Presidential Plenary Session at 
the upcoming AASLD Conference on Tuesday, November 3 in Boston. 
We expect that SVR24 data from the study will be available for presentation. Based on the 12-week on treatment 
results announced last year, our confidence has been high for the potential to further develop and pursue twice-daily

dosing for telaprevir. We will work closely with our collaborators, Tibotec, who is conducting the study, and the 
regulatory authority to determine the right path forward for establishing this dosing regimen on the label for telaprevir. 
Turning elsewhere in our HCV portfolio, in addition to telaprevir, we are also focused on the evolution of HCV 
treatment towards STAT-C combination and specifically the combination of telaprevir, our lead protease inhibitor with 
VX-222, our lead HCV polymerase inhibitor. The combination of these compounds has the potential to further improve 
HCV therapy and enable treatment for a much broader group of HCV patients. 
Additionally, we are conducting a viral kinetic study of VX-222 to evaluate the antiviral activity and safety when dosed 
as a monotherapy. In this study, we are evaluating a broad range of doses of VX-222. We expect to complete this study 
in the third quarter. In the next few weeks, we will plan to initiate the first drug-drug interaction study with VX-222 
and telaprevir. With data from both of these drugs, we expect to start the first combination study of telaprevir and 
VX-222 in patients with HCV as early as the fourth quarter. 
As you all know, we have also a pipeline of additional novel HCV compounds and our goal here is with our current 
portfolio of additional HCV compounds to conduct clinical studies to identify compounds that are appropriate for 
further development, including combination therapy and to demonstrate how they can be clinically and commercially 
differentiated from other HCV products in development. Advancement of these programs will be data driven and we 
look forward to providing an update on these programs as appropriate. 
So now let's turn to our cystic fibrosis program. I want to start with VX-770, an oral drug candidate that targets the 
defective mutated CFTR protein, which is the result of an underlying genetic defect that causes cystic fibrosis, as you 
all know, an organ disorder. 
In the second quarter, we initiated the Phase 3 registration program for VX-770. The program consists of three separate 
trials, STRIVE, ENVISION, and DISCOVER, all of which have been designed to evaluate the utility of VX-770 across 
different age groups and genotypes, including children as young as six years of age. 
In the registration program, VX-770 will be dosed as a single tablet twice daily. STRIVE is our primary trial, 
evaluating 48 weeks of dosing in patients aged 12 and older who carry the G551D mutation on at least one allele. We 
will be measuring FEV1 at 24 weeks as the primary endpoint and at 48 weeks as the secondary endpoint to assess 
durability of any observed response, as well as to generate additional safety data to support the NDA submission. 
We will also be looking for increased CFTR activity with measurement, such as sweat chloride, which may provide a 
basis for understanding how VX-770 can change the underlying disease process. 
The ENVISION trial, albeit the second part, is a two-part study of VX-770 in children ages six to 11 who carry the 
G551D mutation. The selected dose of 100-milligram twice a day will be confirmed in a PK analysis in the first part of 
the trial and other than that, the study is very similar to the STRIVE study. If VX-770 can modify the course of this 
disorder, its benefits may be the greatest for young children who will retain more of their airway function. 
We now have multiple clinical sites set up and running for our STRIVE and ENVISION trials. We expect to complete 
enrollment in the STRIVE trial in the first quarter of 2010. We look very much forward to providing additional updates 
as appropriate as these studies progress. 
The DISCOVER trial is an exploratory trial, evaluating 16 weeks of dosing in patients aged 12 years and older who are 
homozygous for the F508del mutation. We are conducting this study for two primary reasons. First, to provide a fuller 
assessment of safety in CF patients, and secondly, to determine the potential for benefit in this population since 
F508del is the most common CF mutation. 
So now let's turn to the compound VX-809, our second compound targeting this organ disorder. VX-809 is an 
investigation of CFTR corrector compound. It's our hope that VX-809 might be able to broadly address the unmet need 
in CF by targeting the F508del mutation. 
We are currently running a Phase 2A trial of VX-809. So, this trial is primarily a safety study but it is also designed to 
assess the potential effect of VX-809 that it has on biomarkers of CFTR function, including sweat chloride and nasal

potential difference. VX-809 potential effect on the clinical endpoint FEV1 or lung function will also be measured. 
Any trend towards improvement that indicates that VX-809 could help to increase CFTR activity would be very 
encouraging for further development of VX-809 alone or in combination, obviously, with VX-770. 
We have contracted in vitro studies which have shown the potential to combine VX-770 and VX-809 together. Since 
VX-809 is designed to allow more functioning CFTR to get to the third surface than VX-770, the potential to help the 
CFTR to work better once it gets there, this approach potentially could further increase CFTR function in a large 
majority of CF patients. 
We believe that if our in vitro data showing the potential for the combination of VX-770 and 809 translates in the 
clinic, it could be positioned to enable the first evaluation of a VX-770 and VX-809 combination study in patients in 
the second half of 2010. 
Before I close, I'd like to highlight also data from our Phase 1 trial of our JAK compound VX-509. In this trial, VX-509 
was dosed at three ascending doses for 14 days in healthy volunteers. 
Our early data for JAK3 shows a promising safety profile and a profound dose-dependent and reversible reduction in 
PSTAT-5, a specific biomarker of JAK3 activity. VX-509 also showed a high degree of selective for JAK3 over JAK2 
in humans. This is very consistent with observations from our previous in vitro and preclinical in vivo studies. 
In vitro VX-509 has been shown to be greater than 1,000-fold more selective for JAK3, compared to non-JAK kinases 
and approximately 25 to 150-fold more selective for JAK3, compared to other JAK isotypes in cell-based assays. 
Taken together, this data show a highly selective JAK3 mechanism of action. The Phase 1 results support the current 
product profile for that stage of development and they also support moving ahead into a Phase 2 group of concept 
studies in rheumatoid arthritis. 
In summary, we believe that execution of our priority HCV and CF clinical programs have been very robust. By 
achieving critical milestones according to our set time lines, we continue on track to submit our NDA for telaprevir 
next year and establish a product profile of VX-770 and potentially its combinations with VX-809 for cystic fibrosis. 
I now turn the call over to Kurt. 
Kurt C. Graves, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer and Head, 
Strategic Development 
Thank you, Peter, and good evening, everyone. Tonight I'd like to make some brief remarks on our commercial 
preparations and business development activities and then move into our Q&A session. 
We are now more than halfway through the telaprevir Phase 3 registration program and commercially we are preparing 
for a successful launch. As you know, while there are a lot of commercial preparations ongoing, the most important 
thing you can do to secure a successful launch is deeply understand the market and deliver a highly valued and highly 
differentiated advance in therapy. 
Our clinical and commercial teams have worked closely together to do exactly that; that is understand what it will take 
to succeed in the marketplace and then develop telaprevir's profile for what we hope will be the leading ACV therapy 
for years to come. 
Through our extensive market research with patients, providers, and payers, we are preparing to deliver a product 
profile that aims not only to meet market needs, but also separate us from the competition, both short and long-term. 
In the short-term, our data from Phase 2 trials suggest: one, superior SVR rates versus current therapy in both treatment 
naive and all treatment failure subgroups; two, rapid viral responses, within four weeks that predict viral cures in 
patients treated for only six months versus today, 12 months of therapy; three, twice-daily dosing potential, which we'll 
learn more about at AASLD; and four, a well documented safety intolerability profile for a true triple therapy.

In the mid-term, we believe a major advance beyond what telaprevir is achieving as a protease inhibitor is based on the 
potential of combining two direct acting anti-virals, or what we call novel STAT-C combination regimens. 
With the right combination of two or three drugs, such as a protease like telaprevir, and a polymerase, like our VX-222, 
we believe there is a chance to produce a significantly improved regimen and we believe we are currently 
well-positioned to lead in that evolution in HCV treatment, should it happen. 
In summary for HCV, as we move to the final stages of our registration program and prepare to file and launch 
telaprevir, we're taking the key commercial steps needed to differentiate telaprevir during a launch period, while also 
focusing on the strategy to differentiate telaprevir in the mid-and long-term as well. 
We look forward to sharing upcoming clinical data around telaprevir, including twice-daily dosing data at AASLD, and 
then data from the first STAT-C proof-of-concept trials, which we are looking forward to initiate as early as the end of 
this year, with results as early as the first half of 2010. 
As Matt noted earlier, most investors look at Vertex through an HCV lens, and there are clearly good reasons to do so, 
given our leading STAT-C portfolio and the HCV market opportunity. But I would urge you to take a deeper look at 
our CF program, particularly our lead CF product candidate, VX-770. 
It's moving quickly and while still early from the perspective of how much data we have, it could prove to be a real 
source of value for Vertex in the not too distant future. Because we are targeting a devastating orphan disorder, with 
promising early data, the program has moved quickly into Phase 3 and we are putting teams in place to prepare for a 
potential approval and launch as a monotherapy and also, in potential combination with our second CF investigational 
compound, VX-809. 
Now a few comments on our recent business development announcement; as you know, we have been negotiating an 
amendment to our original telaprevir agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe in Japan and the Far East. The previous 
agreement, signed in 2004 when telaprevir was still preclinical, contemplated that Mitsubishi would focus on 
evaluation of telaprevir as a monotherapy through Phase 2 development. 
Given the successful progression of telaprevir in combination therapy that's happened since, the amended agreement 
now covers the development of telaprevir in combination with Peginterferon and ribavirin in Mitsubishi's territory. The 
key terms are as follows: we will receive a payment of 105 million following signing and up to an additional 65 million 
during the approval and initial launch period. This is in lieu of potential royalties under the original agreement that 
were calculated as a capped percentage of net sales minus our costs of supply to Mitsubishi. In addition, we will be 
transferring manufacturing rights to Mitsubishi Tanabe and they will be responsible for their own supply chain by the 
launch of their product in Japan. In summary, we believe the amendment captures value today, with additional value 
potential based on early commercial success. 
As you can see, our business development activities are playing a central role to providing capital to fund our business. 
With Mitsubishi now completed, we continue multiple business development opportunities, including the J&J 
milestone monetization and our out-licensing of our JAK3 inhibitor, VX-509 and VX-467. We will make choices on 
whether to pursue these opportunities based on the value we want to capture, our assessment of the future value of 
these assets relative to our current cash needs, and the financial strength of our business. 
In summary, in the first half of the year, we are very pleased with the advancements in our lead programs in HCV and 
CS and the commercial preparation for these markets, as well as the key business development activities that continue 
to provide value and fund our business in the near term. 
Michael, back to you. 
Michael Partridge, Vice President, Investor Relations 
Thanks, Kurt. We'd now like to open up the call to your questions.

Q&A 
Operator 
[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. Michael, if you have any closing remarks. 
<A - Michael Partridge, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Actually, there will be questions. There must be a 
technical difficulty on the line. Could you take a look please? 
Operator 
Yes, not a problem. Sorry about that, sir. 
<A - Michael Partridge, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Thank you. There will definitely be some questions. 
We'll just hold for a few moments. 
Operator 
Sorry about that, sir. Your first question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is 
open. 
[audio gap] 
<A - Robert Kauffman>: This is Bob Kaufmann. I'll try to answer that one. The study's ongoing at this point and 
we're continuing to evaluate the data. There's several dose groups being done and we're still in the midst of it. So, it's 
really premature to talk about what's happening there. 
<Q - Brian Abrahams>: When might we see that data? 
<A - Robert Kauffman>: That hasn't been decided at this point. Depends on when the study finishes and we normally 
reserve those kinds of disclosures to medical conference, so we'll be looking for a conference to present those data at a 
later time. 
<Q - Brian Abrahams>: Might you submitted it as a late breaker to AASLD? 
<A - - Ian Smith>: Brian, the key information from that data is to inform the STAT-C combination study that we 
expect to start towards the end of this year. If we're starting a STAT-C combination study, you should expect to see 
some disclosure around that dose ascending study around - towards end of this year. 
<Q - Brian Abrahams>: Terrific. That's very helpful. Thanks very much for taking the questions.

Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Bernstein. Your line is open. 
<Q - Geoff Porges>: Thanks for taking the question. Matt, welcome to the Vertex investor community. Before I ask 
you about your new job, would you mind if I ask you a few questions about your old job and company? I'm just 
kidding. 
On the JAK3 program, though, perhaps Peter, if he's still on the line, could let us know, was there any dose limiting 
toxicity seen in Phase 1? Were there any hematological or biochemical changes seen in that Phase 1? What dose did 
you see? And could you comment a little bit, Peter, about what sort of Phase 2 you're contemplating, kind of design,

and, Ian, maybe you could just give us the sense of what the costs might be if you were to embark on that yourselves? 
Thanks. 
<A - - Ian Smith>: Geoff - as Michael mentioned earlier in the call, Peter's actually in Germany, so the way we're 
arranging this is Bob Kaufmann is going to take most of the clinical questions today, so Bob can ably answer that 
question and then I'll follow-up. 
<Q - Geoff Porges>: Great, thanks. 
<A - Robert Kauffman>: So the studies that were done, as you know, were single and multiple dose ranging in 
healthy volunteers, with a very prominent biomarker component. I would say that in the dose range that we studied, the 
compound was very well tolerated. We really didn't observe any significant toxicities that would limit further 
development of the drug. I can't comment on the specifics of the safety profile, but I will just say that there was nothing 
there that certainly would prevent us from going forward, in any of the indications that we contemplate at this point. 
<A - Ian F. Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: And Geoff, to your question on costs, an 
interesting one, because cost of running this kind of study we're thinking about could be around $15 million spread 
over a period of running that study. The challenge for us is as we look around collaborations and collecting value from 
out-licensing the drug versus the cost to run the study, and then we measure that against the broad financial profile of 
the company. So, it would be about $15 million to run a proof of concept study. 
<Q - Geoff Porges>: Perfect. Thanks very much, Ian. 
Operator 
Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan. Your line is open. 
<A - Michael Partridge, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Geoff, are you there? 
<Q - Geoffrey Meacham>: Can you hear me? 
<A - Michael Partridge, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes. 
<A - Matthew W. Emmens, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. 
<Q - Geoffrey Porges>: Okay. So, question for you on 770, based on what you know, what you guys know today, is 
there any reason to think that you could see lower FEV1 or maybe a different AE profile at 48 weeks versus the 24 
week study? 
<A - Robert Kauffman>: This is Bob. There's no reason to think that most compounds and most drug that are 
tolerated at 24 weeks usually maintain that tolerability profile. Clearly, as you know, we're early in the program. We 
don't have a large amount of long term data, so we'll have to see, but at this point we have no reason to think there 
would be any drop-off in tolerability over that timeframe. 
<Q - Geoffrey Porges>: Just thinking commercially, how long would you envision the duration of therapy potentially 
to be? 
<A - Robert Kauffman>: We believe it would be life-long. 
<Q - Geoffrey Porges>: Great. Okay. And then follow-up for you on the HCV side, for 222, can you talk about how 
many doses you're actually testing and maybe just any preliminary cut about maybe the design of the combo trial with 
telaprevir. 
<A - Robert Kauffman>: We're examining a number of doses of 222 and I think when we get ready to report the 
results, we can be more forthcoming about both the doses that we've used and what we've seen. I'm sorry, your second 
part of your question?

<Q - Geoffrey Porges>: Just anything you can tell us how you're at least thinking about the initial design of the combo 
trial of 222 with telaprevir. 
<A - Robert Kauffman>: Yes. You know, I think that'll depend a little bit on what we see with the data from 222. We 
certainly envision a combination sort of dose ranging trial. The telaprevir dose that we're using currently clinically is 
likely to be fixed and we'll probably vary the 222 dose around it. But how many doses we would study I think very 
much depends on just on what we see and we're not quite there yet.

Operator 
Your next question comes from the line of Ed Tenthoff with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. 
<Q - Edward Tenthoff>: Great, thank you very much. And I applaud your efforts to pull forward the cash to close the 
gap towards telaprevir launch. Can you give us any update on how the possible sale of the European milestones are 
going? 
<A - Ian F. Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: So we're in the midst of that process, 
Ed. We did disclose that we initiated the process a couple weeks ago, really from a point of – if we're talking about 
such a significant transaction that from a Reg FD perspective, we did have to let the investor base know as well. 
It is still ongoing. We expect to conclude the process shortly. At this point, I don't want to talk about value. There's 
been much debate, as I'm sure many that are on the line today, much debate as what the right value is. What I would 
say, though, is it is the way that we measure the value, which is we'll look at the capital it provides to the business 
today and when adding that capital to the business today, what does it allow us to do in terms of the position of our 
business, the R&D position of our business? 
So we'll evaluate it in that sense. As you can tell, right now the business is going along nicely. We want to defer any 
need to access the capital markets, and therefore, we're bringing cash to the business development activities, as Kurt 
mentioned, and we're going to take a close look at the value from the milestones to see whether it can continue to help 
us keep certain assets within the business, and we'll make that choice in the future. 
<Q - Edward Tenthoff>: Okay, that's very helpful. And just as a quick follow-up, does this number and potential 
business development opportunity get you to the point where you could get to launch without raising additional capital, 
or how does that all factor out in your view? 
<A - Ian F. Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: So step by step - I appreciate the focus 
on the capital structure, but it's step by step right now. And on the call, I have already provided guidance that with the 
completed transaction with Mitsubishi, we should end the year within excess of $700 million of cash. 
The way that I first want to measure is to say how much capital can we raise from a milestone monetization that would 
add to that position. I think when we add that cash onto the ending position at the end of the year, I think we'll be in 
better position to answer the question: does that fund us through to cash flow positive? 
So step by step, and right now it's about taking a strong balance sheet into 2010, and we'll evaluate the, let's say the 
value of the transaction versus the value of the breadth of the financial strength of the business as we go into 2010. 
<Q - Edward Tenthoff>: Great, excellent. Good luck.

<Q - - Phil Nadeau>: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one's on manufacturing. You 
mentioned in the prepared remarks that you have a supply chain up and running. And as I'm sure you're aware, there are 
some very aggressive analyst estimates out there for the launch of telaprevir that include multibillion dollars of sales 
within the first couple years of launch. What type of manufacturing capacity will you have at the time of launch, and is 
there any risk that you wouldn't be able to supply the market if some of the more optimistic projections come true? 
<A - Ian F. Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: So I'll take the initial part of that 
question and maybe Peter will add to it. But broadly, we have our own internal forecasts, and as we work closely with 
our suppliers, we're building to ensure that we're in adequate position to support that demand. The way that we're 
building the supply chain though, is also to provide buffer in terms of whether it's an upside or a downside case, 
compared to our internal forecasting. 
And what I mean, by that is the way that Peter, and Peter is responsible for the supply chain, but the way Peter and his 
team are building the supply chain is to build and stockpile the raw material. 
Why that is important is the raw material actually has a very long shelf life, and it's also important because we can 
convert raw material to finished product very quickly. So, what it allows you to do is to build buffer in your supply, and 
then access, the raw material based on the demand when you get closer to the time. But we'll be well-positioned when 
we come to launch. 
<Q - - Phil Nadeau>: Okay. And on the raw materials side, is there any raw material that's particularly hard to get, 
anything that we should pay attention to as we kind of assess your ability to build inventory? 
<A - Ian F. Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Peter and his team have put a great 
supply chain in place that's fully outsourced. We've avoided that sometimes massive investment that's required to build 
your own manufacturing facilities. It starts in China, comes through Europe, and ends up in the U.S. and we're in very 
good shape and we have access and been supplied all of the profits that we require. 
<A - - Peter Mueller>: So Ian, maybe one comment in addition to all of that; you are a good manufacturing guy now. 
If we have for each and every intermediate step, raw materials and other credentials that have to go into the 
formulation, primary suppliers and pick up suppliers, so there's no shortage in supply anticipated, as we go forward. 
<Q - - Phil Nadeau>: Okay, and - 
<A - - Peter Mueller>: And all of them are validated and basically have FDA certificates. 
<Q - - Phil Nadeau>: Okay. And maybe a question for Kurt along the lines of the launch, it seems like there's 
increasing controversy building on how much capacity there is within the medical community for retreating or bringing 
new patients back to go on telaprevir. I'm sure you've done a lot of work along those lines. Could you share some of 
that with us? How much could, how many more patients could be treated upon the launch of telaprevir than are treated 
today? 
<A - - Kurt Graves>: Yes, it's a good question. And thanks for asking it. We've gotten this from a number of people 
over the last few months. And I think there's a couple ways I can try and give you a simple answer to it. Number one is 
the number of patients that are getting treated on average today this year and going forward, is probably in the range of 
60 to 70,000 HCV patients. You should contrast that to the peak patient treatment years of mid-2000s where patients 
were getting treated up to 140 to 150,000 patients per year. So, we already know one simple thing. If you double the 
current market capacity, that's already been done in the past. 
The other thing we've done in an office by office, or practice by practice level is try to project how many patients are 
currently in that practice, and how many new patients can come in. And we've looked at the highest-volume prescribing 
practices to understand what they do to manage capacity. And the big difference we found there is that the number of 
nurses or physicians' assistants in that practice is what really enables more volume in terms of numbers of patients 
treated.

And we hear from all the people that we've done extensive research with that there's not going to be a capacity issue. 
Maybe with the very top, top KOLs they might need to add one or two more NPAs if things really take off like 
gangbusters in the launch. But we don't see any major barriers or capacity issues in all the work that we've done. 
<Q - - Phil Nadeau>: Okay, great and just one final question on the drug-drug interaction study. Have you done 
preclinical drug-drug interaction studies to see if there's any preliminary signs of danger, and if so, what have been the 
results? 
<A - Robert Kauffman>: We haven't done those studies. This is Bob. We haven't done those studies. We've just based 
on our assessment on the various - metabolism of the two drugs, which is how one normally does it, animal DDI 
studies generally don't really help all that much. So, we really feel quite confident in our choice of the doses and the 
design of that trial based on the metabolism data. 
<Q - - Phil Nadeau>: Okay, great. 
<A - - Kurt Graves>: Just add on to what Bob said there, the metabolism profiles of both of these drugs are very 
different. So, we're not going into this trial really concerned about drug-drug interactions. We're just doing it to be extra 
safe. But based on the metabolism profiles of 222 and telaprevir, we wouldn't expect to see drug-drug interactions.

Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Citi. Your line is open. 
<Q - Yaron Werber>: Thank you for taking my question. Ian, just a question for you, the JAK3 compound could be 
pretty interesting and it sounds like you're obviously building a pretty big cash position and I mean, we could have even 
gotten to profitability without raising further cash, assuming, let's say, that the R&D spend next year – let's say total 
expenses remained pretty flattish from this year, i.e., R&D comes down, SG&A comes up. I'm trying to understand, is 
there a scenario by which you'll actually keep the JAK3 and develop it yourself, assuming you can monetize the 
European royalties and the milestones? 
And then second question is just help us understand, the 105 million payment that you will get from Mitsubishi in Q3, 
how do you – do you amortize it through the revenue line, or is it a one-time sale? Thanks. 
<A - Ian F. Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Let me – thanks, Yaron, for the 
question. Let me first deal with the easy question, which is the amortization of revenue. So, that's just a GAAP 
accounting answer, which is we amortize that upfront payment over a period of continued involvement with our 
partner. So, that will be over a number of years. 
As far as the question of could we keep the JAK compound as opposed to out-licensing? It's hard. Matt came into the 
business and - a few months ago and his first question to us was - this looks a great compound. Why are you guys 
out-licensing it? And then Kurt's out there and he's generating great value with the discussions that we have with the 
pharma company. And then you've got the third prong, which is I'm out there seeing whether we want to monetize 
milestones. 
So what we've got to do is we've got to pull those components together. There's great value in R&D of this kind of 
compound, with this kind of profile; we're very excited about it. Kurt can generate value-based off that. And I'm trying

to see whether we can create kind of a capital structure and a cash position that allows us actually to get everybody 
happy, which is Matt gets to keep the drug and Kurt actually has a reason to say no from an out-licensing, and I get to 
say we have adequate capital to run this business and take on those R&D opportunities, which is what we're in business 
for. 
So is there a scenario that we keep the JAK compound? Yeah. I think there is. We have to look into the future, though, 
and continue down the tracks that we are doing. And see how much capital we can raise from the milestones and see 
what the value could be from an out-licensing of JAK, and I think we're going to get some good visibility on that in the 
very near future. But clearly we're in business to create drugs and the JAK compound is a very exciting compound. 
Operator 
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Aberman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. 
<Q - Michael Aberman>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I suppose I have a similar question on the 
amortization, but it's more on the guidance. Obviously, the net income in the first half was much higher than half of 
what your guidance is. 
And I'm wondering if you can help us understand how we should be thinking about your potential next milestone, let's 
say an upfront payment on JAK3, for example, as part of included in that guidance. And so is it a revenue driver that 
brings down that net loss per quarter in the second half, or should we be thinking about it more on the expense side? 
<A - Ian F. Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: So great question. Thanks, Michael. So, 
the guidance we provided on the call, I'll just state that again, which is a pro forma net loss, or a non-GAAP net loss, 
sorry, between 400 and 435, and specifically it is, depending on doing future out-licensing activities. And the reason for 
that is, because if we out-license a compound, such as JAK, and we provide worldwide rights to a partner, because we 
don't have continued involvement other than to collect it in the future, you actually get to record all of that as revenue. 
So clearly, that would have a big impact on our revenue line, very different than the Mitsubishi program, which you 
have to spread because of our continued involvement in rights that we own of telaprevir. 
So an out-licensing program around the JAK compound would be a significant contribution, and also, as we provide the 
guidance, the guidance is pending out-licensing activities. The interesting thing of all of this is when you look at the 
milestones, if we choose to monetize milestones, it would provide cash flow to our business, but that doesn't hit us you 
know. 
So the guidance, to be clear, is 400 to 435 subject to future out-licensing activities, and the year-end cash position is 
approximately $700 million, and if we do further business development activities, such as out-licensing, or the 
monetization of milestones, we should be above $700 million. We'd add to that position. 
<Q - Michael Aberman>: And if I can also follow up on the JAK3, does that – what about keeping some rights? I 
mean, you obviously have U.S. rights. You've retained U.S. rights for telaprevir. Are you thinking at all of a worldwide 
deal for JAK3, or might you try to, again, maintain some rights to future development for JAK3? And does that change 
how you would amortize a deal? 
<A - Kurt C. Graves, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer and Head, Strategic Development>: 
This is Kurt. I'll make a couple comments on this just to pick up on what Ian was saying. As it relates to a potential 
partnership around JAK, what we'd be looking for in any collaboration is a really qualified company that is a potential 
worldwide collaboration. Obviously, that's the way to best achieve the maximum value for the asset. And all the parties 
we've been talking about are global players, many of them with deep category experience and drug development 
knowledge in this area. 
As you can tell from what Ian said, and what Matt said earlier, it's a very interesting, ongoing debate in the business, 
because we need to maintain our strong financial position and Ian's very clear about that. But we see great value in the 
JAK compound. And I'd just like to add that eventually, we'll probably need to have a partner on JAK. The question is

on what exact point in time and on what kinds of terms? 
But once we get to PAC and we move into full development, this is a program that could have up to six or seven 
different indications. And while we're doing HCV and CF, we're going to need a partner to move fast enough in parallel 
on multiple indications to really realize the maximum value of this. 
What we're doing internally right now is figuring out the best time to do this deal, with the right partner and on the right 
terms. And that's where we're at right now. There's high interest in the asset. I think our discussions with partners is 
only emboldened us on just how attractive this asset is, once we saw Pfizer's efficacy data. And when you look at our 
Phase 1 package, we have a Phase 2 asset that could really be differentiated. And we want to make sure we select the 
right partner, if and when we do one, and that we do it on terms that maximize the value to us. 
Your last question was, would we potentially keep some rights to that, or territory rights? It's certainly one of the things 
on our mind, and one of the things we're discussing with some of the partners. 
<Q - Michael Aberman>: Before I get back in the queue, if I could just – I hope this wasn't asked already. But in 
terms of the BID, can you help us understand, it sounds like you're all very optimistic about the potential there. I'm 
wondering, have you had any discussions with the FDA or how comfortable would you feel about a pathway to get 
BID - how quickly after launch can you get BID either, a) on the label, or b) as an option for physicians? And what do 
you think needs to get done after this trial? 
<A - Kurt C. Graves, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer and Head, Strategic Development>: 
It's Kurt again. It's a good question. Obviously, from a commercial perspective, we want to get BID on the label as soon 
as we can, and that's clearly our goal. We're still going to have to have discussions with both U.S. and Tibotec will be 
having discussions with European regulatory authorities about the best way to do that. There are a few different 
scenarios where we'll be discussing with health authorities about exactly how we can do that. 
The worst case scenario is that we have do a Phase 3 trial, a non-inferiority type design, but that's the worst case, the 
longest timeframe for us to do that, which would be within a couple years of probably launch. But there are scenarios 
and options that we've developed to have those discussions with health authorities and we're just not all the way 
through those yet. So, we'll keep you updated as those discussions progress. 
<Q - Michael Aberman>: And I'll get back in the queue. I appreciate the questions. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Liisa Bayko with JMP Securities. Your line is open. 
<Q - Liisa Bayko>: Just one quick question. As we look to next year and your commercial ramp, can you maybe talk 
about when you'll be starting to build your commercial infrastructure in terms of bringing the sales people on? Will it 
be prior to launch? Are you going to wait until you're actually approved, and ready to launch before bringing them on? 
How should we think about the build for next year? Thanks. 
<A - Kurt C. Graves, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer and Head, Strategic Development>: 
Liisa, it's Kurt. It's a good question. In terms of ramp, since this is obviously a very important launch for us, and our 
first launch as a company, one of the things that you want to make sure you do when you launch a drug is have some 
relationship with key customers prior to the day that the drug is actually approved and you show up on your doorway. 
How long that is before launch is a discussion we're having internally, but what I could guide you on is that we will be 
looking to establish a relationship with our most important customers in advance of that launch period. And subject to 
all the other financial comments Ian made, we need to do that in a way that makes sense financially for the business. 
<Q - Liisa Bayko>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Tom Russo with Baird Company. Your line is open. 
<Q - Thomas Russo>: Most of my big picture strategic questions have been asked. Just returning to 222, in that trial, 
is there also a part B looking at triple combo? And if so, how many weeks would triple combo be studied? And when 
might we see data from that? 
<A - Kurt C. Graves, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer and Head, Strategic Development>: 
So it's a good question that you're asking, but let me try and back up a little bit. What we're doing right now is we're 
identifying the best doses to take forward in a STAT-C combination trial. When we identify those doses, and hopefully 
in the third quarter of this year and move into our first combination trials, our goal at a high level, if I can capture it for 
you that way, is to start to identify dual and triple therapy regimens. That is the goal of the next phase of our proof of 
concept work when we first start our STAT-C combination trials and it will be regimens that do explore potentially a 
dual therapy of telaprevir and 222 alone, and the two triple therapy regimens: 222, telaprevir and ribavirin and/or 222 
telaprevir and interferon. 
<Q - Thomas Russo>: Okay. And Kurt, I think I ask you this every couple of quarters, but since you've been out doing 
more market research, what is the current thinking on pricing? And I know, you know, you look at the cost per cure. Is 
that at this point in the effort, is it focused more on naives, or are you talking to payers about cost per cure in failures? 
Can you give us a flavor for where that stands? 
<A - Kurt C. Graves, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer and Head, Strategic Development>: 
Yeah, we're, a doing a lot of market research. But to answer your question directly, we're looking at the value 
proposition of the drug in the context of what telaprevir can do in terms of curing a lot more patients than what the 
healthcare system is paying now or will pay in the future. So, we're doing a lot of health economics and outcomes 
research right now to establish the burden of this disease to payers. You might want to look at a study we just put out 
recently called the Milliman Report. That will give you a perspective of how we're looking at it from an outcome and 
value-based perspective. 
I would say that the cost per cure analysis is only one of the points of analysis that we'll talk to payers about, we'll also 
talk about the burden to the broader healthcare system when establishing our value proposition and ultimately then 
setting our price. Thanks for the question. 
<Q - Thomas Russo>: Thanks. 
Operator 
Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kolbert with ThinkEquity. Your line is open. 
<Q - Jason Kolbert>: Hi, same question for Kurt, just a little bit of a different spin. Given the burden that new 
STAT-C therapies are likely to place on the government and private insurers, what negotiations, what plans are in place 
in advance in terms of strategies to understand what reimbursement might look like? 
<A - Kurt C. Graves, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer and Head, Strategic Development>: 
So the biggest thing before we go out and talk to payers, which medical and health economic experts can do and 
through various publications that we plan between now and the period of launch are really focused on what I was 
saying earlier. To educate payers on what the current cost of the healthcare system right now are of HCV patients, 
which are pretty sizable and significant. 
But more importantly, we're doing a lot of modeling to identify the burden of this disease and the cost to payers, if they 
didn't intervene with a higher curative therapy like telaprevir and interferon or ribavirin because this disease is now 
where patients have had the disease for 25, up to 30 years for some of them, the costs are going to exponentially

increase over the next decade. That education is the most important thing that we can be doing before we then go out 
and talk to them close to launch, what our price is, and how reimbursement will happen. 
<Q - Jason Kolbert>: So can I ask you a little bit of a different twist on the same question, which is assuming that 
VCH-222 and a combination adds value, it increases SVR, it shortens duration of therapy, but in terms of costs, you 
know, can you double the cost for an incremental increase in SVR if, you know, a year or two years after TVR 
launches you've got a combination product? 
<A - Kurt C. Graves, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer and Head, Strategic Development>: 
That's a great question and one we spend a lot of time speculating on and planning scenarios around internally right 
now. I think one of the key things it comes down to, going back to the earlier questions on our trial design is will 
telaprevir and 222, assuming success, will it be a dual regimen, where we get rid of interferon or ribavirin. In that 
scenario, I think it will be a great value proposition and give us a lot of pricing leverage because right now there's a 
sizable piece of the market that can't even take and won't take interferon. 
So, depending on what our regimen looks like, I think there's a lot of value for an oral or even a triple therapy STAT-C 
combination regimen. So, we're not too worried about having the pricing leverage. If we get cure rates up into the 
mid-80s, high 80s, I think you've got a great proposition. And if you get rid of interferon or ribavirin, you've got an 
awesome value proposition to the healthcare system. 
<Q - Jason Kolbert>: Yeah. That's the Holy Grail in Hep C, absolutely. So, last question would be do you have any 
idea what you think it will take in terms of a head count and sales reps to reach the U.S. market? 
<A - Kurt C. Graves, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer and Head, Strategic Development>: 
In terms of sales reps, which are, you know, one component of your commercial model, there's other customers we 
have to deal with, too, but if you just take it down to a sales rep view of the commercial model, it's in the range of 100 
to 150. It's very, very small. This is a very targeted market. You're talking about 4,000 physicians and, you know, 2,000 
to 2,500 group practices. So, it's, it's very concentrated and given the low marketing and sales investment versus a lot of 
other diseases and the price we can leverage on this, it's a very attractive business for us. 
<Q - Jason Kolbert>: Okay, thank you very much; very exciting time, particularly for HCV patients. 
<A - Kurt C. Graves, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer and Head, Strategic Development>: 
Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of David Bu with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
<Q - - David Bu>: Thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk to CF actually. So, first, on 
the patients and the trials that you have going on, do you - is this - is this a disease that you actually need to get at the 
patients before there's longer term damage or fibrosis or anything else in the lung, and can you hit some of the older or 
more severe patients with these compounds? 
<A - Robert Kauffman>: This is Bob. I'll answer that question. In the data we've presented so far, those are in patients 
who already have a substantial amount of lung damage and we've been able to show benefit in terms of FEV1 in the 
short-term and that's obviously what we're attempting to confirm in the pivotal program. But as you can imagine, you 
would likely gain greater benefit by treating patients before they develop significant lung damage. 
And our program is really designed to kind of March down the age range. We're down to 6 year-olds in our current 
studies. The PK data, safety data we developed there will allow us to kind of get down into, we hope infancy. And the 
ultimate goal I think is to begin to treat patients as early as possible. So, we certainly agree with you that the benefit 
may well be greater in that group. We'll obviously have to see what happens, but we're pretty optimistic that we can 
really make a difference in the natural history of the disease by treating patients that early.

<Q - - David Bu>: And with regard to the, to that question, is there any difference between the corrector or the 
potentiator. Would you anticipate there to be any difference between the corrector and the anticipator or the 
potentiator? 
<A - Robert Kauffman>: I guess our assumption, which is logical, is that improvement in the CFCR function is what 
results in all the other benefits, as long as the corrector and potentiator improved CFTR function, we would expect the 
same benefits to accrue. So, I think that's really what the basis for that program will be, but that's what our expectation 
is. I think any improvement in CFTR function is going to translate into clinical benefit. 
<Q - - David Bu>: Great. And then finally, probably getting ahead of ourselves a little bit, but in terms of the 
commercial landscape, I was wondering if - again, it seems like this would be a pretty concentrated market and I was 
wondering if you could talk about the physicians and the patients and what the market dynamics look like. 
<A - Kurt C. Graves, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer and Head, Strategic Development>: 
Yes, this is Kurt. This is obviously an orphan disorder and from a concentration point of view, it's one of the most 
concentrated markets I've seen. You're talking both U.S. and Europe having to have a sales force of probably no more 
than 40 to 50 reps to cover the offices. So, it's a market where from a patient point of view, there's not a lot of market 
development activity, at least in the developed world. 
European countries and the U.S., diagnosis is done very well and upwards of 85 to 90% plus of patients are diagnosed 
in the system, followed very closely by their prescribers, so you're not doing a lot of market development, market 
expansion activities. A lot different from say, HCV, where a lot of the market still has to be diagnosed and developed. 
<Q - - David Bu>: All right, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Lazard Capital Markets. Your line is open. 
<Q - Terence Flynn>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just on the monetization of the telaprevir e-milestones, I was 
wondering if you guys approached J&J first and what they might have said about any potential deal. 
<A - Ian F. Smith, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Thanks for the question. We considered 
all possible avenues and we continue to consider all possible avenues. As we've looked at the milestone – the 
monetization of these milestones, these are milestones that relate to the filing and launch in Europe and potentially 
reach out as far as 2012. We've looked at this as a financial transaction and if we can capture value from whichever the 
channel it is, we will maximize that value. 
<Q - Terence Flynn>: Okay, and then just a second question. I noticed you guys will have some one-year durability 
data on SVR from the PROVE 3 trial. Just wondering looking at the historical literature for peg/ribavirin treatment in 
treatment experienced patients, what's the percentage of patients that have a late relapse in the different subsets of 
treatment experienced patients? Can you guys give me a sense of just historical data there for peg/riba? Thanks. 
<A - Robert Kauffman>: This is Bob. I'm not actually aware of any published or even anecdotal data on the various 
subgroups of treatment experienced patients. This is just an area that has really expanded a lot with the development of 
STAT-C combination treatments with peg and ribavirin. So, there's nothing to say. 
We do know that for naive patients and not sure it would be really any different for treatment failure patients - the rate 
of relapse beyond week 24 is extremely low, probably in the 1% per year level, and many of those may actually be 
re-infections as opposed to relapses, and in many cases they've been proven to be re-infections. So, it's extremely small. 
We wouldn't expect it to be any higher. 
<Q - Terence Flynn>: Okay, thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Thomas Weisel. Your line is open. 
<Q - Ian Somaiya>: Thanks. I apologize if you've already answered these questions. I jumped on a little late. But 
you've been fairly clear on the timing of the Phase 3 data for telaprevir. I was just hoping if you could walk us through 
a time course of either actions or events to help culminate in the actual regulatory filing for telaprevir and then I just 
have one follow-up question. 
<A - Robert Kauffman>: This is Bob. I guess I can speak to that. I mean, our time line is the second half of '10 and 
we'll be analyzing data and putting summaries together and all of that during the time between the time we have the 
data in the first half of '10, mid-'10 till the second half, so - 
<Q - Ian Somaiya>: I was maybe hoping - 
<A - Robert Kauffman>: – don't know what else to say - 
<Q - Ian Somaiya>: I was hoping for more specific than when do you anticipate putting together manufacturing 
portion submission or what's already been done, what's rate limiting step, is it simply the clinical section that's - that 
you're waiting on to be able to file the application? 
<A - Robert Kauffman>: Normally, clinical is on the rate limiting step to filing and that will be the case here as well. 
There are certainly summaries that can be written or already being written. For example, the non-clinical summaries or 
the manufacturing summaries and clinical pharmacology pieces are already in process. 
Those will expand as we get the additional data and in reality, though, as you're aware, the largest bit of the data that 
really goes into the filing will come out of the Phase 3 program, which is of course, the last thing we'll get. We are 
certainly in advance writing absolutely everything that we possibly can. 
<Q - Ian Somaiya>: Just as the one follow-up, one other question was on the PROVE 3, I believe I read the press 
release correctly, you submitted the data from the trial to the FDA. Just curious -what the intent of the submission was 
or the FDA requested it, just trying to get a better understanding of that. 
<A - Robert Kauffman>: – Bob, we inform the FDA of all key data in the program as it comes in to make them aware 
of what we're seeing both on the safety, obviously, and the efficacy side. Other than that, I really can't comment any 
further on the responses, but we certainly sent it in. 
<Q - Ian Somaiya>: Okay. Thank you.

Your last question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Bernstein. Your line is open. 
<Q - Geoff Porges>: Thank you very much for giving me a chance to ask a follow-up. Just on VX-770, Bob perhaps 
you could give some sense of how long you think the DISCOVER trial will take to enroll. Is it possible that you'll have 
the results for that study before you have the results from the other Phase 3s? I am just trying to get a sense of when we 
might get a real glimpse of either the breadth or the real utility of 770 from one of these longer trials. 
<A - Robert Kauffman>: We're sequencing the start of the three trials that we've been talking about. In that 
population, obviously it's a little larger population, but given the way these are being sequenced, I would – we don't 
have really firm dates yet because we're still early in the enrollment period. But I anticipate that all of the data will 
come in at around the same time, perhaps a little bit shorter for the trial you mentioned just because the treatment 
duration is a bit less. As to what we would disclose about that, I think we'd have to do that later as we get closer to 
when that might happen. 
<Q - Geoff Porges>: Bob, when do you think that might be then? When does that renewal mind of all the -

<A - Robert Kauffman>: I think it would be best to put off the answer to that question until we actually get some 
amount of enrollment under our belts and we get a better sense of how it's going. 
<Q - Geoff Porges>: Okay. 
<A - Robert Kauffman>: I'm sure we'll give you some information about that at a later time. 
<A - Kurt C. Graves, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer and Head, Strategic Development>: 
Geoff, this is Kurt, too. Just to complement what Bob said because your core question was around the breadth and 
clinical utility of 770. You should know that there's a registration program that we always talk to you about with the 
study that were outlined in our press release, but we also will do other non-registration work to explore the clinical 
utility of this drug, probably before launch and other mutations. 
So the data that will come out on 770 is, yes, going to come from our registration programs, but there could be other 
proof of concept trials and other mutations, for example, that will come out prior to launch as well, because we know 
the medical community and certain parents and patients with CF will want to know what the breadth of the clinical 
utility of 770 is and we want to be in a position to provide as much information about that when we launch the product 
as possible. 
<Q - Geoff Porges>: Thanks very much.
