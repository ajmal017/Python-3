MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION 

Marta Nichols 

Financial Measures 

On today’s call we’ll also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about the company’s performance 

These may include total expenses less traffic acquisition costs, or TAC, and total expenses less TAC, depreciation and 
amortization and stock-based compensation expense 

Reconciliations of those non-GAAP measures to the GAAP measures we consider most comparable can be found on 
our corporate website, info.yahoo.com, under Investor Relations 

Carol Bartz 

Q2 Review 

So let’s start with Q2 

We continued to deliver on our promise to improve operating income and margins but we were on the low end of our 
revenue guidance 

We saw operating margins expand more than 600BPS to 11% y-over-y, and excluding restructuring charges in 2009 
and ‘10, income from operations grew 32% 

FX and Search 


• 
So we did great on operations and controlling expenses, but why did we hit the low end of the revenues? 
• 
Well, it’s a combination of factors 
• 
Of course, one is FX, but the majority of the story is split evenly between the search and display marketplaces 
• 
With regard to Search, we gained share in the quarter but we didn’t monetize searches as much as we expected 
Display Side 

• 
On the Display side, with our Owned and Operated sites, we saw healthy ad spending of 19%, but the second 
week of June we saw demand slow down as a handful of big advertisers pulled back 
• 
There was also no last-minute spot market this quarter 
• 
We believe it was due to quarterly expense management for their companies 
• 
The first three weeks in July indicate we’re back to normal 
• 
In June, we attended the world’s largest ad conference, where we had numerous conversations with advertisers 
and did not get the sense of a persistent problem 
Revenue and Operating Margin 

• 
Before we turn the call over to Tim to discuss the quarter in detail, I’d like to answer a question that most of you 
asked me: 
• 
How do we measure our business? 
• 
Obviously, we watch revenue and operating margin very closely; those are our most important metrics 
• 
We also have many internal metrics that we use to run our business, and, of course, we track third-party reports 
• 
While there’s no one metric that captures everything, we concern ourselves most with users and their engagement 
on our network 
• 
This includes how engaged there are users around our communication and social products, like Mail, 
Messenger, Flickr and Answers 
• 
How engaged are they with Search, and how engaged are they with our rich and varied content sites? 
Engagement Efforts 

So let me talk a bit about what we’re doing to drive engagement 

On the content side, having great content that’s real-time, interesting and entertaining is one thing, but that’s not 
enough to ensure engagement 
Users today want to go beyond words presented on the screen 

• 
They want videos 
• 
They want to interact 
• 
They want a social aspect 
• They want it anywhere, anytime, on any device; and they want it very personally relevant and local 
These are the four Os I talked about at Investor Day: 

• 
Video 
• 
Social 
• 
Mobile 
• 
And Local 
Acquisition of Associated Content 

• 
The big content move we made in Q2 was our acquisition of Associated Content 
• 
Their crowd sourced approach, with 380,000 contributors, rounds out our content strategy 
• 
We now have an incredible resource to tap that extends our ability to provide high-quality, personally relevant 
content to our users and advertisers 
• 
Meanwhile, we also continue to make investments in our existing content and media sites 
• 
At Yahoo! News, we’ll focus on building out a voice and identity for the site, much like we’ve done for Sports 
• 
We’ve recently established a Politics & Opinion team in Washington, D.C. and since then, we’ve seen 
click-through rates increase up to 50% on political content 
• 
And In early July, we launched The Upshot 
• 
The broad focus is on politics, the media and breaking news 
• 
The team behind it uses their incredible reporting skills, as well as analysis of what’s trending on Yahoo!, to 
deliver content that’s designed to be relevant for our audience 
• 
What’s great about both Associated Content and new products like The Upshot is how we use Yahoo!’s unique 
strengths 
• 
We’re pairing editorial expertise with a huge treasure trove of data on Yahoo! about users, their interests and 
their intent, to deliver content that we know they want and will respond to 
Platforms Build Out 

• 
We also continue to build out our platforms that enable us to quickly and effectively launch new properties 
around the globe 
• 
For instance, we recently launched our Lifestyle site in the UK 
• 
In its first five days, five days, the site garnered 7.8mm page views and 2mm uniques; and after just two weeks, 
it’s landed in the top ten lifestyle sites for the country 
• 
I ask you, what other website besides Yahoo! could have such an impact in such a short amount of time? 
• 
We have plans to roll out similar sites, even the same platform, to France, Germany, Italy and Spain in Q3 
• 
And look for us to follow this model in LatAm and Asia as well 
Content Vehicle 

Social 


• 
Now let’s talk about those four Os 
• 
First up is Social 
• 
One of the levers we’re using to create engagement and distribute our great content is through social channels 
• 
Our acquisition of Citizen Sports is beginning to pay off in this area 
• 
We’ve already signed a number of multimillion dollar joint partnerships with major consumer-facing brands 
Fantasy Football 

• 
Fantasy football is big business, and this season users will be able to Lite their own fantasy team on Yahoo! 
and receive personalized updates about players, injuries and advice delivered directly to their Newsfeed on 
Facebook and the Yahoo! Updates, all sponsored by Miller Lite 
• 
College football passions run deep 
• 
This season, users on Yahoo! will be able to pick who they believe is going to win and broadcast it and 
debate it with their friends on Facebook, sponsored by Southwest Airlines 
• 
Big brands love these unique social campaigns that allow users to engage more deeply with Yahoo! content 
and interact with friends and advertisers 
Facebook 

• 
Speaking of Facebook, we deepened our integration with them in a big way this past quarter 
• 
Now users who are on both Yahoo! and Facebook can link their accounts to view and share updates with 
friends across both networks 
• 
We call this new level of social integration Yahoo! Pulse 
• 
It’s still in early innings, but so far we’re encouraged by what we’re seeing 
• 
The good news is users who connect their Facebook accounts with Yahoo! view more pages and spend more 
time on our network 
• 
Social games are also a big engagement draw and it’s why we announced our recent partnership with Zynga 
• 
Starting in August, we’ll integrate Yahoo! IDs with Zynga and publish updates into Yahoo! and notifications 
into Yahoo! Mail 
• 
Then, in Q4, we expect to begin hosting hit games, like Farmville, on the Yahoo! network 
Mobile 

• 
Now turning to Mobile 
• 
Our reach continues to grow 
• 
In the U.S. alone, we’ve grown almost 15% quarter over quarter, with 45mm users and a 52% reach 
• 
And we continue to release apps and form partnerships 
• 
We recently launched new Yahoo! Mail and Yahoo! Messenger apps for Android as well as HTML-5 based 
Yahoo! Mail and Yahoo! News sites for the iPhone 

• 
These new apps and sites give users a faster, more sophisticated mobile browsing experience 
• 
We also deepened our valued partnership with top handset makers Nokia and Samsung to make sure Yahoo!’s 
industry-leading services are front and center with their users all over the globe 
• 
Our new alliance with Nokia has the added benefit of leveraging their strength in maps and navigation to enhance 
our products, and it helps us gain access to Nokia’s users in emerging markets, where their phones are especially 
popular 
Video 

• 
Another important content vehicle for us is Video 
• 
We all know that video adoption has grown exponentially, especially now that it’s easy for people who consume 
at their desk or on the phone, and it’s a format that advertisers really like 
• 
That’s why we’re working hard to integrate more of it into our properties, where we see video driving even 
more engagement for us 
• 
We’re also finding more ways to monetize it 
• 
Our front page now points to video with pre-roll ads 
• 
And next month the video that appears inline on the front page will have a new interactive ad format 
• 
At the same time, we continue to launch more of our original sponsored video snacks and they’re performing 
well 
Newsmaker Series 

• 
Earlier this month, on Yahoo! News, we launched the Newsmaker series 
• 
And already the first video in the series, about Warren Buffet, generated more than 2.3mm video streams 
• 
On Yahoo! Shine we also launched my favorite, Bikini 101, with Nivea 
• 
It targets women who are looking to get into shape for the summer swimsuit season 
• 
Pairing content with video is the perfect fit 
• 
The series is reaching roughly 200,000 uniques a day, and overdelivering what we promised for page use to 
Nivea by more than 60% 
• 
Remember, all the moves that I just talked about across content, social, mobile, video and local, were made 
with one goal in mind: improving user engagement 
• 
And it will continue to be a major goal for us in the quarters to come

Financial Results 
Revenue and Operating Income 

• 
Revenue grew 2% y-over-y to 1,601mm in Q2 

• 
That result was roughly 40mm below the midpoint of our guidance, with 6mm attributable to adverse foreign 
currency movements and the remainder split roughly evenly between Search and Display 
• 
Operating income was 175mm, more than doubling last year’s 76mm and right at the midpoint of guidance 
despite, the revenue shortfall 
• 
Excluding restructuring charges from both years, operating income improved 32% vs. 2009 
Operating Margins and EPS 

• 
GAAP operating margins were 11% for second quarter, again, more than double last year’s rate on a reported 
basis, and up approximately 260BPS excluding restructuring 
• 
H1 GAAP operating margins were also 11% on a reported basis, and 10% excluding the 43mm first quarter 
Search Alliance favorability related to prior year 
• 
It’s early yet, but we’re clearly making progress toward our goals of 15 to 20% margins by 2012, and 18 to 
24% by 2013 
• 
Finally, EPS grew 53% y-over-y to $0.15 per diluted share 
• 
As a reminder, prior year earnings were impacted by two largely offsetting events: a gain on the sale of our 
Gmarket stake and the restructuring charge referenced a few moments ago 
Owned and Operated Display 

• 
With that brief overview of headline metrics, let’s turn now to our revenue components and begin with Owned 
and Operated Display 
• 
Revenue grew 19% y-over-y to 468mm 
• 
Sequential growth registered a healthy 5% as well 
• 
We saw good momentum for most of the quarter, but as Carol described a few moments ago, we did experience a 
pullback in the latter half of June by a handful of large customers 
• 
The beginning of July has returned to a more positive trend line, so the data isn’t conclusive enough to draw any 
macro conclusions at this point 
• 
Revenue from guaranteed placements grew 23% in second quarter 
• 
Graphical display impression volume was strong and overall yields followed suit 
• 
Nonguaranteed revenue also grew in the low single digits 
• 
With respect to category performance in Display, revenue in five of 10 industry segments rose vs. last year with 
particular strength in retail, technology, and CPG 
• 
Telecom and travel were notably weak 
Geographic Perspective 

• 
From a geographic perspective, Display in Americas and Asia Pac grew double digits and EMEA grew middle 
single digits 
• 
As a housekeeping note, on April 1 we reorganized our business segments into three-region format, Americas, 
EMEA and Asia Pac 

• 
Our external disclosures now mirror this structure 
• 
The supplemental financial data in our press release contains revenue and direct costs for each region 
O&O Search Revenue 

• 
Turning to Search, second quarter O&O search revenue was 331mm, a decline of 8% vs. the prior year 
• 
Excluding our paid inclusion ad product, which was discontinued as of January 1, 2010, our Search revenue was 
flat y-over-y 
• 
Query volume grew by a little more than 7%, but that was essentially offset with an equivalent decline in revenue 
per search 
• 
However, it’s interesting to note that RPS in each of our individual geographies was closer to flat y-over-y, 
with the U.S. actually registering 4% growth 
• 
With lower RPS internationally and internal volume growth outpacing the U.S., the mix shift brought overall 
RPS down 
US Search Query Share 

• 
With regard to U.S. search query share, in second quarter we grew headline numbers as expected but fell a little 
short of our internal goal to improve the trajectory of monetizable searches 
• 
Nevertheless, underlying share dynamics did begin trending upward 
• 
For instance, the reach of Yahoo!’s search improved to 41% in Q2, – up nearly 150BPS from Q1, an increase that 
outpaced all of our competitors 
• 
In other words, we succeeded in leveraging our assets to induce more people to Yahoo! Search 
• 
Consumers are engaging with Search in different ways, and the products and experiences we are building are 
evolving too 
• 
Our strengths in media, content and communications enable us to interpret user interest and intent with 
ever-greater precision and at massive scale, regardless of whether a traditional search box is involved 
• 
While not all of these contextual searches, as we call them, monetize at similar levels as traditional search today, 
over time we believe they will 
• 
For example, the Trending Now box on our homepage is contributing three times more search volume this year 
than it did last year, and monetization has improved materially as well 
• 
At several hundred million Trending Now searches per month, that’s a big deal 
• 
Looking forward, we intend to leverage our strengths in both contextual and traditional search to engage users 
and grow revenue 
• 
Finally on Search from a category perspective, revenue is up y-over-y in five of our 10 industry segments 
• 
We saw particular strength in telecom, CPG and health, and weakness in entertainment 
Affiliate Business 

• 
Moving to our affiliate business, revenue grew 7% y-over-y to 557mm 

• 
Once again, Asia Pac, and specifically Korea, led the way 
• 
On a global basis, affiliate TAC rates finished the quarter slightly favorable to expectations 
• 
Rounding out the top line picture, I’ll now provide more color on our fees, listing and leads revenue 
• 
These businesses performed essentially in line with our expectations for the quarter, but both the y-over-y and 
sequential comparisons clearly reflect the fact that we’re progressing through a transition period 
• 
Our repositioning plans fall into three categories: divestitures, outsourcing partnerships, and internal reinvestment 
• 
Zimbra and HotJobs are obviously the lines we’ve decided to divest 
• 
Personals, Local and most recently, Real Estate, are examples of our intent to increasingly partner with 
best-in-class websites to help power our offerings 
Reinvestment 

• 
Finally, with respect to reinvestment, we’re returning focus and funding to Yahoo! Small Business, Shopping, 
Autos and Travel to grow these profitable businesses 
• 
While obviously unfavorable on the revenue line in the short-term, collectively these initiatives better serve our 
longer term growth, profitability and strategic focus 
• 
In total, the fees, listing and leads businesses declined in second quarter by 19% from prior year to roughly 
$245mm 
• 
Given the unfavorable prior-year comparisons associated with this transition period, we expect second-half 
performance to stay in the range of a 15 to 20% decline vs. 2009 
• 
So that’s our revenue performance this quarter 
Operating Expenses 

• 
Now let’s move down the income statement and discuss cost structure 
• 
For the quarter, total expenses, including both cost of revenue and operating expenses, were 1,426mm 
• 
Excluding TAC of 473mm, our expenses were $953mm, down 10% vs. prior year 
• 
Noteworthy highlights include the following: 
• 
As we’ve commented in the past, we’re committed to ensuring that our expense plans are consistent with our 
revenue environment 
• 
In order to preserve profitability this quarter, the business did a nice job across all functions to proactively 
moderate spending 
• 
As a result, expenses landed 27mm favorable to the midpoint of our guidance range, despite incurring $10mm of 
restructuring cost 
Operating Reimbursements 

• 
Operating reimbursements from Microsoft landed at the high end of expectations, thereby contributing to the 
overall cost favorability 
• 
As a reminder, these reimbursements are related to running our paid search and algo platforms 

• 
Ultimately, as we transition in each geography, these reimbursements will begin to step down and be replaced 
with permanent reductions to Yahoo!’s cost structure 
• 
In addition to the ongoing operating reimbursements, Microsoft is also responsible for up to $150mm of 
Yahoo!’s transition costs 
• 
This quarter, 18mm was incurred against this declining balance 
• 
These transition costs were equivalent to transition reimbursements, so the impact to our P&L was neutral this 
quarter, as expected 
• 
Since receiving regulatory clearance, Yahoo! has been reimbursed roughly 85mm of transition cost, so 65mm 
remains on the $150mm commitment 
Operating Income 

• 
Concluding the income statement discussion, as previously noted, operating income landed at 175mm 
• 
Below operating income, our equity investment line grew by 51% y-over-y 
• 
Yahoo! Japan’s results were the primary driver, with both revenue and operating income growing by 9% in the 
March-ending quarter 
• 
Recall that we recognize our proportional share of Yahoo! Japan’s results one quarter in arrears 
• 
Finally, the Yahoo!, Inc. effective tax rate was 36% for the quarter, toward the low end of our 35 to 40% 
guidance 
Balance Sheet Metrics 

Before moving to Q3 outlook, let’s take a moment to review a few key balance sheet metrics 
Cash and marketable debt securities ended the quarter at roughly 3.8B 
During the quarter, we repurchased roughly 32mm shares for $496mm 
YTD, including July, we’ve repurchased 63mm shares for $973mm, an average price of $15.40 per share 
Our 2006 share repurchase authorization has now been fully utilized 
On June 24, Yahoo!’s board of directors approved a new 3B authorization 
As I’ve said in the past, it remains our goal to use repurchases to offset dilution from our equity programs, but we will 

continue to be opportunistic as well 

Cash Flow and CapEx 

• 
Our cash flow from operating activities was roughly 347mm for second quarter, and 491mm for H1 
• 
As of June 30, our receivable balance with Microsoft related to the Search Alliance was approximately 75mm 
• 
CapEx was 190mm for the quarter, an increase of roughly 78mm from first quarter 
• 
The additional spending is primarily related to build-out of our more efficient data center and grid 
infrastructure 
• 
Finally, as of June 30, the pre-tax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in 
Alibaba.com was just over $11B, or approximately $8 per share 

• 
These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba Group’s 
privately held businesses 
Q3 Outlook 

Now let’s look at our outlook for third quarter 
Revenue is expected to be in the range of 1,570mm to 1,650mm 
This outlook assumes roughly $15mm of adverse impact resulting from foreign currencies compared to second quarter 
Traffic acquisition costs should remain roughly 29 to 29.5% of revenue 
Our total expenses less TAC are expected to be in the range of 945mm to $965mm, including D&A and stock-based 

compensation of roughly 215mm 

Transition Costs 

• 
We expect transition costs related to the Search Alliance to continue to be fully offset by transition 
reimbursement billings and for the Search Alliance operating cost benefits to be in the range of 75 to 85mm 
• 
Please note, however, that as the agreed-upon transfer of employees to Microsoft occurs and we move onto 
Microsoft’s paid and algorithmic search platforms, reimbursements will begin to fall and the underlying expenses 
will be removed from our cost structure 
• 
These revenue and cost ranges yield an outlook of 160mm to 200mm for operating income 
Operating Income 

• 
The midpoint expectation of 180mm would be essentially double the operating income generated in third quarter 
2009 
• 
Concluding third quarter guidance, we’re forecasting a range of roughly 35 to 40% for our effective tax rate, but 
would note that we’re in dialogue with the IRS over a matter that could result in a rate in the low 20% range 
• 
We’ll provide an update on this effort during our October call 
• 
Before handing the call back to Carol, I’d like to update our expectation for full-year total expenses less TAC 
• 
Given the second and third quarter efficiencies we’re generating vs. our original spending plans, we’re narrowing 
and lowering our full-year range to 3,795mm to 3,835mm 
• 
The midpoint of 3,815mm is down by roughly $70mm from what we shared with you in April, and also 
represents an 11% reduction compared to 2009 
Carol Bartz 

Operating Highlights 

Recapping Tim’s comments on the quarter, we’re pleased that revenue grew, Display growth is very strong, and Search 
is stabilizing 

We’ve got our arms around the listing, leads and fees businesses, but there’s a lot of transitioning happening in those 
lines and it will be a few quarters before we cycle through the changes and begin to see the results from our 


investments 
Finally, and most importantly, we’re making great progress on growing profits and margins 

Display 

• 
Now I’d like to talk a bit more about the ad market 
• 
First up let’s spend a little time on Display 
• 
Overall, the continued growth in Display reflects that the promise we’re delivering to advertisers, that only 
Yahoo! offers the science, art and scale needed for great online campaigns, is resonating 
Log-in Page Ad 

• 
Let me give you an example that most of you are familiar with: 
• 
The log-in page ad we previewed at Investor Day and rolled out in mid-June 
• 
General Motors was the first to use the new format and the results were simply fantastic 
• 
Those ads for the Chevrolet Malibu, Traverse and Equinox saw an incredible level of engagement from users, 
and we saw it across three specific areas 
• 
First, users who saw the Malibu log-in ad conducted seven times more searches for Chevrolet brand terms 
than those who didn’t see the ad – seven times 
• 
That’s a display ad having a direct impact on search behavior 
• 
Second, the day the Malibu ad ran we had the biggest spike in searches for Chevy Malibu we’ve seen all year 
• 
And third, on the day the ad ran, Malibu make, model and trim page views on Yahoo! Autos nearly doubled 
Traverse Page Views 

• 
Equally as interesting, the day the ads ran for the other two models, similar Traverse page views on Yahoo! 
Autos were up 32% and those for Equinox were up 50% 
• 
That’s what advertising is all about, the new log-in ad truly influenced consumer behavior to use our search or 
visit Yahoo! Autos for more information 
• 
So these are great numbers 
• 
And a big reason why the ads did so well is they just looked right 
• 
This kind of execution is a huge differentiator for us: we’re using artful and interesting presentations to drive 
engagement with a brand and its products 
• 
We have a huge digital canvas that we’re letting advertisers paint on, and it’s something no one else can do on 
the web 
• 
Those ads, of course, are for big national campaigns, but we’re also focused on growing the local ad market 
• 
That’s why we’ve established relationship with local publishers to help address their challenge of bringing 
more local advertising dollars online 
Partnership with Gannett 


• 
Last week, we announced a partnership with Gannett and their 81 local publishing organizations and seven 
broadcast divisions 
• 
Gannett will now sell Yahoo! ad inventory as part of their local advertising strategy, and in doing so, they’re able 
to take advantage of the advanced display ad targeting and ordering capabilities of our ad platform 
• 
In addition to ad revenue, there’s also a nice side benefit of the partnership 
• 
We plan to feature select Gannett content across the Yahoo! network 
• 
As for Search, we remain focused on growing our search business with an emphasis on search revenue, query 
growth and share 
• 
As Tim mentioned, due to mix, overall search RPS was down but we feel good that RPS was up 4% in the U.S. 
and the y-over-y trajectory is definitely improving 
Search Growth 

• 
We’re also gaining traction in improving our Search growth and as the latest June numbers from comScore show, 
we’re gaining share 
• 
While some of the gains were organic, others were due to changes in our site so they would be counted correctly 
by comScore 
• 
I know some have been confused or even criticized this approach 
• 
What’s not well understood is comScore results historically counted the same kind of activities differently on 
leading search engines, therefore resulting in inaccurate competitive comparisons 
• 
The new contextual search experiences we’ve introduced, like slide shows, for example, are not a matter of 
retagging something in our network and calling it search 
• 
These experiences are generated automatically using our search back-end technology and counted as a search 
based on users’ action and intent 
• 
The result is that people love them 
• 
It’s become another way for us to deliver personalization and relevance to users through Search 
• 
Meanwhile, we’re looking for gains to be driven more by organic growth later this year, when the results of 
additional efforts to drive more search volume are expected to take effect 
Search Alliance with Microsoft 

• 
While we’re on Search, let’s touch on the Search Alliance with Microsoft 
• 
The transition is progressing well 
• 
We’ve already hit several significant milestones that I’d like to share with you 
• 
This past quarter, we’ve transitioned more than 125 employees to Microsoft 
• 
We’ve started a regular cadence of communication to our advertisers and publishers in the U.S. and Canada to 
help them prepare for the transition 
• 
We’ve trained nearly 600 sales and account management Yahoo!s and continue to work through the feature and 
system enhancements for future releases across algo and paid search 

• 
I know that the timing of the transition is a question on top of everybody’s mind 
Algo Transition 

• 
The algo transition is progressing very well 
• 
In fact, we recently began internal testing on Yahoo! Search, where Microsoft will power up to 25% of our algo 
search results in the U.S. and a smaller percentage of paid search results 
• 
Speaking of paid, we’re testing, training and working with Microsoft to get ads that are ready to serve our 
advertisers 
• 
We feel good about our progress, but I want to continue to emphasize that because the holiday season is so 
important to our advertisers, we will not give the go-ahead for the U.S. and Canada unless we’re confident of a 
smooth transition with quality 
Q2 Recap 

Finally, I’d like to recap a few more events from the quarter before I take your questions 

In case you were hiding under a rock for the past two months, the World Cup has held the globe’s attention and 
Yahoo!’s been right in the middle of it 

When it comes to online coverage of the World Cup, our site was hugely successful, thanks mostly to our efforts to 
bring the event to users in new and innovative ways 

Special Soccer Channel 

• 
In addition to a special soccer channel on our network, we unveiled new shortcuts in Search and launched a new 
Yahoo! toolbar featuring World Cup coverage 
• 
That toolbar had more than 250,000 downloads and very high engagement 
• 
Scores and news modules received more than 50% of total clicks on the toolbar and initial engagement showed 
four times more click intensity and eight times more searches per user when compared with our normal toolbar 
• 
We also had the largest global launch of any Fantasy product yet 
• 
Fans were able to play the World Cup game in 22 countries and 10 languages 
• 
This is due to the investments we made in the underlying Fantasy platform, in line with what we did with the 
entertainment platforms that I talked about earlier 
Yahoo! Penalty Shootout 

• 
Last but not least, we had hit on our hands with the Yahoo! Penalty Shootout 
• 
It was a simple social contest that we created 
• 
Users played more than 2mm times for more than 11.6mm minutes 
• 
It was a great way to enhance user engagement 
• 
In the background of all of our content and advertising efforts, we’re also hard at work driving innovation around 
our products and technologies 

• 
Late last month, we hosted our third annual Hadoop Summit, attracting more than 1,000 developers 
• 
In case you haven’t heard of it, Hadoop is an open-source technology we pioneered 
• 
It’s also one of the most advanced software technologies in the world for crunching huge amounts of data, and 
it’s essential in processing the vast pools of data we capture in our Cloud to deliver everything from display 
ads to content 
Hadoop 

• 
Hadoop is a core technology that’s behind every click on Yahoo! 
• 
But it’s not just us 
• 
Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, and the rest of those 1,000 developers I just mentioned also rely on Hadoop and our 
approach to Hadoop development has earned us a lot of admirers, not just for the huge amount of technology 
expertise needed to build it, but also for making it open source 
• 
Technology plays an essential part in what we do 
• 
Hadoop and the great talent we’ve recently added demonstrates how we’re elevating science, technology and 
innovation even more within the company

So that was the quarter 
Concluding Comments 

Before we take your questions, I just want to reiterate what we talked about today 

Our metrics around margins and operating income continue to grow, as we told you they would 

We’re pleased by the performance of Display overall and the engagement numbers we’re seeing with our new ad 
format 

We made carefully orchestrated moves to deepen our focus on content and the social, mobile, video and local leverage 
we use to deliver it 

We remain laser focused on the Microsoft Search Alliance and transition, plus our own efforts to improve search RPS 
and volume growth are trending in the right direction 

• 
And from the World Cup to our Hadoop technology, we’re focused on creating industry-leading products, 
technologies and experiences for our users, developers, advertisers and publishers 
Q&A 

<Q - Youssef Squali>: Two very quick questions. One, Tim you talked about, or both of you talked about the 
weakness you saw in the back half of June. Do you have any clarity as to what happened? And when you say it’s back 
to earlier levels, i.e., has improved in the first part of July, are we back to that high teens type of growth rate, and how 
sustainable is that now going forward for Q3? 

<A - Carol Bartz>: I’ll take that first, Youssef. We really believe our customers are doing very wise expense 
management. Most of our big display advertisers are multinational companies. They have FX issues like everybody 
else does, and marketing is one of those areas that is easy to dial on and off. The interesting thing, of course, though, 
we’ve been watching very carefully in the first weeks in July, it’s like it never happened. It’s just back to the same run 
rate we’ve had which really has us believing that’s what it was. Also you’ve got to be able to look at the exchange, and 
it was definitely not a Yahoo! anomaly. It looks like this was something that was going on in the marketing display, 


which is why – normally we wouldn’t give you this sort of intraquarter information, but we thought we ought to mirror 
what happened in the last three weeks in June with what happened in the first three weeks of July. 

<Q - Brian Pitz>: Could you discuss why your page view growth declined 4% y-over-y despite the World Cup. I know 
last quarter we saw a slowdown to 0%? And second question, unrelated, are you still looking at transitioning the paid 
search platform to Microsoft in Q4? 

<A - Carol Bartz>: Let’s first talk about the paid search. It’s like I said in my comments, Brian, it’s very, very 
important that our advertisers are ready, that Ad Center’s ready, and we’re not going to pull the trigger, yes or no, until 
we’re sure of this. And we’re feeling very positive about algo; I’ve told you 25% of our searches are being run through 
the system now, but we only have a small testbed right now in paid. Obviously been increasing that as every week goes 
by, but paid is where we make our money so we need to be very, very careful as to when we transition that. We’re still 
shooting, as we told you before, for the October timeframe. 

<A - Tim Morse>: In terms of – this is Tim – in terms of page views, I guess I’d make a couple of contextual 
comments. They’re obviously a traditional measure of engagement on static websites, but the Internet has evolved 
through video streams, mobile experiences and rich web experiences where engagement doesn’t generate page views. 
So what we’re trying to do is move to more of a holistic view. Page views will always still be valuable because they 
closely correlate with the way display ads are sold, but improvements in ad effectiveness and ad platform technology, 
for instance, are enabling us to grow revenue rapidly without increasing page views. That being said, we are diving into 
the minus 4% we’re seeing; there’s more analysis to be had on this. It is, honestly, a little bit of a surprise to see it at 
that level. We need to break it, for instance, between – our Mail, Messenger and Community properties, and homepage 
and the media properties, for instance, because we look for very different dynamics there. As a proxy, I could talk a 
little bit about the comScore minutes for homepage and, for that matter, most of our other media properties having 
actually a pretty nice performance. Homepage was up in comScore minutes 10% y-over-y. So a lot of the initiatives 
that Carol talked about during the call around social, mobile, local, video and certainly our content strategy, all are 
certainly driven to increase that engagement, whether it’s a page view number that, again, we have to get a little bit 
smarter on, having just seen this one published, or more likely, minutes going forward. That’s where our investments 
are in creating that kind of engagement and we do think we’re starting to see things pay off. A last note on engagement 
is quarter over quarter, if you look at the minutes, again split off the coms properties, communications properties, you’ll 
see the rest of the Yahoo! properties grow about 10% quarter over quarter, so we do think that we’re starting to see 
traction out of our investments. 

<Q - Mark Mahaney>: Any thoughts on why you wouldn’t have seen a similar disruption in Search revenue in the 
back half of June that you saw on Display? And then mobile revenue’s almost certainly not material for you, but if you 
look forward and you think about when it could be material, would you hazard a guess: is it the volume is becoming 
material but the monetization, that’s what really needs to gap up, or is it also the volume as well? 

<A - Carol Bartz>: Search was actually sluggish for us. – It was basically sluggish for us the whole quarter. We didn’t 

– see any material change like we did in Display, Mark, those last three weeks. It’s – I think big advertisers are more 
likely to manage their budget with the big brand ads. So that would be my reasoning for why Search didn’t slow down. 
As far as mobile revenues, we’re seeing a lot more creativity in the mobile revenue, but it’s a very small percentage but 
very, very important because our customers are all experimenting. There’s – no longer – we used to have to force our 
salespeople to put on the spec so that they’d think about mobile, and now that’s not necessary at all. They’re all 
thinking about mobile and it’s very fast-growing; it’s still small. 
<Q - Imran Khan>: Two questions: I think, Carol, you mentioned that you tested very smaller percentage of page 
search on Microsoft platform. Can you give us some sense what kind of revenue per search pickup you’re seeing? Is it 
line with the expectation? Below? Above? And secondly, just to go back to your commentary about the weakness 
around large advertisers, is it any specific categories you saw weakness or is it more of a broad weakness among 
multiple categories? 

<A - Carol Bartz>: On the RPS the bucket test is still small, but I will tell you we’re pleased with it, so that kind of 
gives you a hint that so far things look on track. But it’s too small and too early. We started algo testing, bucket testing 


before paid, but it’s too early to comment on search, but there’s nothing alarming us at this point. As far as your point 
on who the advertisers were that slowed down, it actually was no specific category. It was just some of our large guys, 
a little CPG, a little travel, a little telecom, but it was definitely the big customers. 

<Q - Jason Helfstein>: So Tim, your results and revised full-year expense guidance suggest that tighter control over 
expenses. Can you give us a bit more detail about where these savings are coming from and if perhaps we could see 
some margin ahead of the Microsoft close, which would probably be a bit more aggressive than what you talked about 
at the Analyst Day? 

<A - Tim Morse>: Well, we’re really seeing it across the board. It’s fundamentally a different way we’re managing 
here. I talked a lot about it at Investor Day, but we’re taking a very multi-year view and we really have this concept of 
self-funding that we’re driving throughout the organization. And when you combine those two things, a multiyear view 
and a self-funding discipline, then what you end up getting is people not making decisions for these three-month 
periods, but making them for the longer term and having to actually make trade-offs and decide on priorities. And 
we’re getting much better at this now, so we’re generating an awful lot of opportunity within existing cost structures 
and finding more cost effective ways to invest in the business, like we talked about at Investor Day, more cost effective 
ways to do that as you become more creative and are forced to do it. As far as the margins go, having 10% for H1, 
excluding that 43mm of nonrecurring favorability in Q1 related to the Search Alliance, 10% is pretty good. 11% for 
Q2, pretty good. Again, when we were between 5 and 6% at this time last year. So we’re making an awful lot of 
progress. Again, we remain committed to being 15 to 20 by 2012, and 18 to 24 rolling that go-forward one more year to 
2013. So I feel good about the progress we’re making, and I can tell you the whole company is really, really 
contributing to it. So 


<A - Carol Bartz>: Jason, I would say that Microsoft is a wash, because if we have a cost, they reimburse us, so that’s 
a wash. Our top job here is to grow the top line, and so we’re not trying to squeeze every cost out; we’re trying to be 
efficient and effective, but where we can through acquisitions or through marketing or through more technologists 
we’re going to spend to grow the top line. So the expense numbers that Tim guided you to are, we’re not trying to get 
lower than that. That’s our guidance and that’s how we’re planning on running the business. 

<Q - Jeetil Patel>: Okay, two question. Can you talk a bit about pricing in the display ad business? Are you still able 
to command premium CPMs when you allocate more inventory from the remnant or undermonetized areas, such as the 
log-in page, into the business, are you still able to command the same pricing? And second, what rates of growth or 
decline were you pacing at in June vs. April-May? Maybe just give us a sense of how strong April and May were as 
maybe a proxy. 

<A - Tim Morse>: Hi, Jeetil. I would say on pricing, we have a very unique value proposition, and this idea of science, 
art and scale really is how we’re running the company. We see a lot of leverage off of those aspects of our business. So, 
yes, we see that the premiums are good for us. They match our value proposition. Our log-in page, as we talked about 
at Investor Day, definitely a very premium buy, and I’d just echo something that Carol covered in her script, which is 
we talk about the integration of the whole Yahoo! network, and to see how that log-in page, that Mail log-in page, 
influenced behaviors on Yahoo! Autos and in Yahoo! Search is just a terrific example of that, and a terrific example of 
how not only do we get premiums, but with pricing up, better targeting of audience buying, we have a terrific 
opportunity to rope all of this together to maintain our momentum, our growth momentum. 

<A - Carol Bartz>: Actually, to put it simply, our guaranteed pricing was up. A lot. And we’re getting a lot of quality 
through that guaranteed. And if you look at the mix between guaranteed and nonguaranteed, Class One are guaranteed 
up a lot. Nonguaranteed not up so much because people are valuing that inventory because we’re starting to train them 
to think about buying an audience, not just buying a site, and we’re just doing a lot better targeting. And targeting is 
still, at the end of the day, targeting is the issue. Because if you could target every individual specifically we’ve got so 
much inventory it’s absolutely crazy. It’s really about how we find each unique person, give them unique content, a 
unique experience and a unique ad; and if we can do 600mm of those day-in-and-day-out, we’ve got a hell of a 
business here. So it really is about targeting. 


<A - Tim Morse>: And then, with respect to your question on the intraquarter dynamics, I really don’t want to get into 
that kind of month-by-month but as Carol indicated, we did feel really good – we felt really good about the total 
quarter, let’s make no mistake about it, but really the slowdown we saw was that latter part of June. So things were 
tracking pretty much right in line through April and May, but I really don’t want to get into the month-by-month 
comparisons. 

<Q - James Mitchell>: Great. I apologize for kind of harping on the same topic ad nauseam, but given your Display 
revenue shift from June to July and Display price increases you made during Q2, and the launch of the log-in page 
display advertising late in Q2, I might have expected Display revenue to be up a little bit sequentially in Q3, whereas 
you seem to be guiding for overall revenue to be flat sequentially. Is there something happening elsewhere in the 
business that might offset sequential improvement in Display, or should I just attribute it to conservatism? 

<A - Tim Morse>: Well, let me just address the question I’m sure I’m going to get quite a bit: is is the guidance 
conservative, and I’d say look, our guidance always represents our best estimate of the range of outcomes that we think 
are likely. That said, there are three things that I’d call out. Is what happened at the end part of the quarter, mostly in 
H2 June, unquestionably has influenced our thinking for third quarter. Q3 is always a tougher quarter to call because it 
always seems to come down to September, and when you see things in Q2, like an absence of spot buying in those last 
couple weeks, it should make you incrementally more cautious. I would note, though, as the third thing, that I said this 
in my script, but there’s about $15mm of unfavorable foreign currency impact, Q3 vs. Q2. So if you go from our 16.01 
in second quarter, just for easy math, just on same FX basis, that’s 15.85 right away. So same basis 15.85 up to a 
midpoint of 16.10, we do see growth there. 

<A - Carol Bartz>: James, what I would also tell you, it’s no secret to anybody that consumer confidence is really 
weird right now. It was getting stronger and stronger in the spring, and then you see what happened in May and June, 
and, of course, our advertisers see that. So I think it’s just to add to the point Tim made, whether it’s FX or Q3 or 
whatever, we think this is appropriate guidance. 

<Q - Sameet Sinha>: Yes, thank you. Carol, you spoke about audience buying. Can you speak about how Yahoo! is 
positioned in that science, art and scale spectrum, and how far you are in the process? And if you can talk about the 
experience, what sort of effective CPM increases have you seen because of this behavioral targeting? And secondly, 
Tim, could we assume that since your CapEx has gone up and your OpEx guidance for the full year has come down 
and you spoke about data center transition, that is one of the things some of the expenses are moving from OpEx to 
CapEx? 

<A - Carol Bartz>: Let me first talk about audience buying. What Yahoo! has that’s so special, we always talk about 
scale, and I think you guys understand that. But with that scale, we have breadth and depth. So, for instance, it was very 
obvious always to target find a male on Yahoo! Sports, but when we started actually doing the targeting across 
properties and selling across properties, we found young males on the gossip sites, we found young males on the 
women’s sites we found them all over the place. And so, once we started targeting an audience and not just assuming 
things, but using our technology in finer and finer ways – and it still is, I think, pretty gross targeting but, we’re much 
more than just gee, young male or young female but where they live, income levels so on and so on, we get really great 
results and therefore, higher CPMs. And we’re just at the beginning of this, Sameet. This is a real area of advantage for 
the company. And since you mentioned science, art and scale, I think one of the most interesting things happening in 
the industry right now is that not only are people, advertisers, looking at Internet marketing, but they’re finally 
understanding that it can be very unique and very interesting. Let’s face it, those first ads in those first years are just 
goofy. The little banner ads and a couple words. But when you think about interactivity and the beauty of like the 
log-in pages, when you think of pulling people into experience, I don’t know how many of you saw a day we actually 
did our own takeover of the log-in page, we had a 3-D site. There’s so many things you can do now, and advertisers are 
kind of catching that fever, if you will. That Malibu ad was just beautiful, and people responded to it, and that’s just the 
beginning of what’s going to happen. 

<A - Tim Morse>: Sameet, I would say on the OpEx to CapEx question, the short answer is no, they’re really very 
independent things and you’ll be able to see because we break out depreciation are amortization and stock-based comp 


away from the more traditional core spending dollars. But I’ll say two things: first on the CapEx side, the bump was 
expected. We are just spending to support our infrastructure efficiency plans. I talked a lot about this at Investor Day. 
We’re spending on our Cloud infrastructure so that we can reduce our data platforms, our ad systems our development 
and Q&A infrastructure massively down by two-thirds, reduce those items as we invest in the Cloud. And then 
secondly on the data center side, we’re completely transforming our data center footprint, and that’s going to result in 
35% lower costs in a few years. So that’s the kind of stuff we’re spending on, yet we’re going to stay within this 600 to 
700mm range I gave for CapEx at the beginning of the year. I came out last quarter and I said, look, I think we’re going 
be at the low end of the range; I still think we are. All of the spending is very much in plan, but it’s not a substitute or a 
flip-flop with OpEx. They’re really pretty parallel but different paths. 

<Q - Ross Sandler>: Two questions. First on Search, you mentioned overall queries up 7%. Can you tell us what your 
internal data showed for query growth for users who actually enter a keyword? Or stated another way, what would 
query growth, excluding the Trended Now and Slideshow queries? And then second, in addition to Microsoft, you also 
recently outsourced Personals, HotJobs, Real Estate through various partnerships. Can you talk about the cost savings 
from those areas? And Carol, you just mentioned a few broad areas where you’re reinvesting. Can you give us a little 
more color on how much is going into the advertising program vs. some of the other initiatives? Thanks. 

<A - Carol Bartz>: Whew, that was about five questions. How much we’re investing. Well, just like we said at 
Analyst Day, we’re investing in making sure we have modern platforms. The whole reason we could roll out fantasy 
football or soccer into 22 international sites is because we had, frankly, global platforms. The reason we’re going to be 
able to roll out all these new entertainment sites in Q3 is we have a global platform, so we’re going to continue to 
invest in that, as we said at the conference, very important. And so it’s the engineering side of the business, and it’s the 
sales side of the business. You either make it or sell it. 

<A - Tim Morse>: Ross, the thing I’d say on search queries is those are the queries that I referenced on these calls. 
Those core bidded searches are what I talk about. I’m not talking about everything core and contextual there. I’m 
talking about the stuff that’s really at the core of web search. So 7% y-over-y was our growth. Much lower in the U.S. 
certainly, than it was internationally. And then I think you asked a question about the fees, listings and leads 
businesses. I talked about that in the script; didn’t break out profitability and probably will stick with that, not going to. 
But they’re about two things really. They’re about, yes, these are profitable businesses but they can be more profitable 
and they will contribute to our operating margin expansion plans. But it’s also about growth. It’s not about stunting 
these businesses. We are reinvesting in them. We are partnering with partners that we think will enable us to grow and 
enable us to focus on the things we do well. Not too dissimilar from the Microsoft Search Alliance. If we can partner on 
the back end with best-in-class sites and focus on the front end experiences and integrating them into, especially the 
rest of our display and search businesses, again, like the Mail log-in case demonstrated, we think that those pieces are 
really beginning to come into play here, or fall into place. 

<A - Carol Bartz>: Yeah, when you talk about Shopping, Travel, Auto, those are heavy intent sites, and so they’re 
inherently profitable. A lot of them were just old and their back ends hadn’t been updated. We didn’t have the right 
partners and so as Tim said, we’re really in a transition to look at the ones that give us the best ROI, that take the lowest 
investment, and I think we’ve found that. We have the three segments Tim talked about. So we’re reinvesting in the 
small business and the shopping and autos and travel because, frankly, they’re very profitable.
