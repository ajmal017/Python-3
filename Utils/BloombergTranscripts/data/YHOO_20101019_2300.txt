Financial Measures 

On today’s call, we’ll also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures as we talk about the company’s performance 

These may include total expenses less traffic acquisition costs, or TAC, and revenue excluding TAC. 

Reconciliations of those non-GAAP measures to the GAAP measures we consider most comparable can be found on 
our corporate website, info.yahoo.com, under Investor Relations

Business Results 

Vision 

• 
Before I get to how we did during the quarter, I want to reiterate our vision for Yahoo!, our plan, and how we’re 
executing against it 
• 
Yahoo! is an innovative technology company that operates the largest digital media, content, and 
communications business in the world 
• 
The key words here are innovative, technology, media, content, and communications 
• 
That’s what we’re all about 
• 
Technology certainly makes the Internet possible, but content and communication is why we use it 

• 
Content drives everything from search to social networks 
• 
The creation and curation of content is more important than ever and will continue to be as the use of the Internet 
grows and evolves 
Plan 

• 
As for our plan, it revolves around the two things we have always told you: growing our revenue and increasing 
profitability 
• 
Everything we’re doing is designed to drive us towards these two goals 
• 
To do this, we’re working to reverse years of decelerating growth 
• 
To increase profitability, we have to be extremely focused and efficient 
• 
And to grow our revenue, we have to grow our users and engagement 
• 
When I first arrived here almost 21 months ago, we stepped back and took a good look at the company 
Execution 

• 
To deliver higher profitability and stronger growth, we realized we had to make a series of substantial changes 
• 
We had to reorganize the company to break down silos so we can move faster, eliminate redundancies, and 
improve cost our structure 
• 
We had to organize and make better use of the incredible amounts of data we collect to improve the user and 
advertiser experience 
• 
We have answered a big question about how best to compete in search, which at the time was another declining 
trend for the company 
• 
And we needed to create fundamentally better platforms and infrastructure across the company so we could move 
more quickly to deliver the kind of quality content and experiences our users and advertisers deserve 
• 
Since then, we’ve been working hard to create a stronger, more disciplined, and focused company 
• 
This also includes making our organization more efficient, more lean, and more nimble 
• 
One byproduct of any change is always movement of people 
• 
Some people leave 
• 
Some get promoted, and some good new people arrive 
• 
The most important thing is making sure the right person is in the right job at the right time 
Business Initiatives 

Partnership with Microsoft 

• 
So with that said, what have we done to reengineer Yahoo!? 
• 
First, we’ve partnered with Microsoft in search and are executing a massive transition of our algo and paid 
platforms, beginning in the U.S. and Canada, all on schedule 

Apps Platform Enhancement 

• 
Second, we continue to enhance our apps platform to make buying and selling display advertising easier 
• 
We’ve been working hard beginning to move off our old systems 
• The result of that will be higher yields through better targeting, inventory management, and serving systems 
• 
Ultimately, we’ll be able to combine our Class 1 and Class 2 inventory and apps into a unified marketplace 
Business Diversification and Building Efficiencies 

• 
Third, we divested parts of the business that did not fit with our vision or our plan for profitability and growth, 
and we acquired companies that did 
• 
Fourth, we’re increasing efficiencies, bringing down our operating cost by more than 1.1B over the past two 
years 
Engineering Enhancement 

• 
Fifth, we’ve been working hard to revamp our engineering processes so we can innovate and get new products 
out as fast as the market demands 
• 
Sixth, we’re pulling our data out of silos so we can optimize in conjunction with the technology we use for our 
content grid in the cloud 
• 
The result will be a more personalized experience for users and advertisers that continues to get better and 
better 
New Infrastructure Roll Out 

• 
Seventh, we have completely revamped Mail and Messenger to deliver better, modern functionality and speed 
• 
And lastly, we’ve been working hard to roll out new infrastructure, like our just opened data center in New York 
that is one of the most advanced, environmental friendly in the world; and new platforms that allow us to better 
deliver content and experiences with a focus on local, mobile, social, and video 
• 
This last part is especially important because content is a huge driver of engagement for us 
• 
Our legacy platforms just weren’t able to scale 
• 
It was complex, time consuming, and expensive to get a feature or a product to market 
• 
So we began rebuilding and modernizing our platforms across the entire company to allow us to innovate and 
roll out new sites, features, and functionality much more quickly 
• 
We talked about this with you several times, about the need to improve our underlying infrastructure 
• 
This work is ongoing and we expect it to have huge payoffs 
News Platform Advantages 

• 
For example just yesterday, we rolled out our first global platform, News 
• 
Our previous News platform was made up of nine different code bases 
• 
It maxed out at 24 countries and 12 languages 

• 
The costs of adding additional countries and languages were prohibitive 
• 
We could hardly change anything, even here in the U.S. 
• 
The new platform by contrast is light years ahead 
• 
It’s on one single code base 
• 
It’s not limited by the number of countries or languages we can support 
• 
In fact, we can bring up new countries in a fraction of the time it used to take 
• 
We can do multiple experiments with content and ad placements in a single day 
• 
We can create a new page in less than five minutes as opposed to weeks 
• 
And it’s infused with an incredible amount of science and personalization 
• 
It’s search optimized 
• 
It runs our content optimization engine and much more 
• 
I met with the teams that worked on this just last week, and the engineers and editors are very excited 
• 
They can do things they used to only be able to dream of 
• 
It will dramatically change the way we innovate 
• 
It will improve both our user and advertiser experiences worldwide 
• 
That’s just one example, yet it illustrates the point I want to drive home here 
• 
To grow revenue and improve profitability, we have to move forward in a disciplined, sequential way 
• 
First you walk, then you run, finally you fly 
• 
Once we get the right things in place, like the new global News platform or the completion of the search 
transition to Microsoft, we can really fly 
Product Platform Work 

• 
We told you earlier this year on our Q1 call that we expect the majority of our product platform work to be 
completed by next summer 
• 
This includes our efforts to implement the next phase of functionality for our Display Advertising Platform 
app and our Exchange Platform are next 
• 
So we’re going to be relentlessly pounding away at these and other initiatives we have planned for our users and 
advertisers in the months to come, and we’re well on our way 
• 
As I just told you, we have two main goals: increase profitability and reinvigorate revenue growth 
Other Highlights 

Profitability 

• 
Let’s take a look at how these played out during the quarter 
• 
For profitability, we continued to deliver increasing margins and operating income 

• 
Operating margins more than doubled for Q2 in a row to 12% compared with 6% in Q3 2009 
• 
Excluding restructuring charges from Q3 this year and last year, income from operations grew 80% in the quarter 
• 
So we’re seeing very good progress with profitability 
• 
This past quarter, we delivered revenue near the midpoint of our guidance, which amounted to a 2% increase over 
last year, driven by 17% growth in O&O Display 
Advertisers Campaigns 

• 
Advertisers are clearly impressed by the science, art, and scale we can bring to their campaigns 
• 
It’s big reason why CBS chose Yahoo! for the online promotion of its fall lineup 
• 
The program spans more than a week and included two home page and three log-in page placements, in addition 
to buying out 90% of our entertainment properties 
• 
And it’s why companies like State Farm and Dodge recently launched sponsored video entertainment to connect 
with the consumers they want to reach 
• 
Our team in Asia continues to knock the ball out of the park with the highest y-over-y display growth of our three 
regions, well ahead of the market 
Innovative Targeting Products 

• 
We’re also seeing strong advertiser response to our innovative targeting products like Smart Ads, and new ad 
units like OPA formats and the log-in page 
• 
We had solid results this quarter 
• 
Our revenue growth would have been even better if not for two items related to the search transition: 
• 
First, search campaigns slowed as advertisers waited to move to Microsoft adCenter rather than entering their 
campaigns twice 
• 
And second, as Tim will explain later, when we transitioned the algo search, the new results were so much 
better that users clicked on the top organic results more and clicked on paid ads less 
RPS 

• 
Despite these transitional items, RPS was up roughly 1% over last year and last quarter 
• 
The last time RPS was up y-over-y was eight quarters ago in Q3 of 2008 
• 
We’re also intently focused on growing search volume, and we feel very good about the steps we’re taking 
• 
Case in point, the first in a series of enhancements to the search experience that we just launched are showing 
promising results, with increases in click-throughs and engagements 
Paid Search Transition 

• 
The very good news, as I’ll talk about later in the call, is that we expect the paid search transition in the U.S. and 
Canada to be completed this month, which will improve the quality of our paid results over time 

Balance Sheet Management 

• 
In the background of all of this, we also continue to effectively manage our balance sheet 
• 
We recognize the value of our assets and believe our stock is undervalued 
• 
That’s why this year alone, we bought back more than 7% of the company’s stock 
• 
I have more I’d like to share with you about our progress this quarter and some topics I know are on your mind 
Tim Morse 

Financial Performance 
Highlights 

• 
Today, we’ll address third quarter results, fourth quarter outlook, and also a cosmetic accounting change 
impacting revenue presentation that’s required as we transition to Microsoft’s paid search platform 
• 
Highlights of our third quarter performance include: 
• 
17% O&O display growth 
• 
107% operating income growth\ 
• 
And meaningful progress transforming our search business 
Revenue, Profitability, and EPS 

• 
Let’s begin with an overview of headline revenue, core profitability, and EPS metrics 
• 
Revenue grew 2% y-over-y to 1.601B in Q3 
• 
The difference vs. midpoint of our guidance was driven by the divestiture of HotJobs, which was completed in 
late August, and our algo search transition to Microsoft, which I’ll touch on more in a moment 
• 
Operating income was 189mm, more than doubling prior year for the second straight quarter and above the 
midpoint of our guidance 
• Excluding restructuring charges from both years, operating income improved 80% vs. third quarter 2009 
• 
GAAP operating margins were 12% for third quarter, again more than double last year’s rate on a reported basis 
and up more than 500BPS excluding restructuring 
• 
Finally, EPS grew 126% y-over-y to $0.29 per diluted share 
• 
The current quarter included $0.13 gain from the divestiture of HotJobs, and third quarter 2009 included $0.04 
gain from the sale of our direct stake in Alibaba.com 
• 
Excluding both of those non-recurring gains, EPS grew 86% y-over-y 
Owned and Operated Display 

• 
Diving into the top line narrative, let’s begin with another good quarter for owned and operated display 
• 
Revenue grew 17% y-over-y to 465mm, led by guaranteed revenue growth of 20% 

• 
Both America and Asia-Pac display grew strong double digits while EMEA grew strong single digits 
• 
From a big picture perspective, quarter end customer dynamics were stronger in September than June 
Category Performance 

• 
With respect to category performance in display, revenue in seven of ten industry segments rose vs. last year, 
with particular strength in retail and technology 
• 
Telecom was notably weak 
Search 

• 
Turning to search, third quarter O&O search revenue was 331mm, a decline of 7% vs. the prior year, but notably 
flat sequentially 
• 
Excluding our paid inclusion ad product, which was discontinued as of January 1, 2010, our search revenue was 
up 1% y-over-y 
• 
This quarter, we saw half of our search categories rise and half decline, with particular strength in auto and retail 
largely offset by softer results in entertainment and finance 
• 
Operationally, search query volume was flat both y-over-y and quarter over quarter, and RPS was up roughly 1% 
vs. both comparisons 
• 
That’s the first y-over-y RPS growth we’ve seen since third quarter 2008, an encouraging sign of stabilization 
• 
While the RPS trend is improving, it did fall roughly $10mm shy of expectations this quarter for reasons related 
to our transition to Microsoft’s algo platform 
• 
Specifically, as users experienced fresher and more relevant results on Yahoo! search pages powered by 
Microsoft, they clicked more on the organic results and less on the paid results, lowering RPS. 
• 
This accounted for the majority of the revenue difference relative to our expectations 
• 
We also noted a search page view decline as users found what they needed faster, and therefore clicked through 
to the next page of search results less often, lowering volume 
User Experience 

• 
Despite the unfavorable revenue impact in third quarter, the user experience is clearly better, and we’re confident 
that will lead to longer term volume and market share improvements 
• 
Likewise, our initial tests on Microsoft’s paid search platform are increasing our confidence that once the 
combined marketplace is fully tuned, the RPS uplift will be even greater than originally anticipated 
Affiliate Business 

• 
Moving to our affiliate business, revenue grew 6% y-over-y to 557mm 
• 
Affiliate TAC rates were in line with what we expected 
• 
But traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of total GAAP revenue exceeded our guidance range, principally 
driven by the mix impact related to lower RPS and the HotJobs divestiture 

Listings 

• 
Finally with respect to our listings, leads, and fees businesses, as expected, revenue declined y-over-y by 16% to 
248mm 
• 
On our last call, we had guided H2 revenue for these segments to decline 15% to 20% vs. prior year, so we 
landed at the low end of the range for Q3 despite divesting HotJobs 
OpEx 

• 
That rounds out my comments on revenue for third quarter, so let’s move down the income statement and discuss 
costs 
• 
For the quarter, total expenses less TAC were down 10% vs. the prior year to 935mm 
• 
The midpoint of our guidance was 955mm or essentially flat with second quarter, so we’re pleased to have 
generated roughly 20mm of cost efficiencies vs. both prior quarter and guidance 
• 
We’re making great progress on becoming more efficient, and that focus will continue in the upcoming 
quarters 
• 
Before moving on, two cost related housekeeping notes; operator reimbursements from Microsoft landed at 
81mm for the quarter, in line with our guidance 
• 
Transition cost reimbursements of 18mm from Microsoft once again were equivalent to the incurred transition 
costs themselves, and consequently the impact to our P&L this quarter was neutral as expected 
Other Income 

• 
Continuing down the income statement, other income this quarter included a pre-tax gain of 186mm related to 
our disposition of HotJobs 
• 
Farther down, earnings in equity interests grew 52% compared to last year, driven by solid results from both 
Yahoo! Japan and Alibaba Group 
Tax Rate 

• 
Finally, our effective tax rate was 23% for third quarter 
• 
We had guided a range of 35% to 40%, but noted that outstanding discussions with the IRS could reduce our rate 
to the low 20% range 
• 
The lower rate this quarter stemmed not from the IRS dialogue, but from our ability to offset most of the HotJobs 
divestiture gain with capital losses we generated in prior years 
• 
The IRS dialogue is ongoing, and expect it now to be resolved in Q4 
Balance Sheet 

• 
Now let’s take a moment to review a few key balance sheet metrics 
• 
Cash and marketable debt securities ended the quarter at just under 3.5B. 
• 
During the quarter, we stepped up our repurchases, buying roughly 62mm shares for $868mm, an average price 
of $13.89 per share 

• 
For the year, we’ve repurchased nearly 120mm shares for roughly $1.750B, an average price of $14.68 per share 
• 
That means we’ve repurchased 7% of the company’s shares since January 1st 
Cash Flow 

• 
Our cash flow from operating activities was roughly 347mm for third quarter and 837mm YTD. 
• 
CapEx was 164mm for third quarter and 467mm YTD. 
• 
We continue to focus on modernizing our data center infrastructure to drive operational and cost efficiencies in 
the coming years 
• 
Finally, as of September 30th, the pre-tax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in 
Alibaba.com was roughly $10B, or approximately $7.74 per share 
• 
These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba Group’s 
privately held businesses 
Revenue Transition 

• 
Before moving to fourth quarter outlook, I’d like to take a little time to walk you through how our GAAP revenue 
will change as we transition our paid search business to Microsoft’s platform 
• 
The transition will include two components: 
• 
The first is an accounting change that will not have any economic impact on our results 
• 
The second of course is the 12% revenue share with Microsoft that you already know about 
• 
Today, we present our revenue on what’s known as a gross basis 
• 
That is we record 100% of the advertising revenue for our O&O properties and 100% of the advertising revenue 
generated on our affiliate sites 
TAC 

• 
As you know, our affiliate business carries with it substantial traffic acquisition costs, or TAC. 
• 
And for GAAP purposes, that TAC is recorded as a cost of revenue on our income statement 
• As a result, TAC offsets the vast majority of affiliate GAAP revenue, so that the net effect is much smaller 
• 
As the Yahoo! and Yahoo! affiliate search transactions begin running through Microsoft’s paid search system in 
each market, accounting guidelines require a change in our GAAP revenue presentation for that market to net 
basis 
• 
That simply means that we will no longer recognize 100% of the advertising revenue generated on affiliate 
sites 
• 
We will only recognize the net revenue after traffic acquisition costs 
• 
Since the newly required accounting will take effect literally market by market as we move to Microsoft’s 
platforms, this transition will take until early 2012 
• 
Once we have fully transitioned paid search to Microsoft, our GAAP revenue at that point will look very similar 
to how our revenue ex-TAC looks today 

• 
In the meantime, we believe it is most helpful and consistent to guide and report our top line on the basis of 
revenue ex-TAC going forward 
• 
Doing so will much more accurately reflect the underlying dynamics of the business and facilitate 
comparisons to prior periods 
• 
For a simple example of the impact of both our TAC-related accounting change and the 12% revenue share, 
please see slide 14 in the quarterly earnings presentation on our IR website 
Q4 Outlook 
Revenue Ex-TAC 

• 
Now let’s turn to Q4 outlook itself 
• 
Revenue ex-TAC is expected to be in the range of 1.125B to 1.225B. 
• 
This outlook assumes that the paid search transition to Microsoft’s adCenter platform in the U.S. and Canada is 
complete by the end of October, and it incorporates our expectation that some of the algo related RPS and 
volume shifts we saw in September continue into Q4 
• 
Given the transition timing, we anticipate revenue share to Microsoft to be in the range of $30mm 
• 
It’s important to point out that given the magnitude of the search platform transition we’re undertaking this 
quarter, variability is inherent in our projections 
• 
As literally thousands of search advertisers migrate budgets to adCenter and adjust to a larger, more liquid 
marketplace, some of the operational implications and related financial impact are difficult to predict, including 
those related to our RPS guarantee 
• 
While we believe that the adverse volume in RPS dynamics will be transient in nature, caution is warranted 
nonetheless 
• 
We’re committed to transparency throughout the transition to Microsoft search platforms 
• 
We recognize that this quarter is particularly challenging to model, so we are additionally providing guidance for 
ex-TAC display revenue to grow 18% to 22% compared to the September quarter 
• 
The top half of that range is in line with seasonal average over the last four years 
• 
As a reminder, when comparing revenue to prior year, the Search Alliance transition, the Zimbra and HotJobs 
divestitures, and discontinuance of paid inclusion together represent roughly an eight point impact on growth 
Total Expenses Less TAC 

• 
Shifting to Q4 costs, our total expenses less TAC are expected to be in the range of 925mm to 945mm, with a 
midpoint flat to third quarter despite the upward pressures associated with a higher volume quarter 
• 
The operating reimbursements from Microsoft will decline slightly this quarter, and the underlying expenses will 
be removed from our cost structure 
• 
As a final cost related note, this outlook yields a full-year midpoint for total expenses less TAC of 3.765B. 
• 
That’s a 12% reduction from 2009 and a 23% reduction from 2008, and we’re not done yet 
• 
Returning to fourth quarter, at the midpoint of our revenue and expense ranges, operating income is expected to 
be 240mm; once again, double that of the comparable period in 2009 

Tax Rate 

• 
Concluding Q4 guidance, we’re forecasting a 15 to 20% effective tax rate as we expected number of discrete 
initiatives to be favorably resolved 
Summary 

To summarize where we stand financially, we’re pleased with our third quarter results 
Display growth remained healthy 
Search transformation is progressing well, and profitability has improved significantly, even as we invest to reposition 

Yahoo! for both greater efficiency and innovation in the coming years 

We also continue to generate significant cash flow and to redeploy funds to benefit shareholders via nearly $1.8B of 
share repurchases YTD. 
With that, I’ll turn the call back to Carol 

Carol Bartz, CEO 

Search Alliance 

Algo Search Move 

• 
I’d now like to address two areas I know are top-of-mind for you: a little bit more about the Search Alliance and 
our relationship with Alibaba 
• 
First the Search Alliance, we’re making extraordinary progress 
• 
As we’ve told you many times, this is an enormously complex undertaking with tens of thousands of advertisers 
involved 
• 
The fact that this transition continues on scheduled says a lot about the talent, skill, and determination of the 
teams here at Yahoo! and Microsoft 
• 
Last month we completed step one of the transition, completing the algo search move to Microsoft for the U.S. 
and Canada, our biggest marketplace 
• 
It happened on the exact day we planned 
• 
And after the algo switch, we were really pleased to see a big improvement in the freshness and relevance of 
the search results 
Transition Of Paid Search in U.S. and Canada 

• 
Step two is the transition of paid search in the U.S. and Canada 
• 
Over the last two months, we’ve been working closely with our advertisers and their agencies to move their 
campaigns from Yahoo! to Microsoft adCenter 
• 
As a result, 86% of billing transactions are completed; 97% of our premium accounts have transitioned to 
adCenter, and we’re now more than halfway through shifting our Yahoo! search queries to use adCenter 

• 
We expect the full shift to be completed on schedule this month 
Advertisers Transition 

• 
Step three is running the fully transitioned unified marketplace with Microsoft, enabling our advertisers and 
publishers to reap the benefits and efficiencies of a larger marketplace 
• 
Recall that Yahoo! is exclusively managing the Premier Search sales and related relationships for the largest 
advertisers 
• 
This puts us in an important strategic position to advise our advertisers and agencies regarding optimizing 
their online spend across our large combined search marketplace as well as our display offerings 
• 
Advertisers will in one buy get a full online advertising solution based on Yahoo!’s superior relationship and user 
insights 
• 
We’ve undertaken an immense amount of training for our sales teams so they can best anticipate and meet 
advertiser and publisher needs 
• 
Of course, it’s going to take time to get the marketplace to the state we want it 
• 
We’ll need time to fine tune and get the gears to mesh perfectly 
• 
It’s a big transition, and advertisers will also need to adjust 
• 
There’s a lot for our advertisers to get used to 
Microsoft’s Editorial and Trademark Policies 

• 
For example, Microsoft’s editorial and trademark policies are different 
• 
Some shopping aggregators will have to alter their campaigns significantly to generate the same results 
• And as advertisers adjust to the new bigger marketplace, we’re expecting to see days when advertisers will 
literally submit tens of millions of updates, causing some temporary swings in marketplace performance 
• 
Together with Microsoft, we planned in advance for these and many other situations 
• 
Our teams are ready to work alongside our advertisers while we aim to deliver a stable marketplace by the 
holiday season 
• 
By Q2 next year, we expect the U.S. marketplace to be fully tuned 
Alibaba; Yahoo! 

Next up, Alibaba; Yahoo! made the investment in Alibaba five years ago, and it was great foresight by Jerry and the 

team to invest in a strong, local player in the Chinese market 
To this day, no other Internet company outside of China has done as well with their investment in the country as we 
have, no one 

I have tremendous respect for Jack Ma, the Alibaba team, and what they’ve accomplished 
We know there’s tremendous value in the businesses they are growing 
It’s an important investment and we’re committed to a good, productive business relationship 

• 
Beyond that, I’m not going to speculate today or in the future on our investment with them 

Just know that as with any investment, we’re focused on maximizing value for shareholders 

Business Accomplishments 

Before we close, I’d like to briefly discuss some of our accomplishments last quarter 
The main focus is on our content strategy and how we use mobile, local, social, and video to drive user engagement 

Search 

• 
On the search side, we unveiled the first in a series of new, more visually compelling search results for 
information rich topics like music, movies, and news 
• 
We also improved our local search relevance 
• 
With content, our recently launched Ask America program is creating a social experience around the news, 
combining interactive polling with content, enabling users to read about important issues and vote 
• 
This kind of unique content experience is something only Yahoo! can do 
• 
It’s also leading to impressive engagement 
• 
We’ve had more than 7mm votes in the short time the program has been up 
Mobile 

• 
For mobile, we launched a raft of new apps 
• 
On Android, we released eight new apps, including a Yahoo! Mobile home page, Finance, OMG, movies, fantasy 
football, Sportacular, and more 
• 
On the Apple side, we upgraded the Yahoo! Mobile home page, released Sportacular for the iPad and iPhone, as 
well as fantasy football and an updated Yahoo! Messenger with video chat for the iPhone 
• 
Users can now make voice and video calls over 3G and Wi-Fi networks and connect with the PC. 
• 
And lastly, we introduced fantastic new mobile experiences for Yahoo! Mail on both the iPhone and Android 
Mail 

• 
Speaking of Mail, as you know, it’s a big driver of user engagement 
• 
Very soon we’ll launch our new Mail beta 
• 
It has great new communications, social and photo features, and a lot more 
• 
It’s also incredibly fast, which is important everywhere, but especially in emerging markets, where load times 
are so important to successful adoption 
Social Integration 

• 
And lastly, our social integration with Twitter will go live with the Mail beta 
• 
Similar to our integration with Facebook, people who use Yahoo! and Twitter will be able to link their accounts 
to view and share updates across both networks 

• 
It’s one thing to talk about the power of your Yahoo! Mail combined with your Facebook wall and your Twitter 
feed 
• 
It’s another to see it in action 
• 
We get lots of wows every time we show people their Yahoo! Mail at high speed fully integrated with their 
favorite social services 
• 
It’s just awesome 
Execution 

All of these items are part of our plan to grow our revenue and increase profitability 
And as I shared earlier, we’re solidly executing on that plan 
Margins are expanding 
Revenue growth is stabilizing after a long period of decelerating trends 
Display advertising continues to grow and is up 18% YTD. 
Product rollouts are accelerating as we modernize our infrastructure 
Our search alliance with Microsoft continues on schedule, and more 
At the end of the day, Yahoo! is a company with tremendous potential 
Our 600mm users and hundreds of thousands of advertisers are a testament to that 
We have a lot more work to do in the months ahead, but we’re clearly making progress 
And the payoff I believe in return to our shareholders will be substantial 

Q&A 

<Q - Youssef Squali>: As you transition search to adCenter, how long do you think it would take for you to recoup 
that 12% rev share you’re paying Microsoft? And if so, would you think it will be mostly from pricing or volume? I’m 
trying to figure out how to reconcile the negative 6% you reported this quarter with the 3% to 6% positive growth 
you’re looking to achieve by 2013. Thanks. 

<A - Tim Morse>: I would say that obviously the 12% revenue share is a headwind that we’ll have obviously 
throughout most of 2011. Thereafter, obviously the comps get much easier. As you look at it, I think what we plan to 
do is grow both volume and RPS. We have a certain mid-single digit RPS uplift baked into our model that we’ve talked 
about previously. We’re starting to feel certainly better at initial testing that that can be more, so we feel good about 
that. 

I’m not going to go out and say how long it will take us to overcome the 12%. But over the period, we’re clearly, 
clearly aiming to grow search revenue. That’s one of the big reasons we did this deal. It’s RPS uplift from the bigger 
and more liquid marketplace, and we’re innovating like crazy on search to improve volume. We feel good about both 
those. 

<Q - Youssef Squali>: Okay, thank you. 

<A - Tim Morse>: Next question, please. 

<Q - Jason Helfstein>: Yes, hi. I guess it’s a two-part question. I’ll ask it as one. I think what you’re trying to tell us is 
any drag that you see in Q4 is more search driven than display, and display accelerated in the back half; so if we can 


just get some color on that. 

And then just secondly, are there any statistics you can provide on mobile on any of these apps that suggest that once 
people move to a smartphone that their engagement, their time spent still remains high with the site or with Yahoo!? 
Thanks. 

<A - Carol A. Bartz>: Do you want to take it? 

<A - Tim Morse>: Yes, I’ll take the first one? 

<A - Carol A. Bartz>: The first one, yes. 

<A - Tim Morse>: So looking to fourth quarter, obviously if you’re looking sequentially, you’ve got $30mm worth of 
rev share that will hit us in Q4 that did not hit us in the third. You also, as I said, have the continuation of some of the 
volume and RPS trends related to algo that cost us roughly $10mm for a partial piece of third quarter; so you’ve got 
those two dynamics. You’ve got all the advertisers coming into the bigger marketplace. There’s a whole lot of moving 
parts there on search. 

On display, we’re going to see I think some pretty good sequential growth in line with what your expectations would 
be, not necessarily as strong a sequential growth as last year. We felt that last year, there was a lot of momentum 
building into the economy, and it showed in our numbers. This year, I think any of us would say maybe the economy 
isn’t quite as strong as we would have thought it would have been looking forward from a year ago. 

<A - Carol A. Bartz>: So it’s more normal. 

<A - Tim Morse>: So it would have been more normal, I think. Yes, exactly; so we have a little bit more of a cautious 
stance on that. And then feeds listings leads will be, as I said, down 15 to 20%, somewhere in there. I gave that 
guidance before HotJobs was divested. HotJobs now have been divested, so you probably want to adjust where you 
have a new point of that range, so a little bit heavier. But aside from that, that’s the color I’ve got on fourth. 

<A - Carol A. Bartz>: Yes, and Jason, on the upside, of course this was the quarter we really focused on apps, so a lot 
of these apps are new. But we’ve got over 50mm uniques in the U.S., and it looks to us like there’s a lot of momentum. 
In fact, one of the interesting issues we have with Mail is many of our Mail users check in all day long on their mobile 
phones, and that’s not actually counted by comScore as a mail page view. So fantasy, Mail, and especially the new 
Mail client that’s coming out, Messenger, we’re seeing a lot of uptick on these. So it’s still new both for Apple and 
Android, but you’re going to see a lot more of those apps coming out from us so that we have our users no matter what 
size screen. 

<Q - Jason Helfstein>: Thank you. 

<Q - Mark Mahaney>: Thanks, just a question on the display advertising outlook. I know at your Analyst day you 
talked about a CAGR of 13% to 16%. At the high end of your sequential guidance range for Q4 display advertising, 
you’ll be at that 13%. Comps get tougher. That means the growth rate could decelerate from there. Is there something 
more you need to do organizationally? Product-wise, are you expecting a big pickup in the display ad market that gives 
you confidence that the growth rate that you exit this year at will continue to grow from that level? Thank you. 

<A - Carol A. Bartz>: Mark, one of the important things that we haven’t talked much about with you guys lately is the 
app launch, which we’re in the process of migrating at the same time we’re doing search, is really important to the 
display market because it has much better forecasting, much better economic engines and prediction. And with the next 
release, we’ll actually unify the guaranteed and non-guaranteed markets, so you can have visibility across your entire 
campaign. So I think this was the promise that you guys all got a couple years ago. As you recall, I was very confused 
when I first came in about why everybody wanted to talk about apps, but now I know. And it’s the product that we 
were talking about then is here now. And it’s going to do a lot for our ability to sell an audience as opposed to a site or 
a position on a site, which is the next step in launching a step forward in display. The other thing, the fastest growing 
area of display advertising is video. So it’s really important for us to not only have video advertising but interactive 
video advertising, so that’s important. And frankly, when we talk about the four O’s; video is important, mobile of 


course, local. A lot of advertising is going to go to the local market, and we’re focused on local with a passion here. So 
I think there are a lot of areas that we can see with smart selling and product backing up with data and the right 
modernization platform with apps. I think we see a lot of ability to move forward on display in the next years. 

<Q - Mark Mahaney>: Carol, can you very quickly comment on these private equity rumors, if nothing else than to 
state that if some private equity firm came in with a massive premium, you would respectfully entertain the offer? 

<A - Carol A. Bartz>: As tempting as it is, Mark, to tell you what I really think, I cannot. You know I can’t comment. 
I can’t comment on rumors and I can’t talk about hypothetical this or hypothetical that. That’s just not what I’m 
allowed to do nor I should do as the CEO. We like our strategy. We like our progress, and that’s what we’re focused 
on. 

<Q - Mark Mahaney>: Thank you. 

<A - Tim Morse>: Next question, please. 

<Q - Jeetil Patel>: Great, thanks, a couple of questions. Your display ad business comped easier six points in Q3 vs. 
Q2 on a year-on-year basis. Revenues decelerated to 17% growth. And I guess following up on what even Mark said, 
just the sequential growth or the year-on-year growth seems to be about 11 to 12. Are you seeing just less improvement 
in pricing? Or is it that you need to build up your video ad capabilities since that is an important and rapidly growing 
piece of the business? I guess how do you get back into the growth rate range which we’ve been seeing in display, 
which is about 15% in that business as you look ahead over the next year to two years? 

And then second, I know that obviously the model is changing a bit with the Microsoft deal, but you talked about 7% to 
10% revenue growth from 11 to 13. Something like 18% to 24% operating margins, that implies about 1.6B in 
operating profit. I guess can you talk about how you’re progressing thus far against that metric in 2013? Thanks. 

<A - Tim Morse>: Okay. So with the regard to display, I think we had a huge fourth quarter last year. It was up 
something like 27.5% sequentially. That’s the highest of any of the last four or five years that we’ve seen. I think there 
was a tremendous upward pressure in the economy at that point, so it was a little bit unusual. Up against that tougher 
comp, we think we’re still performing well. As you observed, we’ll be in the double digits, that’s some nice growth. 
Even at that, it puts us in the 15% – 15%-plus range for the entire year, so well within that longer term 13% to 16% 
range we want for display. 

We’re going to continue, as Carol said, to work on the local aspect: video, mobile, social. They’re all going to be a big 
piece of the volume part of the equation. And then the apps side of things, the combined marketplaces for C1 and C2; 
very big in terms of the pricing and visibility there, that capability. So we feel good about the yield side, too, especially 
as we continue to leverage, as we’ve said, our science, art and scale and work with the really big customers and the big 
branded campaigns. So we feel good about where we’re positioned on display. 

As for progress in terms of getting to the operating income goals by 2013, I feel good. I feel that this year we’re getting 
our cost structure in line. As I said, we’re down 12% vs. last year, 23% vs. 2008. We’re not done yet. We’re going to 
keep going. We’ve got, as you’ve heard at Investor Day, an awful lot of things in the hopper that we’re actively 
working. Many of them again streamline us, make us go faster. Carol gave a number of examples of platforms that 
we’ve improved. She talked about the Buffalo data center that’s much more economical in addition to being more 
eco-friendly. So really across the board, we’ve got a lot of initiatives underway that will help us become a much more 
higher margin business. 

If you look at this year, you see last year 6% operating margin rate going to 12%, doubling the operating margin. That’s 
terrific progress in one year on not too much obviously revenue uplift. So there’s not a whole lot of volume leverage in 
that number. We are going to – obviously as I said, in 2011, I talked about this at Investor Day also, many of the 
headwinds over the three-year period are much heavier in 2011, but we still are executing on our growth plans. And 
over the period we feel great about our ability to leverage off of the investments that we were making last year and this 
year to get where we need to go for 2013. 


<A - Carol A. Bartz>: Let me just add to this. As you guys know, we made several very deliberate decisions, whether 
that was Zimbra, personals, HotJobs, paid inclusion, revenue we didn’t like on the Mail pages, and so forth, to clean up 
our marketplace and to make some definitive decisions about what kind of company we wanted to be. 

We also – listings, leads listings, small business, as we’ve been telling you and you can see, have been following in that 
15% to 20% range. Let me comment on that one first. That will change and start going on the upside by Q2. By the end 
of this next year, all of that compare that you’re suffering with and we’re suffering with will get clean, so all of this 
stuff that I talked about will be off as part of a drag. 

But the most important thing other than turning leads and listing around, which we have and we told you the timeframe, 
the main drag on our growth has been search revenue. It’s very hard to outgrow – I mean outperform something that’s 
dropping in the mid to high single digits every quarter. So once we get search stabilized, which we honestly believe we 
can, that’s why we did this search deal with Microsoft. We get search stabilized from a revenue standpoint and start 
going positive, listing leads positive, and display in these areas we’re talking about in that 15% to 20%, we’ve got an 
entirely different company here. 

But you can’t basically – if you look at the data from 2004, these growth rates have been falling every year. This is the 
first year we’re going to start seeing an upside relative to the data over the last six years. So 2011 is still going to be 
kind of messy because of all these compares I just talked about. But once we get to the end of 2011 and 2012, you’re 
going to have the correct TAC compare to Microsoft, as we talked earlier. Perhaps, hopefully, it’s not the full 12%; and 
all of these other things and us inherently growing our business either with great content or technology acquisitions and 
of course with our own inherent growth. And of course, Tim just talked about profits. What we’re not trying to do is 
take so much profit out of here we can’t grow. So we’re going be very – as we told you repeatedly, very careful about 
that because revenue growth is number one. 

<A - Tim Morse>: Next question, please. 

<Q - Justin Post>: Thanks. First just on the display traffic, which you have page views down 4%, can you give us any 
clarity on how fast your home page or other important revenue pages are growing? And then secondly on search, 
Microsoft hasn’t reported yet. I think it’s in a couple weeks. When you look at their search revenue growth, is that a 
bogey for Yahoo! if you think about a year from now? Or do they have the marketing budgets that you might not be 
able to compete with, but do you see any read from Microsoft’s growth on the search side? Thank you. 

<A - Carol A. Bartz>: Let me first talk about – Justin, let me talk about engagement and page views and so forth 
because we pay a lot of attention to that, of course. I actually think there are two big areas of engagement, and one is 
better content, more content, more interesting content. And when we think of content, I think of it as a content stack 
that at the top is our own original content, our original voice, which we have some of the best editorial talent in the 
online space, and of course licensed content. You know our deals with the various – AP, Reuters, et cetera. 

Pro blogging, we put out first news blog, pro news blog out six months ago, it’s called the Upshot. And in six months, 
we’ve gotten 80mm page views and 7mm minutes – I’m sorry, from 7mm minutes to 270mm minutes, so basically 
80mm page views, 270mm minutes, because we put professional blogging on News. And I want to comment more on 
that in a minute. And then of course, the bottom of the funnel if you will is crowd sourced, and that’s what associate 
content is all about. 

So better content, and then interactivity; one of the problems we’ve had with our site the last year and a half is we 
couldn’t get as much interactivity because of our platform problems. So to do a blogging event was an extremely hard 
engineering feat; six, eight weeks of recoding. And you just can’t have that if you’re trying to move with the 
marketplace; so blogging, comments, video, all the ways that one does interaction. If you look at our Yahoo! original 
videos, y-over-y, uniques have grown 52%. Minutes are up 35%. Streams are up 92%. In Europe, the page views on 
our media properties y-over-y on average are up 18%. So the way we’re talking about page views and minutes of 
engagement is great, better content, more interesting, more modern, more interactive. 

<Q - Justin Post>: Okay. And then the Microsoft search deal, do you look at their numbers? And do you see any kind 
of read across for Yahoo!? 


<A - Tim Morse>: No. Again, we’ve put out our guidance for that, put that out at Investor Day last year. That’s what 
we’re focused on. It includes our expectation. RPS will be a nice lift with the combined marketplace. It incorporates 
our innovation to grow volume on the Yahoo! network. We really don’t see any read through to Microsoft. So we’re 
focused on executing our plan, and we believe that the underlining trends are really going in the right direction for 
them. Next question, please. 

<Q - Imran Khan>: Yes, hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions, two questions. One, if I do the math, it 
seems like your average revenue per head count on a net basis is 318,000, on a gross basis 450,000. That sounds 
relatively low compared to some of your peers. How do you think – what can you do to grow the revenue per head 
count? Are you – do you think that the organization is bloated and you need head count reduction. 

And secondly, Carol, are you concerned that you are losing ground on the display advertising? I think Google talked 
about doing $2.5B gross run rate gross revenue on display. Some of the press reports we see that Facebook and some of 
the smaller companies are growing faster. So are you concerned that in the next 12 to 15 months we might have a 
situation that you’re losing ground on the display? Thank you. 

<A - Tim Morse>: I’ll take the first one. 

<A - Carol A. Bartz>: Yes. 

<A - Tim Morse>: So, Imran, I don’t tend to calculate revenue per employee. So I’m not going to comment on that 
other than obviously we’re trying to grow revenue. We’re trying to improve our cost structure. We’ve done a very nice 
job on the cost structure; cost down 12% vs. last year, down 23% vs. the prior year. 

Are we bloated? No, I don’t think we’re bloated. Is there more to go? Absolutely there’s more to go. And there’s a 
whole lot more of shifting cost out of places we’re investing today and into places that will generate better returns for 
us tomorrow. 

And so look, we’re expanding margins. We’re – absent a lot of the headwinds we’ve talked about – we’re beginning to 
see a lot of things go in the right direction on revenue. Display revenue being up again at the midpoint right around 
15%-plus for the year is a good indication of that. So the best way for those metrics, as I call them derivative metrics 
that you just referenced, to get better is to us just keep executing on our plan of getting into growth mode on revenue, 
letting that work through the bad comparisons. Things will get better. Just dividing by head count doesn’t do a lot for 
me, but as we see the margins expand and especially expand to this 18% to 24% range, we’ll feel terrific about it. 

<A - Carol A. Bartz>: Relative to display competition, absolutely there’s competition out there. We think we’re 
actually unique. We’re a leader in display, and our uniqueness comes from the fact that the creativity that you can do 
on the Yahoo! site because of the kind of content we have really allows the display advertisers to grab emotional 
attention, to advertise in a way that’s different than they might on a social network or another network. So that’s why 
we talk about science, art and scale. Because it is not only scale, which clearly the two competitors you have mentioned 
have. But it’s our unique ability to work with these large advertisers for a great campaign to use the science and data 
we have to allow them to reach their intended consumer as perfectly as possible. 

So there’s always competition. I think competition is just going to make us better. And let me tell you, we’re running 
really fast. We’re not going to give up this leadership on display very easily. 

<Q - Imran Khan>: Great, thank you very much. 

<A - Tim Morse>: Let’s do one more question. 

<Q - Brian Pitz>: Great, thanks. Given the significant ramp up in mobile usage and apps, and you even mentioned the 
fantasy football application, could you talk about what you’re doing to really start to monetize display on mobile? And 
just a quick housekeeping; can you talk about what your D&A assumptions are embedded in your Q4 guidance? 
Thanks. 


<A - Carol A. Bartz>: Mobile advertising is a very fast growing area for all of us, off a small base, and we have 
exactly those kind of numbers. The advertising, the campaigns, the full platform campaigns that our large advertisers 
are looking to do, we’re working with them on that; again, from the small screen through the netbook size screen or 
iPad size screen right onto the PC. So we are working extremely hard with these advertisers to help them understand 
how best to put creativity on that small screen. 

We’re all working on that together because it’s a new area. But all major brands want to have the pull-through again to 
optimize for size screens. So we used to – it’s interesting. When I got here a couple years ago, we actually could list all 
the people that would advertise on mobile devices. And we had a meeting just recently. The list is so long. It’s all the 
major brands, obviously internationally it’s important especially in emerging parts of the world where that phone is 
their entree. So we’re working with these big brands to make sure we have our piece of the growth here. 

<A - Tim Morse>: On the housekeeping note, Brian, in third quarter, stock-based comp, depreciation, and 
restructuring were around a little less than 220mm. We see it probably eking up a little bit in Q4, call it low 220s.
